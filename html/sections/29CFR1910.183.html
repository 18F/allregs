                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Briefing. Prior to each day's operation a briefing shall be  conducted. This briefing shall set forth the plan of operation for the  pilot and ground personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Slings and tag lines. Loads shall be properly slung. Tag lines  shall be of a length that will not permit their being drawn up into the  rotors. Pressed sleeve, swedged eyes, or equivalent means shall be used  for all freely suspended loads to prevent hand splices from spinning  open or cable clamps from loosening.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cargo hooks. All electrically operated cargo hooks shall have  the electrical activating device so designed and installed as to prevent  inadvertent operation. In addition, these cargo hooks shall be equipped  with an emergency mechanical control for releasing the load. The  employer shall ensure that the hooks are tested prior to each day's  operation by a competent person to determine that the release functions  properly, both electrically and mechanically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Personal protective equipment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Personal protective equipment  shall be provided and the employer shall ensure its use by employees  receiving the load. Personal protective equipment shall consist of  complete eye protection and hardhats secured by chinstraps.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loose-fitting clothing likely to flap in rotor downwash, and  thus be snagged on the hoist line, may not be worn.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Loose gear and objects. The employer shall take all necessary  precautions to protect employees from flying objects in the rotor  downwash.   All loose gear within 100 feet of the place of lifting the load or  depositing the load, or within all other areas susceptible to rotor  downwash, shall be secured or removed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Housekeeping. Good housekeeping shall be maintained in all  helicopter loading and unloading areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Load safety. The size and weight of loads, and the manner in  which loads are connected to the helicopter shall be checked. A lift may  not be made if the helicopter operator believes the lift cannot be made  safely.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Hooking and unhooking loads. When employees perform work under  hovering craft, a safe means of access shall be provided for employees  to reach the hoist line hook and engage or disengage cargo slings.  Employees may not be permitted to perform work under hovering craft  except when necessary to hook or unhook loads.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Static charge. Static charge on the suspended load shall be  dissipated with a grounding device before ground personnel touch the  suspended load, unless protective rubber gloves are being worn by all  ground personnel who may be required to touch the suspended load.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Weight limitation. The weight of an external load shall not  exceed the helicopter manufacturer's rating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Ground lines. Hoist wires or other gear, except for pulling  lines or conductors that are allowed to ``pay out'' from a container or  roll off a reel, shall not be attached to any fixed ground structure, or  allowed to foul on any fixed structure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Visibility. Ground personnel shall be instructed and the  employer shall ensure that when visibility is reduced by dust or other  conditions, they shall exercise special caution to keep clear of main  and stabilizing rotors. Precautions shall also be taken by the employer  to eliminate, as far as practical, the dust or other conditions reducing  the visibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Signal systems. The employer shall instruct the aircrew and  ground personnel on the signal systems to be used and shall review the  system with the employees in advance of hoisting the load. This applies  to both radio and hand signal systems. Hand signals, where used, shall  be as shown in Figure N-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Approach distance. No employee shall be permitted to approach  within 50 feet of the helicopter when the rotor blades are turning,  unless his work duties require his presence in that area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Approaching helicopter. The employer shall instruct employees,  and shall ensure, that whenever approaching or leaving a helicopter  which has its blades rotating, all employees shall remain in full view  of the pilot and keep in a crouched position. No employee shall be  permitted to work in the area from the cockpit or cabin rearward while  blades are rotating, unless authorized by the helicopter operator to  work there.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Personnel. Sufficient ground personnel shall be provided to  ensure that helicopter loading and unloading operations can be performed  safely.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Communications. There shall be constant reliable communication  between the pilot and a designated employee of the ground crew who acts  as a signalman during the period of loading and unloading. The signalman  shall be clearly distinguishable from other ground personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Fires. Open fires shall not be permitted in areas where they  could be spread by the rotor downwash.
