A product may consist of the technical grade of active ingredient only, or may contain inert ingredients, such as stabilizers or solvents.</p><p class="depth0">Nominal concentration means the amount of an ingredient which is expected to be present in a typical sample of a pesticide product at the time the product is produced, expressed as a percentage by weight.</p><p class="depth0">Starting material means a substance used to synthesize or purify a technical grade of active ingredient (or the practical equivalent of the technical grade ingredient if the technical grade cannot be isolated) by chemical reaction.</p><p class="depth0">Technical grade of active ingredient means a material containing an active ingredient:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Which contains no inert ingredient, other than one used for purification of the active ingredient; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Which is produced on a commercial or pilot plant production scale (whether or not it is ever held for sale).</p>
