Generally, deductions are made no later than the beginning of the first pay period immediately following the date the reemployed annuitant files the election with the employing agency. When the annuitant elects to have deductions made, he or she may not change the election during continuous service with that agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The amount of basic pay prior to offset of annuity under Sec. 837.303 of this part is used in computing the amount of deductions. The rate of retirement deductions is that which attaches to the position under the provisions of sections 8334(a), 8334(k), or 8422(a) of title 5, United States Code, as is applicable.</p>
