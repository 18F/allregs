                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Hazard assessments and precautions inside the work zone. Before  beginning equipment operations, the employer must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify the work zone by either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Demarcating boundaries (such as with flags, or a device such as  a range limit device or range control warning device) and prohibiting  the operator from operating the equipment past those boundaries, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Defining the work zone as the area 360 degrees around the  equipment, up to the equipment's maximum working radius.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, or Option (3) of this section,  as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Option (1)--Deenergize and ground. Confirm from the utility  owner/operator that the power line has been deenergized and visibly  grounded at the worksite.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Option (2)--20 foot clearance. Ensure that no part of the  equipment, load line, or load (including rigging and lifting  accessories), gets closer than 20 feet to the power line by implementing  the measures specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Option (3)--Table A clearance. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Determine the line's  voltage and the minimum approach distance permitted under Table A (see  Sec. 1926.1408).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Determine if any part of the equipment, load line or load  (including rigging and lifting accessories), while operating up to the  equipment's maximum working radius in the work zone, could get closer  than the minimum approach distance of the power line permitted under  Table A (see Sec. 1926.1408). If so, then the employer must follow the  requirements in paragraph (b) of this section to ensure that no part of  the equipment, load line, or load (including rigging and lifting  accessories), gets closer to the line than the minimum approach  distance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preventing encroachment/electrocution. Where encroachment  precautions are required under Option (2) or Option (3) of this section,  all of the following requirements must be met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct a planning meeting with the operator and the other  workers who will be in the area of the equipment or load to review the  location of the power line(s), and the steps that will be implemented to  prevent encroachment/electrocution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If tag lines are used, they must be non-conductive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section). If the operator  is unable to see the elevated warning line, a dedicated spotter must be  used as described in Sec. 1926.1408(b)(4)(ii) in addition to  implementing one of the measures described in Sec. Sec.  1926.1408(b)(4)(i), (iii), (iv) and (v).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Implement at least one of the following measures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A proximity alarm set to give the operator sufficient warning to  prevent encroachment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A dedicated spotter who is in continuous contact with the  operator. Where this measure is selected, the dedicated spotter must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Be equipped with a visual aid to assist in identifying the  minimum clearance distance. Examples of a visual aid include, but are  not limited to: A clearly visible line painted on the ground; a clearly  visible line of stanchions; a set of clearly visible line-of-sight  landmarks (such as a fence post behind the dedicated spotter and a  building corner ahead of the dedicated spotter).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Be positioned to effectively gauge the clearance distance.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Where necessary, use equipment that enables the dedicated  spotter to communicate directly with the operator.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Give timely information to the operator so that the required  clearance distance can be maintained.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A device that automatically warns the operator when to stop  movement, such as a range control warning device. Such a device must be  set to give the operator sufficient warning to prevent encroachment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A device that automatically limits range of movement, set to  prevent encroachment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An insulating link/device, as defined in Sec. 1926.1401,  installed at a point between the end of the load line (or below) and the  load.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section do not  apply to work covered by subpart V of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Voltage information. Where Option (3) of this section is used,  the utility owner/operator of the power lines must provide the requested  voltage information within two working days of the employer's request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Operations below power lines. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No part of the equipment, load  line, or load (including rigging and lifting accessories) is allowed  below a power line unless the employer has confirmed that the utility  owner/operator has deenergized and (at the worksite) visibly grounded  the power line, except where one of the exceptions in paragraph (d)(2)  of this section applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. Paragraph (d)(1) of this section is inapplicable  where the employer demonstrates that one of the following applies:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The work is covered by subpart V of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For equipment with non-extensible booms: The uppermost part of  the equipment, with the boom at true vertical, would be more than 20  feet below the plane of the power line or more than the Table A of this  section minimum clearance distance below the plane of the power line.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For equipment with articulating or extensible booms: The  uppermost part of the equipment, with the boom in the fully extended  position, at true vertical, would be more than 20 feet below the plane  of the power line or more than the Table A of this section minimum  clearance distance below the plane of the power line.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The employer demonstrates that compliance with paragraph (d)(1)  of this section is infeasible and meets the requirements of Sec.  1926.1410.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Power lines presumed energized. The employer must assume that  all power lines are energized unless the utility owner/operator confirms  that the power line has been and continues to be deenergized and visibly  grounded at the worksite.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When working near transmitter/communication towers where the  equipment is close enough for an electrical charge to be induced in the  equipment or materials being handled, the transmitter must be  deenergized or the following precautions must be taken:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The equipment must be provided with an electrical ground.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If tag lines are used, they must be non-conductive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Training.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer must train each operator and crew member assigned  to work with the equipment on all of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The procedures to be followed in the event of electrical contact  with a power line. Such training must include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Information regarding the danger of electrocution from the  operator simultaneously touching the equipment and the ground.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The importance to the operator's safety of remaining inside the  cab except where there is an imminent danger of fire, explosion, or  other emergency that necessitates leaving the cab.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The safest means of evacuating from equipment that may be  energized.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The danger of the potentially energized zone around the  equipment (step potential).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The need for crew in the area to avoid approaching or touching  the equipment and the load.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Safe clearance distance from power lines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Power lines are presumed to be energized unless the utility  owner/operator confirms that the power line has been and continues to be  deenergized and visibly grounded at the worksite.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Power lines are presumed to be uninsulated unless the utility  owner/operator or a registered engineer who is a qualified person with  respect to electrical power transmission and distribution confirms that  a line is insulated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The limitations of an insulating link/device, proximity alarm,  and range control (and similar) device, if used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The procedures to be followed to properly ground equipment and  the limitations of grounding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employees working as dedicated spotters must be trained to  enable them to effectively perform their task, including training on the  applicable requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Training under this section must be administered in accordance  with Sec. 1926.1430(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Devices originally designed by the manufacturer for use as: A  safety device (see Sec. 1926.1415), operational aid, or a means to  prevent power line contact or electrocution, when used to comply with  this section, must meet the manufacturer's procedures for use and  conditions of use.</p><p class="depth2">Table A--Minimum Clearance Distances ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Voltage (nominal, kV, alternating        Minimum clearance distance</p><p class="depth2">current)                              (feet) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ up to 50...............................                 10 over 50 to 200.........................                 15 over 200 to 350........................                 20 over 350 to 500........................                 25 over 500 to 750........................                 35 over 750 to 1,000......................                 45 over 1,000.............................
