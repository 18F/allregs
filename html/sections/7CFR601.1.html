                            <p class="depth0">The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is the Federal  agency that works with private landowners to conserve their natural  resources. NRCS employees help land users and communities approach  conservation planning and implementation with an understanding of how  natural resources relate to each other and to people--and how human  activities affect those resources. The agency emphasizes voluntary,  science-based assistance, partnerships, and cooperative problem solving  at the community level. The mission of NRCS is to work on the Nation's  non-Federal lands to conserve, improve, and sustain natural resources.  The following functions support the mission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NRCS facilitates and provides conservation technical assistance  at the local level that helps people assess their natural resource  conditions and needs, set goals, identify programs and other resources  to address those needs, develop proposals and recommendations, implement  solutions, and measure their success. The agency's role is to assist  with:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Resource inventories,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Resource assessments,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Planning assistance, and/or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Technical assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> NRCS provides technical assistance through local conservation  districts to land users, communities, watershed groups, Federal and  State agencies, other partners, and customers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NRCS provides assistance on a voluntary basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The agency's work focuses on soil, water, air, plant, and animal  conservation including erosion reduction, water quality improvement,  wetland restoration and protection, fish and wildlife habitat  improvement, range management, stream restoration, water management, and  other natural resource issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Through the conservation operations program, NRCS maintains a  cadre of conservationists and interdisciplinary technical experts who  provide landowners with advice and recommendations. Science based  procedures and techniques are based on new knowledge and research  provided by the Agricultural Research Service and others. NRCS developed  and maintains a system of directives--including manuals, handbooks, and  technical references--to institutionalize new methods, procedures, and  standards used to deliver technical assistance at the field level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> NRCS has general responsibility for administration of the  following programs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conservation operations, authorized by the Soil Conservation Act  of 1935 and the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977.  Activities include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conservation technical assistance to land users, communities,  units of State and local government, and other Federal agencies in  planning and implementing natural resource solutions to reduce erosion,  improve soil and water quantity and quality, improve and conserve  wetlands, enhance fish and wildlife habitat, improve air quality,  improve pasture and range conditions, reduce upstream flooding, and  improve woodlands. Assistance is also provided to implement the highly  erodible land (HEL) and wetland conservation (Swampbuster) provisions  and--on a reimbursable basis--the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and  Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the 1985 Food Security Act, as  amended by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 and  Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996. NRCS technical  field staff make HEL and wetland determinations and assist land users to  develop and implement conservation plans needed   to ensure compliance with the law. NRCS is also the lead Federal agency  for delineating wetlands on agricultural lands for purposes of  implementing both the provisions of the Food Security Act and Section  404 of the Clean Water Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Soil surveys that provide the public with local information on  the uses and capabilities of their soil resource. Soil surveys are based  on scientific analysis and classification of the soils and are used to  determine land capabilities and conservation treatment needs. Surveys  are conducted cooperatively with other Federal agencies, land grant  universities, State agencies, and local units of government. NRCS is the  world leader in soil classification and soil mapping, and is expanding  into soil quality.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Snow survey and water supply forecasts that provide western  States and Alaska with vital information and forecasts of seasonable  variable water supplies. NRCS field staff in cooperation with partnering  organizations manually collect data from 850 remote high mountain sites.  Data is electronically collected from an additional 600 SNOTEL  (automated snowpack telemetry network) sites. In cooperation with the  National Weather Service, the data is assembled and analyzed. Then, NRCS  staff develop seasonal water supply forecasts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Plant Material Centers that assemble, test, and encourage  increased plant propagation and usefulness of plant species for biomass  production, carbon sequestration, erosion reduction, wetland  restoration, water quality improvement, streambank and riparian area  protection, coastal dune stabilization, and to meet other special  conservation treatment needs. The work is carried out cooperatively with  State and Federal agencies, private organizations, commercial  businesses, and seed and nursery associations. After species are proven,  they are released to the private sector for commercial production.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> National Resources Inventory (NRI) that is a statistically-based  survey designed and implemented using scientific principles to assess  conditions and trends of soil, water, and related resources on  nonfederal lands in the United States. The NRI captures data on land  cover and use, soil erosion, prime farmland, wetlands, habitat  diversity, selected conservation practices, and related attributes at  thousands of scientifically selected sample sites in all 50 states,  Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and some Pacific Basin locations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conservation programs in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and  Reform Act of 1996, most of which are funded by the Commodity Credit  Corporation (CCC). NRCS provides leadership and technical assistance for  the following programs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). EQIP provides a  single, voluntary conservation program for farmers and ranchers who face  serious threats to soil, water, and related natural resources.  Nationally, it provides technical, financial, and educational  assistance, half of it targeted to livestock-related natural resource  problems and half to more general conservation priorities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). WRP is a voluntary program to  restore and protect wetlands on private property. It provides an  opportunity for landowners to receive financial incentives to restore  wetlands in exchange for retiring marginal agricultural land.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP). WHIP is a  voluntary program for people who want to develop and improve wildlife  habitat on private lands. It provides both technical assistance and cost  sharing to help establish and improve fish and wildlife habitat.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Farmland Protection Program (FPP). This program provides funds  to help purchase development rights to keep productive farmland in  agricultural use. Working through existing programs, USDA joins with  State, tribal, or local governments to acquire voluntary conservation  easements or other interests from landowners.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Forestry Incentives Program (FIP). FIP supports good forest  management practices on privately owned, non-industrial forest lands  nationwide. FIP is designed to benefit the environment while meeting  future demands for wood products. Although not funded by CCC, Section  373 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996   extended the program under discretionary appropriations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D;) Program, authorized  by Section 102 of the Flood and Agriculture Act of 1962 (Pub. L. 87-702)  and Sections 1528-1538 of the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 (Pub. L.  97-98). This program is initiated and directed at the local level by  volunteers who involve multiple communities, various units of  government, municipalities, and grassroots organizations. RC&D; is a  catalyst for civic-oriented groups to share knowledge and resources in a  collective attempt to solve common problems. The program offers aid in  balancing the environmental, economic, and social needs of an area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rural Abandoned Mine Program (RAMP) and other responsibilities  assigned under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977  (Pub. L. 95-87). Under RAMP, NRCS provides technical and financial  assistance to landowners to reclaim certain abandoned coal-mined lands.  This assistance can be used to reclaim these lands for approved uses,  which include pasture, range, woodland, cropland, noncommercial  recreation, and wildlife habitat. The program's first priority is to  protect public health, welfare, safety, and property from hazards caused  by past surface coal mining or by surface effects of deep mining.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Watershed surveys and planning, authorized by the Watershed  Protection and Flood Prevention Act (Pub. L. 83-566, Section 6 (16  U.S.C. 1001-1008)). The 1996 appropriations act combined the Small  Watershed Planning and the River Basin Surveys and Investigations  programs into a new program called the Watershed Surveys and Planning  Program. The program involves cooperation with other Federal, State, and  local agencies to conduct watershed planning, river basin surveys and  investigations, flood hazard analysis, and floodplain management  assistance, which aid in the development of coordinated water resource  programs, including the development of guiding principles and  procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Watershed and flood prevention operations include several  activities. Watershed operations are authorized by the Flood Control Act  of 1944 (Public Law 78-534) and the Watershed Protection and Flood  Prevention Act of 1954 (Public Law 87-566) and amendments; both of which  are addressed by 7 CFR 622. Since 1998, the appropriations act for the  Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (Public Law 83-566) has  included funds, not to exceed a specified amount, that may be used for  Public Law 78-534 projects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Publc Law 83-566 and Public Law 78-534, jointly called the Small  Watershed Program, authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to cooperate  with State and local agencies to plan and carry out works of improvement  for flood prevention; for the conservation, development, utilization,  and disposal of water; and for the conservation and proper use of land  in watershed or sub-watershed areas. Under Public Law 83-566, these  areas shall not exceed 250,000 acres. There is no acreage limitation  under Public Law 78-534.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Small Watershed Program provides for cooperation with State  and other public agencies (called project sponsors) in the installation  of planned works of improvement and land treatment measures in  authorized watershed projects. Eligible measures include flood  prevention, water conservation, recreation, agricultural water  management, floodplain easements, municipal and industrial water, and  rural water supply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program, authorized by  Section 216 of Public Law 81-516, 33 U.S.C. 701b-1, and Section 403 of  the Agriculture Credit Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-334, 16 U.S.C. 2203),  as amended by Section 382 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and  Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-127, 110 Stat. 888, 1016). EWP  provides assistance to reduce an imminent threat to life and property  caused by a sudden impairment of a watershed from a natural disaster.  Emergency work includes such measures as removing debris from streams,  stabilizing streambanks, repairing levees, critical area stabilization,  and purchasing floodplain easements. Technical and financial assistance  is available to sponsoring local organizations (units of government,  Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and organizations formed by  State law) for this disaster   recovery work. Sponsors are required to provide the local share of the  costs; obtain real property rights, water rights, and permits; and do  any needed operation and maintenance.</p>
