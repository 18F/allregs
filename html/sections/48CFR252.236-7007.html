After determining the low offeror, an award may be made on any combination of items if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is in the best interest of the Government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Funds are available at the time of award; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The low offeror's price for the combination to be awarded is less than the price offered by any other responsive, responsible offeror.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Example. The amount available is $100,000. Offeror A's base bid and four additives (in the order stated in the list of priorities in the bid Schedule) are $85,000, $10,000, $8,000, $6,000, and $4,000. Offeror B's base bid and four additives are $80,000, $16,000, $9,000, $7,000, and $4,000. Offeror A is the low offeror. The aggregate amount of offeror A's bid for purposes of award would be $99,000, which includes a base bid plus the first and fourth additives. The second and third additives were skipped because each of them would cause the aggregate bid to exceed $100,000.</p><p class="depth2">(End of provision)</p>
