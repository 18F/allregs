                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(6)</em> of this section are met, owners and operators of  sources subject to this subpart shall monitor each heat exchange system  used to cool process equipment in a chemical manufacturing process unit  meeting the conditions of Sec. 63.100 (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this  subpart, except for chemical manufacturing process units meeting the  condition specified in Sec. 63.100(c) of this subpart, according to the  provisions in either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. Whenever a  leak is detected, the owner or operator shall comply with the  requirements in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The heat exchange system is operated with the minimum pressure  on the cooling water side at least 35 kilopascals greater than the  maximum pressure on the process side.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is an intervening cooling fluid, containing less than 5  percent by weight of total hazardous air pollutants listed in table 4 of  this subpart, between the process and the cooling water. This  intervening fluid serves to isolate the cooling water from the process  fluid and the intervening fluid is not sent through a cooling tower or  discharged. For purposes of this section, discharge does not include  emptying for maintenance purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The once-through heat exchange system is subject to a National  Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit with an allowable  discharge limit of 1 part per million or less above influent  concentration or 10 percent or less above influent concentration,  whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The once-through heat exchange system is subject to an NPDES  permit that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requires monitoring of a parameter(s) or condition(s) to detect  a leak of process fluids into cooling water;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specifies or includes the normal range of the parameter or  condition;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Requires monitoring for the parameters selected as leak  indicators no less frequently than monthly for the first six months and  quarterly thereafter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Requires the owner or operator to report and correct leaks to  the cooling water when the parameter or condition exceeds the normal  range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The recirculating heat exchange system is used to cool process  fluids that contain less than 5 percent by weight of total hazardous air  pollutants listed in table 4 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The once-through heat exchange system is used to cool process  fluids that contain less than 5 percent by weight of total hazardous air  pollutants listed in table 9 of subpart G of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(6)</em> of this section. The cooling water shall be monitored for  total hazardous air pollutants, total volatile organic compounds, total  organic carbon, one or more speciated HAP compounds, or other  representative substances that would indicate the presence of a leak in  the heat exchange system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cooling water shall be monitored monthly for the first 6  months and quarterly thereafter to detect leaks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For recirculating heat exchange systems (cooling tower  systems), the monitoring of speciated hazardous air pollutants or total  hazardous air pollutants refers to the hazardous air pollutants listed  in table 4 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For once-through heat exchange systems, the monitoring of  speciated hazardous air pollutants or total hazardous air pollutants  refers to the hazardous air pollutants listed in table 9 of subpart G of  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The concentration of the monitored substance(s) in the cooling  water shall be determined using any EPA-approved method listed in part  136 of this chapter as long as the method is sensitive to concentrations  as low as 10 parts per million and the same method is used for both  entrance and exit samples. Alternative methods may be used upon approval  by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The samples shall be collected either at the entrance and exit  of each heat exchange system or at locations where the cooling water  enters and exits each heat exchanger or any combination of heat  exchangers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For samples taken at the entrance and exit of recirculating heat  exchange systems, the entrance is the point at which the cooling water  leaves the cooling tower prior to being returned to the process  equipment and the exit is the point at which the cooling water is  introduced to the cooling tower after being used to cool the process  fluid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For samples taken at the entrance and exit of once-through heat  exchange systems, the entrance is the point at which the cooling water  enters and the exit is the point at which the cooling water exits the  plant site or chemical manufacturing process units.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For samples taken at the entrance and exit of each heat  exchanger or any combination of heat exchangers in chemical  manufacturing process units, the entrance is the point at which the  cooling water enters the individual heat exchanger or group of heat  exchangers and the exit is the point at which the cooling water exits  the heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A minimum of three sets of samples shall be taken at each  entrance and exit as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The  average entrance and exit concentrations shall then be calculated. The  concentration shall be corrected for the addition of any makeup water or  for any evaporative losses, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A leak is detected if the exit mean concentration is found to be  greater than the entrance mean using a one-sided statistical procedure  at the 0.05 level of significance and the amount by which it is greater  is at least 1 part per million or 10 percent of the entrance mean,  whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em> of this section. Surrogate  indicators that could be used to develop an acceptable monitoring  program are ion specific electrode monitoring, pH, conductivity or other  representative indicators.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the parameter or condition to be monitored and  an explanation of how the selected parameter or condition will reliably  indicate the presence of a leak.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The parameter level(s) or conditions(s) that shall constitute a  leak. This shall be documented by data or calculations showing that the  selected levels or conditions will reliably identify leaks. The  monitoring must be sufficiently sensitive to determine the range of  parameter levels or conditions when the system is not leaking. When the  selected parameter level or condition is outside that range, a leak is  indicated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The monitoring frequency which shall be no less frequent than  monthly for the first 6 months and quarterly thereafter to detect leaks.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The records that will be maintained to document compliance with  the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a substantial leak is identified by methods other than those  described in the monitoring plan and the method(s) specified in the plan  could not detect the leak, the owner or operator shall revise the plan  and document the basis for the changes. The owner or operator shall  complete the revisions to the plan no later than 180 days after  discovery of the leak.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall maintain, at all times, the  monitoring plan that is currently in use. The current plan shall be  maintained on-site, or shall be accessible from a central location by  computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a  request. If the monitoring plan is superseded, the owner or operator  shall retain the most recent superseded plan at least until 5 years from  the date of its creation. The superseded plan shall be retained on-site  (or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that  provides access within two hours after a request) for at least 6 months  after its creation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(2)</em> of this section, except as  provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The leak shall be repaired as soon as practical but not later  than 45 calendar days after the owner or operator receives results of  monitoring tests indicating a leak. The leak shall be repaired unless  the owner or operator demonstrates that the results are due to a  condition other than a leak.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Once the leak has been repaired, the owner or operator shall  confirm that the heat exchange system has been repaired within 7  calendar days of the repair or startup, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(2)</em> of this section shall be determined from the date when the owner  or operator determines that delay of repair is necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a shutdown is expected within the next 2 months, a special  shutdown before that planned shutdown is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of this   section. Documentation of a decision to delay repair shall state the  reasons repair was delayed and shall specify a schedule for completing  the repair as soon as practical.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(B)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The owner or operator shall calculate the potential emissions  from the leaking heat exchanger by multiplying the concentration of  total hazardous air pollutants listed in table 4 of this subpart in the  cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger by the flowrate of the  cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger by the expected duration  of the delay. The owner or operator may calculate potential emissions  using total organic carbon concentration instead of total hazardous air  pollutants listed in table 4 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The owner or operator shall determine emissions from purging and  depressurizing the equipment that will result from the unscheduled  shutdown for the repair.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If repair is delayed for reasons other than those specified in  paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the owner or operator may delay  repair up to a maximum of 120 calendar days. The owner shall demonstrate  that the necessary parts or personnel were not available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(1)(iv)</em> of this  section as specified in Sec. 63.103(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Monitoring data required by this section indicating a leak and  the date when the leak was detected, and if demonstrated not to be a  leak, the basis for that determination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Records of any leaks detected by procedures subject to  paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the date the leak was discovered;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The dates of efforts to repair leaks; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The method or procedure used to confirm repair of a leak and  the date repair was confirmed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reports. If an owner or operator invokes the delay of repair  provisions for a heat exchange system, the following information shall  be submitted in the next semi-annual periodic report required by  Sec. 63.152(c) of subpart G of this part. If the leak remains  unrepaired, the information shall also be submitted in each subsequent  periodic report, until repair of the leak is reported.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator shall report the presence of the leak and  the date that the leak was detected.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator shall report whether or not the leak has  been repaired.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The owner or operator shall report the reason(s) for delay of  repair. If delay of repair is invoked due to the reasons described in  paragraph (e)(2) of this section, documentation of emissions estimates  must also be submitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the leak remains unrepaired, the owner or operator shall  report the expected date of repair.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the leak is repaired, the owner or operator shall report the  date the leak was successfully repaired.
