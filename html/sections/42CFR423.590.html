                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standard redetermination--request for covered drug benefits. (1) If the Part D plan sponsor makes a redetermination that is completely favorable to the enrollee, the Part D plan sponsor must

notify the enrollee in writing of its redetermination (and effectuate it in accordance with Sec. 423.636(a)(1)) as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than 7 calendar days from the date it receives the request for a standard redetermination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Part D plan sponsor makes a redetermination that is completely favorable to the enrollee, the Part D plan sponsor must

(1) If the Part D plan sponsor makes a redetermination that is completely favorable to the enrollee, the Part D plan sponsor must issue its redetermination (and effectuate it in accordance with Sec. 423.636(a)(2)) no later than 7 calendar days from the date it receives the request for redetermination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Part D plan sponsor makes a redetermination that is completely favorable to the enrollee, the Part D plan sponsor must issue its redetermination (and effectuate it in accordance with Sec. 423.636(a)(2)) no later than 7 calendar days from the date it receives the request for redetermination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Part D plan sponsor affirms, in whole or in part, its adverse coverage determination, it must notify the enrollee in writing of its redetermination no later than 7 calendar days from the date it receives the request for redetermination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of failure to meet timeframe for standard redeterminations. If the Part D plan sponsor fails to provide the enrollee with a redetermination within the timeframes specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the failure constitutes an adverse redetermination decision, and the Part D plan sponsor must forward the enrollee's request to the IRE within 24 hours of the expiration of the adjudication timeframe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Expedited redetermination--(1) Timeframe. A Part D plan sponsor that approves a request for expedited redetermination must complete its redetermination and give the enrollee (and the prescribing physician or other prescriber involved, as appropriate), notice of its decision as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires but no later than 72 hours after receiving the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Timeframe.

If the Part D plan sponsor must receive medical information, the Part D plan sponsor must request the necessary information within 24 hours of the initial request for an expedited redetermination. Regardless of whether the Part D plan sponsor requests additional information, the Part D plan sponsor is responsible for meeting the timeframe and notice requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to meet timeframe for expedited redetermination. If the Part D plan sponsor fails to provide the enrollee or the prescribing physician or other prescriber, as appropriate, with the results of its expedited redetermination within the timeframe described in paragraph (d) of this section, the failure constitutes an adverse redetermination decision, and the Part D plan sponsor must forward the enrollee's request to the IRE within 24 hours of the expiration of the adjudication timeframe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Who must conduct the review of an adverse coverage determination.

The physician making the redetermination need not, in all cases, be of the same specialty or subspecialty as the prescribing physician or other prescriber.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Form and content of an adverse redetermination notice. The notice of any adverse determination under paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(2), (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use approved notice language in a readable and understandable form;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State the specific reasons for the denial;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inform the enrollee of his or her right to a reconsideration;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For adverse drug coverage redeterminations, describe both the standard and expedited reconsideration processes, including the enrollee's right to, and conditions for, obtaining an expedited reconsideration and the rest of the appeals process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For adverse payment redeterminations, describe the standard reconsideration process and the rest of the appeals process; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Comply with any other notice requirements specified by CMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Form and content of a completely favorable redetermination notice.
