                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification: Each lot of shelled or cleaned inshell peanuts  intended for human consumption shall be identified by positive lot  identification prior to being shipped or otherwise disposed of. Positive  lot identification (PLI) methods are tailored to the size and  containerization of the lot, by warehouse storage or space requirements,  or, by necessary further movement of the lot prior to certification.  Positive lot identification is established by the Inspection Service and  includes the following methods of identification. For domestic lots and  repackaged import lots, PLI includes PLI stickers, tags or seals applied  to each individual package or container in such a manner that is  acceptable to the Inspection Service and maintains the identity of the  lot. For imported lots, PLI tape may be used to wrap bags or boxes on  pallets, PLI stickers may be used to cover the shrink-wrap overlap,  doors may be sealed to isolate the lot, bags or boxes may be stenciled  with a lot number, or any other means that is acceptable to the  Inspection Service. The crop year or quota year shown on the positive  lot identification tags shall be the year in which the peanuts in the  lot were produced domestically or imported into the U.S., as  appropriate. All lots of shelled and cleaned-inshell peanuts shall be  handled, stored, and shipped under positive lot identification  procedures, except those lots which are reconstituted and/or commingled  at the request of the buyer: Provided, That the reconstituted or  commingled lots were previously positive lot identified and certified as  meeting the outgoing standards of Sec. 996.31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sampling and testing shelled peanuts for outgoing Inspection:  Prior to shipment, the following sampling and inspection procedures  shall be conducted on each lot of shelled peanuts intended for human  consumption. The lot size of shelled or cleaned-inshell peanuts  presented for outgoing inspection in bags or bulk shall not exceed  200,000 pounds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each handler or importer shall cause appropriate samples, based  on a sampling plan approved by the Inspection Service, of each lot of  shelled peanuts intended for human consumption to be drawn by the  Inspection Service. The gross amount of peanuts drawn shall be large  enough to provide for a grade analysis, for a grading check-sample, and  for three 48-pound samples for aflatoxin chemical analysis. The three  48-pound samples shall be designated by the Inspection Service as  ``Sample 1,'' ``Sample 2,'' and ``Sample 3'' and each sample shall be  placed in a suitable container and positive lot identified by means  acceptable to the Inspection Service. Sample 1 may be prepared for  immediate testing or Sample 1, Sample 2, and Sample 3 may be returned to  the handler or importer for testing at a later date. Imported peanuts  shall be labeled ``Sample 1IMP,'' ``Sample 2IMP,'' and ``Sample 3IMP''  and handled accordingly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before shipment of a lot of shelled peanuts to a buyer, the  handler or importer shall cause Sample 1 to be ground by the Inspection  Service, a USDA laboratory or a USDA-approved laboratory, in a  ``subsampling mill.'' The resultant ground subsample from Sample 1 shall  be of a size specified by the Inspection Service and shall be designated  as ``Subsample 1-AB'' and at the handler's, importer's or buyer's  option, a second subsample may also be extracted from Sample 1. It shall  be designated as ``Subsample 1-CD.'' Subsample 1-CD may be sent as  requested by the handler or buyer, for aflatoxin assay, to a USDA  laboratory or USDA-approved laboratory that can provide analyses results  on such samples in 36 hours. The cost of sampling and testing Subsample  1-CD shall be for the account of the applicant. Subsample 1-AB shall be  analyzed only in a USDA laboratory or USDA-approved laboratory. Both  Subsamples 1-AB and 1-CD shall be accompanied by a notice of sampling or  grade certificate, signed by the inspector, containing, at least,  identifying information as to the handler or importer, the buyer, if  known, and the positive lot identification of the shelled peanuts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The samples designated as Sample 2 and Sample 3 shall be held as  aflatoxin check-samples by the Inspection Service or the handler or  importer and shall not be included in the shipment to the buyer until  the analyses results from Sample 1 are known.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon call from the laboratory, the handler or importer shall  cause Sample 2 to be ground by the Inspection Service, USDA or USDA- approved laboratory in a ``subsampling mill.'' The resultant ground  subsample from Sample 2 shall be of a size specified by the Inspection  Service and it shall be designated as ``Subsample 2-AB.'' Upon call from  the laboratory, the handler shall cause Sample 3 to be ground by the  Inspection Service, USDA or USDA-approved laboratory in a ``subsampling  mill.'' The resultant ground subsample from Sample 3 shall be of a size  specified by Inspection Service and shall be designated as ``Subsample  3-AB.'' ``Subsamples 2-AB and 3-AB'' shall be analyzed only in a USDA  laboratory or a USDA-approved laboratory and each shall be accompanied  by a notice of sampling. The results of each assay shall be reported by  the laboratory to the handler and to USDA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Handlers and importers may make arrangements for required  inspection and certification by contacting the Inspection Service office  closest to where the peanuts will be made available for sampling. For  questions regarding inspection services, a list of Federal or Federal- State Inspection Service offices, or for further assistance, handlers  and importers may contact: Fresh Products Branch, Fruit and Vegetable  Programs, AMS, USDA, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., Room 2049-S, (STOP  0240), Washington, DC, 20250-0240; Telephone: (202) 720-5870; Fax: (202)  720-0393.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Handlers and importers may make arrangements for required  chemical analysis for aflatoxin content at the nearest USDA or USDA- approved laboratory. For further information concerning chemical  analysis and a list of laboratories authorized to conduct such analysis  contact: Dr. Robert Epstein, Deputy Administrator, Science and  Technology Programs, AMS, USDA, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW. STOP 0270,  Washington, DC 20250-0270; Telephone (202) 720-5231; Fax (202) 720-6496.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeal inspections. Any ``holder of the title'' to any lot of  peanuts may request an appeal inspection if it is believed that the  original aflatoxin test results were in error. Appeal inspections would  be conducted in accordance with Federal or Federal-State inspection  procedures for milled peanuts. The aflatoxin appeal sample would be  drawn by Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service officials and the  appeal analysis would be conducted by USDA or USDA-approved  laboratories. Any financially interested person may request an appeal  inspection if it is believed that the original quality inspection is in  error. Quality appeals would be conducted by Federal or Federal-State  Inspection Service inspectors in accordance with the Federal or Federal- State inspection procedures for milled peanuts. The person requesting  the appeal inspection would pay the cost of such appeals. The appeal  inspection results shall be issued to the person requesting the appeal  inspection and a copy shall be mailed to USDA or its agent.
