The automatic speed signal required for a monitoring system must be obtained from the ship's speed indicating device by means of a repeater signal. The speed information used may be either speed over the ground or speed through the water, depending upon the speed measuring equipment installed on board.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (d): See ``Recommendation on Performance Standards for Devices to Indicate Speed and Distance,'' Annex to resolution A.824(19) as amended by resolution MSC.96(72).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Ship position indicating device.

Alternative arrangements that ensure the automatic and continuous reception of time and date information from an external source may be approved by the Marine Safety Center.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the event of power failure the processor must retain its memory in respect to computation of the total
