                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Investigation. The Secretary will investigate all complaints by  a mortgagor concerning late payments. If the Secretary determines that  the mortgagee is unable or unwilling to make all payments required under  the mortgage, including late charges, the Secretary shall pay such  payments and late charges to the mortgagor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reimbursement or assignment. The Secretary may demand that  within 30 days from the demand, the mortgagee reimburse the Secretary,  with interest from the date of payment by the Secretary, or assign the  insured mortgage to the Secretary. Interest shall be paid at a rate set  in conformity with the Treasury Financial Manual. If the mortgagee  complies with the reimbursement demand, then the contract of insurance  shall not be affected. If the mortgagee complies by assigning the  mortgage for record within 30 days of the demand, then the Secretary  shall pay an insurance claim as provided in Sec. 206.129(e)(3) and  assume all responsibilities of the mortgagee under the first mortgage.  If the mortgagee fails to comply with the demand within 30 days, the  contract of insurance will terminate as provided in Sec. 206.133(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, all payments to the mortgagor by the  Secretary will be secured by the second mortgage, if any. Payments will  be due and payable in the same manner as under the insured first  mortgage. The liability of the mortgagor under the first mortgage shall  be limited to payments actually made by the mortgagee to or on behalf of  the mortgagor (including MIP), and shall exclude accrued interest,  whether or not it has been included in the mortgage balance, and shared  appreciation, if any. Interest will stop accruing on the first mortgage  when the Secretary begins to make payments under the second mortgage.  The first mortgage will not be due and payable until the second mortgage  is due and payable.
