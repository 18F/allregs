                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An individual requesting disclosure of a record which contains medical or psychological information may name a medical doctor or other person to act as his agent as described in Sec. 701.310(a). Records containing medical or psychological information may be disclosed to that agent rather than to the individual at the individual's request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the individual has not named a medical doctor as agent, the Council may determine, after consultation with a medical doctor, that disclosure of the information would have an adverse effect on the requester. The Council may then disclose that information to a medical doctor specified by the individual, rather than to that individual, either in person or by mail.
