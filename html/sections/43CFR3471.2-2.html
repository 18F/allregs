The transferee shall be given a reasonable period of time within which to suggest any stipulations necessary for the protection of existing surface improvements or uses to be included in the license or lease and state the supporting facts, or to file any objections to its issuance and state the supporting facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Opposition by the state or local entity is not a bar to issuance of the license to mine or lease for the reserved minerals in the lands.
