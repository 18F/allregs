                                Sec. 1.863-9  Source of income derived from communications activity
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Income of a United States or a foreign person  derived from each type of communications activity, as defined in  paragraph (h)(3) of this section, is sourced under the rules of this  section, notwithstanding any other provision including sections 861,  862, 863, and 865. Notwithstanding that a communications activity would  qualify as space or ocean activity under section 863(d) and the  regulations thereunder, the source of income derived from such  communications activity is determined under this section, and not under  section 863(d) and the regulations thereunder, except to the extent  provided in Sec. 1.863-8(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Source of international communications income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> International  communications income derived by a United States person. Income derived  from international communications activity (international communications  income) by a United States person is one-half from sources within the  United States and one-half from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> International communications income derived by foreign persons-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. International communications income derived by a person  other than a United States person is, except as otherwise provided in  this paragraph (b)(2), wholly from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> International communications income derived by a controlled  foreign corporation. International communications income derived by a  controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957 (CFC)  is one-half from sources within the United States and one-half from  sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> International communications income derived by foreign persons  with a fixed place of business in the United States. International  communications income derived by a foreign person, other than a CFC,  that is attributable to an office or other fixed place of business of  the foreign person in the United States is from sources within the  United States. The principles of section 864(c)(5) apply in determining  whether a foreign person has an office or fixed   place of business in the United States. See Sec. 1.864-7. International  communications income is attributable to an office or other fixed place  of business to the extent of functions performed, resources employed, or  risks assumed by the office or other fixed place of business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> International communications income derived by foreign persons  engaged in a trade or business within the United States. International  communications income derived by a foreign person (other than a CFC)  engaged in a trade or business within the United States is income from  sources within the United States to the extent the income, based on all  the facts and circumstances, is attributable to functions performed,  resources employed, or risks assumed within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Source of U.S. communications income. Income derived by a United  States or foreign person from U.S. communications activity is from  sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Source of foreign communications income. Income derived by a  United States or foreign person from foreign communications activity is  from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Source of space/ocean communications income. The source of  income derived by a United States or foreign person from space/ocean  communications activity is determined under section 863(d) and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Source of communications income when taxpayer cannot establish  the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit the  communication. Income derived by a United States or foreign person from  communications activity, when the taxpayer cannot establish the two  points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit the communication  as required in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, is from sources  within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Taxable income. When a taxpayer allocates gross income under  paragraph (b)(2)(iii), (b)(2)(iv), or (h)(1)(ii) of this section, the  taxpayer must allocate expenses, losses, and other deductions as  prescribed in Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T to the class or  classes of gross income that include the income so allocated in each  case. A taxpayer must then apply the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through  1.861-14T properly to apportion amounts of expenses, losses, and other  deductions so allocated to such gross income between gross income from  sources within the United States and gross income from sources without  the United States. For amounts of expenses, losses, and other deductions  allocated to gross income derived from international communications  activity, when the source of income is determined under the 50/50 method  of paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section, taxpayers generally  must apportion expenses, losses, and other deductions between sources  within the United States and sources without the United States pro rata  based on the relative amounts of gross income from sources within the  United States and gross income from sources without the United States.  However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to research and  experimental expenditures qualifying under Sec. 1.861-17, which are to  be allocated and apportioned under the rules of that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Communications activity and income derived from communications  activity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Communications activity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. For purposes of  this part, communications activity consists solely of the delivery by  transmission of communications or data (communications). Delivery of  communications other than by transmission (for example, by delivery of  physical packages and letters) is not communications activity within the  meaning of this section. Communications activity also includes the  provision of capacity to transmit communications. Provision of content  or any other additional service provided along with, or in connection  with, a non-de minimis communications activity must be treated as a  separate non-communications activity unless de minimis. Communications  activity or non-communications activity will be treated as de minimis to  the extent, based on the facts and circumstances, the value attributable  to such activity is de minimis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Separate transaction. To the extent that a taxpayer's  transaction consists in part of non-de minimis communications activity  and in part of non-de minimis non-communications activity, each such  part of the transaction must   be treated as a separate transaction. Gross income is allocated to each  such communications activity transaction and non-communications activity  transaction to the extent the income, based on all the facts and  circumstances, is attributable to functions performed, resources  employed, or risks assumed in each such activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Income derived from communications activity. Income derived from  communications activity (communications income) is income derived from  the delivery by transmission of communications, including income derived  from the provision of capacity to transmit communications. Income may be  considered derived from a communications activity even if the taxpayer  itself does not perform the transmission function, but in all cases, the  taxpayer derives communications income only if the taxpayer is paid to  transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determining the type of communications activity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Whether income is derived from international communications activity,  U.S. communications activity, foreign communications activity, or space/ ocean communications activity is determined by identifying the two  points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit the communication.  The taxpayer must establish the two points between which the taxpayer is  paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communication.  Whether the taxpayer contracts out part or all of the transmission  function is not relevant. A taxpayer may satisfy the requirement that  the taxpayer establish the two points between which the taxpayer is paid  to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communication by  using any consistently applied reasonable method to establish one or  both endpoints. In evaluating the reasonableness of such method,  consideration will be given to all the facts and circumstances,  including whether the endpoints would otherwise be identifiable absent  this reasonable method provision and the reliability of the data.  Depending on the facts and circumstances, methods based on, for example,  records of port or transport charges, customer billing records, a  satellite footprint, or records of termination fees made pursuant to an  international settlement agreement may be reasonable. In addition,  practices used by taxpayers to classify or categorize certain  communications activity in connection with preparation of statements and  analyses for the use of management, creditors, minority shareholders,  joint ventures, or other parties or governmental agencies in interest  may be reliable indicators of the reasonableness of the method chosen,  but need not be accorded conclusive weight by the Commissioner. In all  cases, the method chosen to establish the two points between which the  taxpayer is paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the  communication must be supported by sufficient documentation to permit  verification by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income derived from international communications activity.  Income derived by a taxpayer from international communications activity  (international communications income) is income derived from  communications activity, as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section,  when the taxpayer is paid to transmit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Between a point in the United States and a point in a foreign  country (or a possession of the United States); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Foreign-originating communications (communications with a  beginning point in a foreign country or a possession of the United  States) from a point in space or international water to a point in the  United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Income derived from U.S. communications activity. Income  derived by a taxpayer from U.S. communications activity (U.S.  communications income) is income derived from communications activity,  as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, when the taxpayer is  paid to transmit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Between two points in the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Income derived from foreign communications activity. Income  derived by a taxpayer from foreign communications activity (foreign  communications income)   is income derived from communications activity, as defined in paragraph  (h)(2) of this section, when the taxpayer is paid to transmit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Between two points in a foreign country or countries (or a  possession or possessions of the United States);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Between a foreign country and a possession of the United States;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Between a foreign country (or a possession of the United States)  and a point in space or international water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Income derived from space/ocean communications activity. Income  derived by a taxpayer from space/ocean communications activity (space/ ocean communications income) is income derived from communications  activity, as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, when the  taxpayer is paid to transmit between a point in space or international  water and another point in space or international water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Treatment of partnerships. This section is applied at the  partner level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. D provides its customers in various foreign  countries with access to its data base, which contains information on  certain individuals' health care insurance coverage. Customer C obtains  access to D's data base by placing a call to D's telephone number.  Assume that C's telephone service, used to access D's data base, is  provided by a third party, and that D assumes no responsibility for the  transmission of the information via telephone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. D is not paid to transmit communications and does not  derive income from communications activity within the meaning of  paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Rather, D derives income from  provision of content or provision of services to its customers.  Therefore, the rules of this section do not apply to determine the  source of D's income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. TC, a local telephone  company, receives an access fee from an international carrier for  picking up a call from a local telephone customer and delivering the  call to a U.S. point of presence (POP) of the international carrier. The  international carrier picks up the call from its U.S. POP and delivers  the call to a foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. TC is not paid to carry the transmission between the  United States and a foreign country. TC is paid to transmit a  communication between two points in the United States. TC derives U.S.  communications income as defined in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this  section, which is sourced under paragraph (c) of this section as U.S.  source income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. TC, a domestic corporation, owns  an underwater fiber optic cable. Pursuant to contracts, TC makes  available to its customers capacity to transmit communications via the  cable. TC's customers then solicit telephone customers and arrange to  transmit the telephone customers' calls. The cable runs in part through  U.S. waters, in part through international waters, and in part through  foreign country waters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section because TC is paid to  make available capacity to transmit communications between the United  States and a foreign country. Because TC is a United States person, TC's  international communications income is sourced under paragraph (b)(1) of  this section as one-half from sources within the United States and one- half from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. S, a United States person, owns  satellites in orbit and uplink facilities in Country X, a foreign  country. B, a resident of Country X, pays S to deliver B's programming  from S's uplink facility, located in Country X, to a downlink facility  in the United States owned by C, a customer of B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section because S is paid to transmit the  communications between a beginning point in a foreign country and an  endpoint in the United States. Because S is a United States person, the  source of S's international communications income is determined under  paragraph (b)(1) of this section as one-half from sources within the  United States and one-half from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. TC is paid to transmit communications from Toronto,  Canada, to Paris, France. TC transmits the communications from Toronto  to New York. TC pays another communications company, IC, to transmit the  communications from New York to Paris.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of  this section because IC is paid to transmit the communications between a  point in the United States and a point in a foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. TC is paid to transmit a call between two points in  the United States, but routes the call through Canada.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, the  character of income derived from communications activity is determined  by the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit, and  bears the risk of transmitting, the communications, without regard to  the path of the transmission between those two points. Thus, under  paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section, TC derives income from U.S.  communications activity because it is paid to transmit the  communications between two U.S. points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Under an international settlement agreement, G, a Country X  international carrier, pays T to receive all calls originating in  Country X that are bound for the United States and to terminate such  calls in the United States. Due to Country X legal restrictions, the  international settlement agreement specifies that G carries the  transmission to a point outside the territory of Country X and that T  carries the foreign-originating transmission from such point to the  destined point in the United States. T, in turn, contracts out with  another communications company, S, to transmit the U.S. portion of the  communications. Tracing and identifying the endpoints of each  transmission is not possible or practical. T does, however, keep records  of termination fees received from G for terminating the foreign- originating calls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this section, T  derives income from international communications. If, based on all the  facts and circumstances, T could reasonably trace and identify the  endpoints, then T would have to directly establish that each call  originated in a foreign country. Assuming T is able to do so, the rest  of the analysis in this Example 7 remains the same. Under paragraph  (h)(3)(iii) of this section, S derives income from U.S. communications  activity because S is paid to transmit the communications between two  U.S. points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. S purchases capacity from TC to transmit telephone calls. S  sells prepaid telephone calling cards that give customers access to TC's  telephone lines for a certain number of minutes. Assume that S cannot  establish the endpoints of its customers' telephone calls, even under  the reasonable method rule of paragraph (h)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. S derives communications income as defined in  paragraph (h)(2) of this section because S makes capacity to transmit  communications available to its customers. In this case, S cannot  establish the two points between which the communications are  transmitted. Therefore, S's communications income is U.S. source income,  as provided by paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>Facts. B provides both domestic and international long  distance services in a calling plan for a limited number of minutes for  a set amount each month. Tracing and identifying the endpoints of each  transmission is not possible or practical. B is, however, able to  establish that the calling plan generated $10,000 of revenue for 25,000  minutes based on reports derived from customer billing records. Based on  minutes of use data in these reports, B is able to establish that of the  total 25,000 minutes, 60 percent or 15,000 minutes were for U.S. long  distance calls and 40 percent or 10,000 minutes were for international  calls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. B derives communications income as defined in  paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Based on all the facts and  circumstances, B can establish the two points between which B is paid to  transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communications using a  reasonable method to establish the endpoints, assuming that this method  is consistently applied. In this case, B can reasonably establish that  60 percent of the income derived from the long distance calling plan is  U.S. communications income and 40 percent is international  communications income based on the minutes of use data derived from  customer billing records   to establish the endpoints of the communications. If, based on all the  facts and circumstances, B could reasonably trace and identify the  endpoints, then B would have to directly identify the endpoints between  which B is paid to transmit the communications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. D operates  satellites which are designed to transmit signals through two separate  ranges of signal frequencies (bands). Due to technological limitations,  requirements, and practicalities, one band is designed to only transmit  signals within the United States. The other band is designed to transmit  signals between foreign countries and the United States. D cannot trace  and identify the endpoints of each individual transmission. D does,  however, track the total transmission through each band and the total  income derived from transmitting signals through each band.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. D derives communications income as defined in  paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Based on all the facts and  circumstances, D can establish the two points between which D is paid to  transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communications using a  reasonable method to establish endpoints, assuming that this method is  consistently applied. In this case, D can reasonably establish that  income derived from transmissions through the first band is U.S.  communications income and income derived from transmissions through the  second band is international communications income based on the design  of the bands to establish the endpoints of the communications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X  provides its customer, C, with a virtual private network (VPN) so that  C's U.S. headquarter office can connect and communicate with offices in  the United States, Country X, Country Y, and Country Z. Assume that the  VPN is only for communications with the U.S. headquarter office. X  cannot trace and identify the endpoints of each transmission. C pays X a  set amount each month for the entire service, regardless of the  magnitude of the usage or the geographic points between which C uses the  service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. X derives communications income as defined in  paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Based on the facts and circumstances,  X can establish the two points between which X is paid to transmit, and  bears the risk of transmitting, the communications using a reasonable  method to establish endpoints, assuming that this method is consistently  applied. In this case, X can reasonably establish that one-fourth of the  income derived from the VPN service is U.S. communications income and  three-fourths is international communications income based on the  location of the VPN ports to establish the endpoints of the  communications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. B,  a domestic corporation, is an Internet service provider. B charges its  customer, C, a monthly lump sum for Internet access. C accesses the  Internet via a telephone call, initiated by the modem of C's personal  computer, to one of B's control centers, which serves as C's portal to  the Internet. B transmits data sent by C from B's control center in  France to a recipient in England, over the Internet. B does not maintain  records as to the beginning and endpoints of the transmission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. B derives communications income as defined in  paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The source of B's communications  income is determined under paragraph (f) of this section as income from  sources within the United States because B cannot establish the two  points between which it is paid to transmit the communications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The  same facts as in Example 12.</p><p class="depth0">Assume in addition that B replicates frequently requested sites on  B's own servers, solely to speed up response time. Assume that B's  replication of frequently requested sites would be considered a de  minimis non-communications activity under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. On these facts, because B's replication of frequently  requested sites would be considered a de minimis non-communications  activity, B is not required to treat the replication activity as a  separate non-communications activity transaction under paragraph (h)(1)  of this section. B derives communications income under paragraph (h)(2)  of this section. The character and source of B's communications income  are determined by demonstrating the points between which B is paid to  transmit the communications, under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A, a domestic  corporation, offers customers local and long distance phone service,  video, and Internet services. Customers pay a flat monthly fee plus 10  cents a minute for all long-distance calls, including international  calls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, A would determine the source of such income  under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If A cannot establish the points  between which it is paid to transmit communications, as required by  paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, A's communications income is from  sources within the United States, as provided by paragraph (f) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. B, a domestic corporation, is paid  by D, a cable system operator in Foreign Country, to provide television  programs and to transmit the television programs to Foreign Country.  Using its own satellite transponder, B transmits the television programs  from the United States to downlink facilities owned by D in Foreign  Country. D receives the transmission, unscrambles the signals, and  distributes the broadcast to D's customers in Foreign Country. Assume  that B's provision of television programs is a non-de minimis non- communications activity, and that B's transmission of television  programs is a non-de minimis communications activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section because B is paid to transmit communications  from the United States to a foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. STS provides satellite capacity to B, a broadcaster located in  Australia. B beams programming from Australia to the satellite. S's  satellite picks the communications up in space and beams the programming  over a footprint covering Southeast Asia.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. S derives communications income as defined in  paragraph (h)(2) of this section. S's income is characterized as foreign  communications income under paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section because  S picks up the communication in space, and beams it to a footprint  entirely covering a foreign area. Under paragraph (d) of this section,  S's foreign communications income is from sources without the United  States. If S were beaming the programming over a satellite footprint  that covered area both in the United States and outside the United  States, S would be required to allocate the income derived from the  different types of communications activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Reporting and documentation requirements--(1) In general. A  taxpayer making an allocation of gross income under paragraph  (b)(2)(iii), (b)(2)(iv), or (h)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section must satisfy the  requirements in paragraphs (k)(2), (3), and (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Required documentation. In all cases, a taxpayer must prepare  and maintain documentation in existence when its return is filed  regarding the allocation of gross income, and allocation and  apportionment of expenses, losses, and other deductions, the  methodologies used, and the circumstances justifying use of those  methodologies. The taxpayer must make available such documentation  within 30 days upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Access to software. If the taxpayer or any third party used any  computer software, within the meaning of section 7612(d), to allocate  gross income, or to allocate or apportion expenses, losses, and other  deductions, the taxpayer must make available upon request--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any computer software executable code, within the meaning of  section 7612(d), used for such purposes, including an executable copy of  the version of the software used in the preparation of the taxpayer's  return (including any plug-ins, supplements, etc.) and a copy of all  related electronic data files. Thus, if software subsequently is  upgraded or supplemented, a separate executable copy of the version used  in preparing the taxpayer's return must be retained;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any related computer software source code, within the meaning  of section 7612(d), acquired or developed by the taxpayer or a related  person, or primarily for internal use by the taxpayer or such person  rather than for commercial distribution; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of any spreadsheet software or similar software,  any formulae or links to supporting worksheets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use of allocation methodology. In general, when a taxpayer  allocates gross income under paragraph (b)(2)(iii), (b)(2)(iv), or  (h)(1)(ii) of this section, it does so by making the allocation on a  timely filed original return (including extensions). However, a taxpayer  will be permitted to make   changes to such allocations made on its original return with respect to  any taxable year for which the statute of limitations has not closed as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a taxpayer that has made a change to such  allocations prior to the opening conference for the audit of the taxable  year to which the allocation relates or who makes such a change within  90 days of such opening conference, if the IRS issues a written  information document request asking the taxpayer to provide the  documents and such other information described in paragraphs (k)(2) and  (3) of this section with respect to the changed allocations and the  taxpayer complies with such request within 30 days of the request, then  the IRS will complete its examination, if any, with respect to the  allocations for that year as part of the current examination cycle. If  the taxpayer does not provide the documents and information described in  paragraphs (k)(2) and (3) of this section within 30 days of the request,  then the procedures described in paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section  shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the taxpayer changes such allocations more than 90 days  after the opening conference for the audit of the taxable year to which  the allocations relate or the taxpayer does not provide the documents  and information with respect to the changed allocations as requested in  accordance with paragraphs (k)(2) and (3) of this section, then the IRS  will, in a separate cycle, determine whether an examination of the  taxpayer's allocations is warranted and complete any such examination.  The separate cycle will be worked as resources are available and may not  have the same estimated completion date as the other issues under  examination for the taxable year. The IRS may ask the taxpayer to extend  the statute of limitations on assessment and collection for the taxable  year to permit examination of the taxpayer's method of allocation,  including an extension limited, where appropriate, to the taxpayer's  method of allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Effective date. This section applies to taxable years beginning  on or after December 27, 2006.  [T.D. 9305, 71 FR 77603, Dec. 27, 2006; 72 FR 3490, Jan. 25, 2007]</p>
