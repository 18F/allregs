                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Establishment of FSS account--(1) General. The PHA shall deposit the FSS account funds of all families participating in the PHA's FSS program into a single depository account. The PHA must deposit the FSS account funds in one or more of the HUD-approved investments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Accounting for FSS account funds--(i) Accounting records. The total of the combined FSS account funds will be supported in the PHA accounting records by a subsidiary ledger showing the balance applicable to each FSS family. During the term of the contract of participation, the PHA shall credit periodically, but not less than annually, to each family's FSS account, the amount of the FSS credit determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Proration of investment income. The investment income for funds in the FSS account will be prorated and credited to each family's FSS account based on the balance in each family's FSS account at the end of the period for which the investment income is credited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reduction of amounts due by FSS family. If the FSS family has not paid the family contribution towards rent, or other amounts, if any, due under the public housing or section 8-assisted lease, the balance in the family's FSS account shall be reduced by that amount (as reported by the owner to the PHA in the Section 8 FSS program) before prorating the interest income. If the FSS family has fraudulently under-reported income, the amount credited to the FSS account will be based on the income amounts originally reported by the FSS family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reporting on FSS account. Each PHA will be required to make a report, at least once annually, to each FSS family on the status of the family's FSS account. At a minimum, the report will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The balance at the beginning of the reporting period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the family's rent payment that was credited to the FSS account, during the reporting period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any deductions made from the account for amounts due the PHA before interest is distributed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The amount of interest earned on the account during the year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The total in the account at the end of the reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> FSS credit--(1) Computation of amount. For purposes of determining the FSS credit, ``family rent'' is: for the public housing program, the total tenant payment as defined in 24 CFR

subpart F of 24 CFR part 5; for the rental certificate program, the total tenant payment as defined in 24 CFR subpart F of 24 CFR part 5; and for the rental voucher program, 30 percent of adjusted monthly income. The FSS credit shall be computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For FSS families who are very low-income families, the FSS credit shall be the amount which is the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Thirty percent of current monthly adjusted income less the family rent, which is obtained by disregarding any increases in earned income (as defined in Sec. 984.103) from the effective date of the contract of participation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The current family rent less the family rent at the time of the effective date of the contract of participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For FSS families who are low-income families but not very low-income families, the FSS credit shall be the amount determined according to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, but which shall not exceed the amount computed for 50 percent of median income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ineligibility for FSS credit. FSS families who are not low-income families shall not be entitled to any FSS credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cessation of FSS credit. The PHA shall not make any additional credits to the FSS family's FSS account when the FSS family has completed the contract of participation, as defined in Sec. 984.303(g), or when the contract of participation is terminated or otherwise nullified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disbursement of FSS account funds--(1) General. The amount in an FSS account, in excess of any amount owed to the PHA by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, shall be paid to the head of the FSS family when the contract of participation has been completed as provided in Sec. 984.303(g), and if, at the time of contract completion, the head of the FSS family submits to the PHA a certification, as defined in Sec. 984.103, that, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, no member of the FSS family is a recipient of welfare assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disbursement before expiration of contract term. (i) If the PHA determines that the FSS family has fulfilled its obligations under the contract of participation before the expiration of the contract term, and the head of the FSS family submits a certification that, to the best of his or her knowledge, no member of the FSS family is a recipient of welfare assistance, the amount in the family's FSS account, in excess of any amount owed to the PHA by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, shall be paid to the head of the FSS family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the PHA determines that the FSS family has fulfilled certain interim goals established in the contract of participation and needs a portion of the FSS account funds for purposes consistent with the contract of participation, such as completion of higher education (i.e., college, graduate school), or job training, or to meet start-up expenses involved in creation of a small business, the PHA may, at the PHA's sole option, disburse a portion of the funds from the family's FSS account to assist the family meet those expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Verification of family certification. Before disbursement of the FSS account funds to the family, the PHA may verify that the FSS family is no longer a recipient of welfare assistance by requesting copies of any documents which may indicate whether the family is receiving any welfare assistance, and contacting welfare agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Succession to FSS account. If the head of the FSS family ceases to reside with other family members in the public housing or the Section 8-assisted unit, the remaining members of the FSS family, after consultation with the PHA, shall have the right to designate another family member to receive the funds in accordance with paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Use of FSS account funds for homeownership. A public housing FSS family may use its FSS account funds for the purchase of a home, including the purchase of a home under one of HUD's homeownership programs, or other Federal, State, or local homeownership programs unless such use is prohibited by the statute or regulations governing the particular homeownership program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Forfeiture of FSS account funds--(1) Conditions for forfeiture. Amounts in the FSS account shall be forfeited upon the occurrence of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contract of participation is terminated, as provided in Sec. 984.303(e) or Sec. 984.303(h); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contract of participation is completed by the family, as provided in Sec. 984.303(g), but the FSS family is receiving welfare assistance at the time of expiration of the term of the contract of participation, including any extension thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of forfeited FSS account funds--(i) Public housing FSS program. FSS account funds forfeited by the FSS family will be credited to the PHA's operating reserves and counted as other income in the calculation of the PFS operating subsidy eligibility for the next budget year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 8 FSS program. FSS account funds forfeited by the FSS family will be treated as program receipts for payment of program expenses under the PHA budget for the applicable Section 8 program, and shall be used in accordance with HUD requirements governing the use of program receipts.
