                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. Under the authority of section 110 of the Act, a pension benefit plan that meets the requirements of

paragraph (b) of this section is exempted from the provisions of the Act that require filing with the Secretary an annual report and furnishing a summary annual report to participants and beneficiaries receiving benefits. Such plans may use a simplified method of reporting and disclosure to comply with the requirement to furnish a summary plan description to participants and beneficiaries receiving benefits, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In lieu of filing an annual report with the Secretary or distributing a summary annual report, a filing is made of Report Form LM-2 or LM-3, pursuant to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) and regulations thereunder, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In lieu of a summary plan description, the employee organization constitution or bylaws may be furnished in accordance with Sec. 2520.104b-2 to participants and beneficiaries together with any supplement to such document necessary to meet the requirements of Secs. 2520.102-2 and 2520.102-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. This exemption is available only to pension benefit plans maintained by an employee organization, as that term is defined in section 3(4) of the Act, paid for out of the employee organization's general assets, which are derived wholly or partly from membership dues, and which cover employee organization members and their beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitations. This exemption does not exempt the administrator from any other requirement of part 1 of title I of the Act.
