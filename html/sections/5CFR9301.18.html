                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>. Individuals desiring assistance in the preparation  of their request for review should contact the Privacy Officer at the  address provided herein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The request for review should contain a brief description of the  record involved or in lieu thereof, copies of the correspondence from  SIGAR in which the request to amend was denied, and also should state  the reasons why the individual believes that the disputed information  should be amended. The request for review should make reference to the  information furnished by the individual in support of his claim and the  reasons, as required by Sec. 9301.17, set forth by SIGAR in its decision  denying the amendment. In order to avoid the unnecessary retention of  personal information, SIGAR reserves the right to dispose of the  material concerning the request to amend a record if no request for  review in accordance with this section is received by SIGAR within 180  days of the mailing by SIGAR of its decision upon an initial request. A  request for review received after the 180 day period may, at the  discretion of the Privacy Officer, be treated as an initial request to  amend a record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The request for review should be addressed to the Appellate  Authority, Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan  Reconstruction, 2530 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202. As there may be  delays in mail delivery, it is advisable to send the request via  facsimile to (703) 601-3804 or by email to sigar.pentagon.gen- coun.mbx.privacy@mail.mil.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Final determinations on requests for reviews within SIGAR will  be made by the Appellate Authority. Additional information may be  requested by the Appellate Authority from the person requesting a review  if necessary to make a determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Appellate Authority will inform the person making the  request in writing of the decision on the request for review within 30  days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal Federal holidays) from the  date of receipt by SIGAR of the individual's request for review, unless  the Appellate Authority extends the 30 day period for good cause. The  extension and the reasons therefore will be sent by SIGAR to the  individual within the initial 30 day period. Included in the notice of a  decision being reviewed, if the decision does not grant in full the  request for review, will be a description of the steps the individual  may take to obtain judicial review of such a decision, and a statement  that the individual may file a concise statement with SIGAR setting  forth the individual's reasons for his disagreement with the decision  upon the request for review. The SIGAR Privacy Officer has the authority  to determine the ``conciseness'' of the statement, taking into account  the scope of the disagreement and the complexity of the issues. Upon the  filing of a proper concise statement by the individual, any subsequent  disclosure of the information in dispute will have the information in  dispute clearly noted and a copy of the concise statement furnished,  setting forth its reasons for not making the requested changes, if SIGAR  chooses to file such a statement. A copy of the individual's statement,  and if it chooses, SIGAR's statement, will be sent to any prior  transferee of the disputed information who is listed on the accounting  required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(c).</p>
