                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any application for inspection in accordance with this part may be denied or refused in accordance with the rules of practice in part 500 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Any applicant for inspection at an establishment where the operations thereof may result in any discharge into the navigable waters of the United States is required by subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, to provide the Administrator with a certification as prescribed in said subsection that there is reasonable assurance that such activity will be conducted in a manner which will not violate the applicable water quality standards. No grant of inspection can be issued after April 3, 1970 (the date of enactment of the Water Quality Improvement Act), unless such certification has been obtained, or is waived because of failure or refusal of the State, interstate agency, or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to act on a request for certification within 1 year after receipt of such request. Further, upon receipt of an application for inspection and a certification as required by subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Administrator (as defined in Sec. 381.1) is required by paragraph (2) of said subsection to notify the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for proceedings in accordance with that paragraph. No grant of inspection can be made until the requirements of said paragraph (2) have been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any applicant for inspection at an establishment where the operations thereof may result in any discharge into the navigable waters of the United States is required by subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, to provide the Administrator with a certification as prescribed in said subsection that there is reasonable assurance that such activity will be conducted in a manner which will not violate the applicable water quality standards.

Failure to obtain such certification or to meet the other requirements of subsection 21(b) prior to April 3, 1973, will result in the termination of inspection at such facilities on that date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Further, any application for inspection pending on April 3, 1970, and granted within 1 year thereafter shall not require certification for 1 year following the grant of inspection but such grant of inspection shall terminate at the end of 1 year after its issuance unless prior thereto such certification has been obtained and the other requirements of subsection 21(b) are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of any activity which will affect water quality but for which there are no applicable water quality standards, no certification is required prior to the grant of inspection but

such grant will be conditioned upon a requirement of compliance with the purpose of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as provided in paragraph 21(b)(9) of said Act.
