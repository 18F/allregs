                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Whether a franchise or other contractual arrangement affects the  status of the enterprise as ``an independently owned and controlled * *  * enterprise,'' depends upon all the facts including the terms of the  agreements and arrangements between the parties as well as the other  relationships that have been established. The term ``franchise''   is not susceptible of precise definition. While it is clear that in  every franchise a business surrenders some rights, it is equally clear  that every franchise does not necessarily deprive an enterprise of its  character as an independently owned and operated business. This matter  was the subject of legislative consideration in connection with other  provisions of the 1961 amendments to the Act. The Senate Report on the  amendments, in discussing the effects of franchises and similar  arrangements on the scope of the ``enterprise'' under section 3(r) of  the Act, stated as follows:</p><p class="depth0">There may be a number of different types of arrangements established  in such cases. The key in each case may be found in the answer to the  question, ``Who receives the profits, suffers the losses, sets the wages  and working conditions of employees, or otherwise manages the business  in those respects which are the common attributes of an independent  businessman operating a business for profit?''</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">In all of these cases if it is found on the basis of all the facts  and circumstances that the arrangements are so restrictive as to  products, prices, profits, or management as to deny the ``franchised''  establishment the essential prerogative of the ordinary independent  businessman, the establishment, the dealer, or concessionaire will be  considered an integral part of the related activities of the enterprise  which grants the franchise, rights or concession. (S. Rep. 145, 87th  Cong., first session, p. 42.)   Thus there may be a number of different types of arrangements  established in such cases and the determination as to whether the  arrangements have the effect of depriving the enterprise of its  independent ownership or control will necessarily depend on all the  facts. The fact that the distributor hires and controls the employees  engaged in distribution of the product does not establish the requisite  independence of the distributor; it is only one factor to be considered  (Wirtz v. Lunsford, 404 F. 2d 693 (C.A. 6).) Ultimately the  determination of the precise scope of such arrangements and their effect  upon the independent ownership and control of the enterprise under  section 7(b)(3), as well as on the question whether such arrangements  result in creating a larger enterprise, rests with the courts.</p>
