For loans approved after RUS approval of the modernization plan in the borrower's state, the proposed construction must conform to the modernization plan, as required by 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B. To obtain approval, the borrower shall submit a written proposal containing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the work, indicating any deviations from the approved LD or RUS standards and specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An engineering study covering the deviations if there are changes in the design.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A cost estimate for labor, engineering, materials, and overheads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If applicable, a brief analysis from the borrower demonstrating that the proposed changes conform to the modernization plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Before any construction, including interim construction, is initiated, the GFR shall meet with the borrower to review the LD to determine if any significant changes have occurred since its approval by RUS. It is important that the design and construction of the proposed facilities be based on the latest information on subscriber needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the borrower and GFR agree that there have been no significant changes, the borrower may proceed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the GFR finds that the LD is no longer satisfactory, the borrower shall prepare an amendment to the LD incorporating the necessary revisions (See 7 CFR part 1737). The borrower must obtain RUS approval of the LD amendment before proceeding with engineering activities on any project to be financed with loan funds.
