These activities generally include lakeshore management, installation of boat ramps, erosion protection along the banks of navigation channels, jetty maintenance, remedial erosion control, etc. While these activities are normally addressed in the existing environmental impact statement for the project, new technology or unexpected events such as storms or high waters may require maintenance or remedial work not fully addressed in existing environmental documents or state permits. In determining compliance with the applicable environmental laws and regulations the district engineer should use the CWA exemptions at 404(f) and NEPA categorical exclusions to the maximum extent practicable. If the district engineer decides that the

changes have not been adequately addressed in existing environmental documentation, the procedures of this part should be followed.
