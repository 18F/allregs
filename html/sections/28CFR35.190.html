The Section- by-Section Analysis follows the order of the title II regulation itself,  except that, if the Department has not changed a regulatory section, the  unchanged section has not been mentioned.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart A--General</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.104 Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">``1991 Standards'' and ``2004 ADAAG''</p><p class="depth0">The Department has included in the final rule new definitions of  both the ``1991 Standards'' and the ``2004 ADAAG.'' The term ``1991  Standards'' refers to the ADA Standards for Accessible Design,  originally published on July 26, 1991, and republished as Appendix D to  part 36. The term ``2004 ADAAG'' refers to ADA Chapter 1, ADA Chapter 2,  and Chapters 3 through 10 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and  Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Guidelines, which were issued  by the Access Board on July 23, 2004, 36 CFR 1191, app. B and D (2009),  and which the Department has adopted in this final rule. These terms are  included in the definitions section for ease of reference.</p><p class="depth0">``2010 Standards''</p><p class="depth0">The Department has added to the final rule a definition of the term  ``2010 Standards.'' The term ``2010 Standards'' refers to the 2010 ADA  Standards for Accessible Design, which   consist of the 2004 ADAAG and the requirements contained in Sec.   35.151.</p><p class="depth0">``Auxiliary Aids and Services''</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed revisions to the definition of  auxiliary aids and services under Sec.  35.104 to include several  additional types of auxiliary aids that have become more readily  available since the promulgation of the 1991 title II regulation, and in  recognition of new technology and devices available in some places that  may provide effective communication in some situations.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM proposed adding an explicit reference to written notes in  the definition of ``auxiliary aids.'' Although this policy was already  enunciated in the Department's 1993 Title II Technical Assistance Manual  at II-7.1000, the Department proposed inclusion in the regulation itself  because some Title II entities do not understand that exchange of  written notes using paper and pencil is an available option in some  circumstances. See Department of Justice, The Americans with  Disabilities Act, Title II Technical Assistance Manual Covering State  and Local Government Programs and Services (1993), available at http:// www.ada.gov/taman2.html. Comments from several disability advocacy  organizations and individuals discouraged the Department from including  the exchange of written notes in the list of available auxiliary aids in  Sec.  35.104. Advocates and persons with disabilities requested explicit  limits on the use of written notes as a form of auxiliary aid because,  they argue, most exchanges are not simple and are not communicated  effectively using handwritten notes. One major advocacy organization,  for example, noted that the speed at which individuals communicate  orally or use sign language averages about 200 words per minute or more  while exchange of notes often leads to truncated or incomplete  communication. For persons whose primary language is American Sign  Language (ASL), some commenters pointed out, using written English in  exchange of notes often is ineffective because ASL syntax and vocabulary  is dissimilar from English. By contrast, some commenters from  professional medical associations sought more specific guidance on when  notes are allowed, especially in the context of medical offices and  health care situations.</p><p class="depth0">Exchange of notes likely will be effective in situations that do not  involve substantial conversation, for example, blood work for routine  lab tests or regular allergy shots. Video Interpreting Services  (hereinafter referred to as ``video remote interpreting services'' or  VRI) or an interpreter should be used when the matter involves greater  complexity, such as in situations requiring communication of medical  history or diagnoses, in conversations about medical procedures and  treatment decisions, or when giving instructions for care at home or  elsewhere. In the Section-By-Section Analysis of Sec.  35.160  (Communications) below, the Department discusses in greater detail the  kinds of situations in which interpreters or captioning would be  necessary. Additional guidance on this issue can be found in a number of  agreements entered into with health-care providers and hospitals that  are available on the Department's Web site at http://www.ada.gov.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, in paragraph (1) of the definition in Sec.  35.104, the  Department proposed replacing the term ``telecommunications devices for  deaf persons (TDD)'' with the term ``text telephones (TTYs).'' TTY has  become the commonly accepted term and is consistent with the terminology  used by the Access Board in the 2004 ADAAG. Commenters representing  advocates and persons with disabilities expressed approval of the  substitution of TTY for TDD in the proposed regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Commenters also expressed the view that the Department should expand  paragraph (1) of the definition of auxiliary aids to include ``TTY's and  other voice, text, and video-based telecommunications products and  systems such as videophones and captioned telephones.'' The Department  has considered these comments and has revised the definition of  ``auxiliary aids'' to include references to voice, text, and video-based  telecommunications products and systems, as well as accessible  electronic and information technology.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department also proposed including a reference in  paragraph (1) to a new technology, Video Interpreting Services (VIS).  The reference remains in the final rule. VIS is discussed in the  Section-By-Section Analysis below in reference to Sec.  35.160  (Communications), but is referred to as VRI in both the final rule and  Appendix A to more accurately reflect the terminology used in other  regulations and among users of the technology.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department noted that technological advances in the  18 years since the ADA's enactment had increased the range of auxiliary  aids and services for those who are blind or have low vision. As a  result the Department proposed additional examples to paragraph (2) of  the definition, including Brailled materials and displays, screen reader  software, optical readers, secondary auditory programs (SAP), and  accessible electronic and information technology. Some commenters asked  for more detailed requirements for auxiliary aids for persons with  vision disabilities. The Department has decided it will not make  additional changes to that provision at this time.</p><p class="depth0">Several comments suggested expanding the auxiliary aids provision  for persons who are both deaf and blind, and in particular, to include  in the list of auxiliary aids a new category, ``support service  providers (SSP),''   which was described in comments as a navigator and communication  facilitator. The Department believes that services provided by  communication facilitators are already encompassed in the requirement to  provide qualified interpreters. Moreover, the Department is concerned  that as described by the commenters, the category of support service  providers would include some services that would be considered personal  services and that do not qualify as auxiliary aids. Accordingly, the  Department declines to add this new category to the list at this time.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters representing advocacy organizations and individuals  asked the Department to explicitly require title II entities to make any  or all of the devices or technology available in all situations upon the  request of the person with a disability. The Department recognizes that  such devices or technology may provide effective communication and in  some circumstances may be effective for some persons, but the Department  does not intend to require that every entity covered by title II provide  every device or all new technology at all times as long as the  communication that is provided is as effective as communication with  others. The Department recognized in the preamble to the 1991 title II  regulation that the list of auxiliary aids was ``not an all-inclusive or  exhaustive catalogue of possible or available auxiliary aids or  services. It is not possible to provide an exhaustive list, and an  attempt to do so would omit the new devices that will become available  with emerging technology.'' 28 CFR part 35, app. A at 560 (2009). The  Department continues to endorse that view; thus, the inclusion of a list  of examples of possible auxiliary aids in the definition of ``auxiliary  aids'' should not be read as a mandate for a title II entity to offer  every possible auxiliary aid listed in the definition in every  situation.</p><p class="depth0">``Direct Threat''</p><p class="depth0">In Appendix A of the Department's 1991 title II regulation, the  Department included a detailed discussion of ``direct threat'' that,  among other things, explained that ``the principles established in Sec.   36.208 of the Department's [title III] regulation'' were ``applicable''  as well to title II, insofar as ``questions of safety are involved.'' 28  CFR part 35, app. A at 565 (2009). In the final rule, the Department has  included an explicit definition of ``direct threat'' that is parallel to  the definition in the title III rule and placed it in the definitions  section at Sec.  35.104.</p><p class="depth0">``Existing Facility''</p><p class="depth0">The 1991 title II regulation provided definitions for ``new  construction'' at Sec.  35.151(a) and ``alterations'' at Sec.   35.151(b). In contrast, the term ``existing facility'' was not  explicitly defined, although it is used in the statute and regulations  for title II. See 42 U.S.C. 12134(b); 28 CFR 35.150. It has been the  Department's view that newly constructed or altered facilities are also  existing facilities with continuing program access obligations, and that  view is made explicit in this rule.</p><p class="depth0">The classification of facilities under the ADA is neither static nor  mutually exclusive. Newly constructed or altered facilities are also  existing facilities. A newly constructed facility remains subject to the  accessibility standards in effect at the time of design and  construction, with respect to those elements for which, at that time,  there were applicable ADA Standards. And at some point, the facility may  undergo alterations, which are subject to the alterations requirements  in effect at the time. See Sec.  35.151(b)-(c). The fact that the  facility is also an existing facility does not relieve the public entity  of its obligations under the new construction and alterations  requirements in this part.</p><p class="depth0">For example, a facility constructed or altered after the effective  date of the original title II regulations but prior to the effective  date of the revised title II regulation and Standards, must have been  built or altered in compliance with the Standards (or UFAS) in effect at  that time, in order to be in compliance with the ADA. In addition, a  ``newly constructed'' facility or ``altered'' facility is also an  ``existing facility'' for purposes of application of the title II  program accessibility requirements. Once the 2010 Standards take effect,  they will become the new reference point for determining the program  accessibility obligations of all existing facilities. This is because  the ADA contemplates that as our knowledge and understanding of  accessibility advances and evolves, this knowledge will be incorporated  into and result in increased accessibility in the built environment.  Under title II, this goal is accomplished through the statute's program  access framework. While newly constructed or altered facilities must  meet the accessibility standards in effect at the time, the fact that  these facilities are also existing facilities ensures that the  determination of whether a program is accessible is not frozen at the  time of construction or alteration. Program access may require  consideration of potential barriers to access that were not recognized  as such at the time of construction or alteration, including, but not  limited to, the elements that are first covered in the 2010 Standards,  as that term is defined in Sec.  35.104. Adoption of the 2010 Standards  establishes a new reference point for title II entities that choose to  make structural changes to existing facilities to meet their program  access requirements.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM included the following proposed definition of ``existing  facility.'' ``A facility that has been constructed and remains in  existence on any given date.'' 73 FR 34466, 34504 (June 17, 2008). The  Department received a   number of comments on this issue. The commenters urged the Department to  clarify that all buildings remain subject to the standards in effect at  the time of their construction, that is, that a facility designed and  constructed for first occupancy between January 26, 1992, and the  effective date of the final rule is still considered ``new  construction'' and that alterations occurring between January 26, 1992,  and the effective date of the final rule are still considered  ``alterations.''</p><p class="depth0">The final rule includes clarifying language to ensure that the  Department's interpretation is accurately reflected. As established by  this rule, existing facility means a facility in existence on any given  date, without regard to whether the facility may also be considered  newly constructed or altered under this part. Thus, this definition  reflects the Department's interpretation that public entities have  program access requirements that are independent of, but may coexist  with, requirements imposed by new construction or alteration  requirements in those same facilities.</p><p class="depth0">``Housing at a Place of Education''</p><p class="depth0">The Department has added a new definition to Sec.  35.104, ``housing  at a place of education,'' to clarify the types of educational housing  programs that are covered by this title. This section defines ``housing  at a place of education'' as ``housing operated by or on behalf of an  elementary, secondary, undergraduate, or postgraduate school, or other  place of education, including dormitories, suites, apartments, or other  places of residence.'' This definition does not apply to social service  programs that combine residential housing with social services, such as  a residential job training program.</p><p class="depth0">``Other Power-Driven Mobility Device'' and ``Wheelchair''</p><p class="depth0">Because relatively few individuals with disabilities were using  nontraditional mobility devices in 1991, there was no pressing need for  the 1991 title II regulation to define the terms ``wheelchair'' or  ``other power-driven mobility device,'' to expound on what would  constitute a reasonable modification in policies, practices, or  procedures under Sec.  35.130(b)(7), or to set forth within that section  specific requirements for the accommodation of mobility devices. Since  the issuance of the 1991 title II regulation, however, the choices of  mobility devices available to individuals with disabilities have  increased dramatically. The Department has received complaints about and  has become aware of situations where individuals with mobility  disabilities have utilized devices that are not designed primarily for  use by an individual with a mobility disability, including the Segway  [supreg] Personal Transporter (Segway [supreg] PT), golf cars, all- terrain vehicles (ATVs), and other locomotion devices.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also has received questions from public entities and  individuals with mobility disabilities concerning which mobility devices  must be accommodated and under what circumstances. Indeed, there has  been litigation concerning the legal obligations of covered entities to  accommodate individuals with mobility disabilities who wish to use an  electronic personal assistance mobility device (EPAMD), such as the  Segway [supreg] PT, as a mobility device. The Department has  participated in such litigation as amicus curiae. See Ault v. Walt  Disney World Co., No. 6:07-cv-1785-Orl-31KRS, 2009 WL 3242028 (M.D. Fla.  Oct. 6, 2009). Much of the litigation has involved shopping malls where  businesses have refused to allow persons with disabilities to use  EPAMDs. See, e.g., McElroy v. Simon Property Group, No. 08-404 RDR, 2008  WL 4277716 (D. Kan. Sept. 15, 2008) (enjoining mall from prohibiting the  use of a Segway [supreg] PT as a mobility device where an individual  agrees to all of a mall's policies for use of the device, except  indemnification); Shasta Clark, Local Man Fighting Mall Over Right to  Use Segway, WATE 6 News, July 26, 2005, available at http:// www.wate.com/Global/story.asp?s=3643674 (last visited June 24, 2010).</p><p class="depth0">In response to questions and complaints from individuals with  disabilities and covered entities concerning which mobility devices must  be accommodated and under what circumstances, the Department began  developing a framework to address the use of unique mobility devices,  concerns about their safety, and the parameters for the circumstances  under which these devices must be accommodated. As a result, the  Department's NPRM proposed two new approaches to mobility devices.  First, the Department proposed a two-tiered mobility device definition  that defined the term ``wheelchair'' separately from ``other power- driven mobility device.'' Second, the Department proposed requirements  to allow the use of devices in each definitional category. In Sec.   35.137(a), the NPRM proposed that wheelchairs and manually-powered  mobility aids used by individuals with mobility disabilities shall be  permitted in any areas open to pedestrian use. Section 35.137(b) of the  NPRM provided that a public entity ``shall make reasonable modifications  in its policies, practices, and procedures to permit the use of other  power-driven mobility devices by individuals with disabilities, unless  the public entity can demonstrate that the use of the device is not  reasonable or that its use will result in a fundamental alteration of  the public entity's service, program, or activity.'' 73 FR 34466, 34504  (June 17, 2008).</p><p class="depth0">The Department sought public comment with regard to whether these  steps would, in fact, achieve clarity on these issues. Toward   this end, the Department's NPRM asked several questions relating to the  definitions of ``wheelchair,'' ``other power-driven mobility device,''  and ``manually-powered mobility aids''; the best way to categorize  different classes of mobility devices; the types of devices that should  be included in each category; and the circumstances under which certain  mobility devices must be accommodated or may be excluded pursuant to the  policy adopted by the public entity.</p><p class="depth0">Because the questions in the NPRM that concerned mobility devices  and their accommodation were interrelated, many of the commenters'  responses did not identify the specific question to which they were  responding. Instead, the commenters grouped the questions together and  provided comments accordingly. Most commenters spoke to the issues  addressed in the Department's questions in broad terms and general  concepts. As a result, the responses to the questions posed are  discussed below in broadly grouped issue categories rather than on a  question-by-question basis.</p><p class="depth0">Two-tiered definitional approach. Commenters supported the  Department's proposal to use a two-tiered definition of mobility device.  Commenters nearly universally said that wheelchairs always should be  accommodated and that they should never be subject to an assessment with  regard to their admission to a particular public facility. In contrast,  the vast majority of commenters indicated they were in favor of allowing  public entities to conduct an assessment as to whether, and under which  circumstances, other power-driven mobility devices would be allowed on- site.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters indicated their support for the two-tiered approach  in responding to questions concerning the definition of ``wheelchair''  and ``other-powered mobility device.'' Nearly every disability advocacy  group said that the Department's two-tiered approach strikes the proper  balance between ensuring access for individuals with disabilities and  addressing fundamental alteration and safety concerns held by public  entities; however, a minority of disability advocacy groups wanted other  power-driven mobility devices to be included in the definition of  ``wheelchair.'' Most advocacy, nonprofit, and individual commenters  supported the concept of a separate definition for ``other power-driven  mobility device'' because it maintains existing legal protections for  wheelchairs while recognizing that some devices that are not designed  primarily for individuals with mobility disabilities have beneficial  uses for individuals with mobility disabilities. They also favored this  concept because it recognizes technological developments and that the  innovative uses of varying devices may provide increased access to  individuals with mobility disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Many environmental, transit system, and government commenters  indicated they opposed in its entirety the concept of ``other power- driven mobility devices'' as a separate category. They believe that the  creation of a second category of mobility devices will mean that other  power-driven mobility devices, specifically ATVs and off-highway  vehicles, must be allowed to go anywhere on national park lands, trails,  recreational areas, etc.; will conflict with other Federal land  management laws and regulations; will harm the environment and natural  and cultural resources; will pose safety risks to users of these  devices, as well as to pedestrians not expecting to encounter motorized  devices in these settings; will interfere with the recreational  enjoyment of these areas; and will require too much administrative work  to regulate which devices are allowed and under which circumstances.  These commenters all advocated a single category of mobility devices  that excludes all fuel-powered devices.</p><p class="depth0">Whether or not they were opposed to the two-tier approach in its  entirety, virtually every environmental commenter and most government  commenters associated with providing public transportation services or  protecting land, natural resources, fish and game, etc., said that the  definition of ``other power-driven mobility device'' is too broad. They  suggested that they might be able to support the dual category approach  if the definition of ``other power-driven mobility device'' were  narrowed. They expressed general and program-specific concerns about  permitting the use of other power-driven mobility devices. They noted  the same concerns as those who opposed the two-tiered concept--that  these devices create a host of environmental, safety, cost,  administrative and conflict of law issues. Virtually all of these  commenters indicated that their support for the dual approach and the  concept of other power-driven mobility devices is, in large measure, due  to the other power-driven mobility device assessment factors in Sec.   35.137(c) of the NPRM.</p><p class="depth0">By maintaining the two-tiered approach to mobility devices and  defining ``wheelchair'' separately from ``other power-driven mobility  device,'' the Department is able to preserve the protection users of  traditional wheelchairs and other manually powered mobility aids have  had since the ADA was enacted, while also recognizing that human  ingenuity, personal choice, and new technologies have led to the use of  devices that may be more beneficial for individuals with certain  mobility disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Moreover, the Department believes the two-tiered approach gives  public entities guidance to follow in assessing whether reasonable  modifications can be made to permit the use of other power-driven  mobility devices on-site and to aid in the development   of policies describing the circumstances under which persons with  disabilities may use such devices. The two-tiered approach neither  mandates that all other power-driven mobility devices be accommodated in  every circumstance, nor excludes these devices. This approach, in  conjunction with the factor assessment provisions in Sec.  35.137(b)(2),  will serve as a mechanism by which public entities can evaluate their  ability to accommodate other power-driven mobility devices. As will be  discussed in more detail below, the assessment factors in Sec.   35.137(b)(2) are designed to provide guidance to public entities  regarding whether it is appropriate to bar the use of a specific ``other  power-driven mobility device in a specific facility. In making such a  determination, a public entity must consider the device's type, size,  weight, dimensions, and speed; the facility's volume of pedestrian  traffic; the facility's design and operational characteristics; whether  the device conflicts with legitimate safety requirements; and whether  the device poses a substantial risk of serious harm to the immediate  environment or natural or cultural resources, or conflicts with Federal  land management laws or regulations. In addition, if under Sec.   35.130(b)(7), the public entity claims that it cannot make reasonable  modifications to its policies, practices, or procedures to permit the  use of other power-driven mobility devices by individuals with  disabilities, the burden of proof to demonstrate that such devices  cannot be operated in accordance with legitimate safety requirements  rests upon the public entity.</p><p class="depth0">Categorization of wheelchair versus other power-driven mobility  devices. Implicit in the creation of the two-tiered mobility device  concept is the question of how to categorize which devices are  wheelchairs and which are other power-driven mobility devices. Finding  weight and size to be too restrictive, the vast majority of advocacy,  nonprofit, and individual commenters opposed using the Department of  Transportation's definition of ``common wheelchair'' to designate the  mobility device's appropriate category. Commenters who generally  supported using weight and size as the method of categorization did so  because of their concerns about potentially detrimental impacts on the  environment and cultural and natural resources; on the enjoyment of the  facility by other recreational users, as well as their safety; on the  administrative components of government agencies required to assess  which devices are appropriate on narrow, steeply sloped, or foot-and- hoof only trails; and about the impracticality of accommodating such  devices in public transportation settings.</p><p class="depth0">Many environmental, transit system, and government commenters also  favored using the device's intended-use to categorize which devices  constitute wheelchairs and which are other power-driven mobility  devices. Furthermore, the intended-use determinant received a fair  amount of support from advocacy, nonprofit, and individual commenters,  either because they sought to preserve the broad accommodation of  wheelchairs or because they sympathized with concerns about individuals  without mobility disabilities fraudulently bringing other power-driven  mobility devices into public facilities.</p><p class="depth0">Commenters seeking to have the Segway[supreg] PT included in the  definition of ``wheelchair'' objected to classifying mobility devices on  the basis of their intended use because they felt that such a  classification would be unfair and prejudicial to Segway[supreg] PT  users and would stifle personal choice, creativity, and innovation.  Other advocacy and nonprofit commenters objected to employing an  intended-use approach because of concerns that the focus would shift to  an assessment of the device, rather than the needs or benefits to the  individual with the mobility disability. They were of the view that the  mobility-device classification should be based on its function--whether  it is used for a mobility disability. A few commenters raised the  concern that an intended-use approach might embolden public entities to  assess whether an individual with a mobility disability really needs to  use the other power-driven mobility device at issue or to question why a  wheelchair would not provide sufficient mobility. Those citing  objections to the intended use determinant indicated it would be more  appropriate to make the categorization determination based on whether  the device is being used for a mobility disability in the context of the  impact of its use in a specific environment. Some of these commenters  preferred this approach because it would allow the Segway[supreg] PT to  be included in the definition of ``wheelchair.''</p><p class="depth0">Many environmental and government commenters were inclined to  categorize mobility devices by the way in which they are powered, such  as battery-powered engines versus fuel or combustion engines. One  commenter suggested using exhaust level as the determinant. Although  there were only a few commenters who would make the determination based  on indoor or outdoor use, there was nearly universal support for banning  the indoor use of devices that are powered by fuel or combustion  engines.</p><p class="depth0">A few commenters thought it would be appropriate to categorize the  devices based on their maximum speed. Others objected to this approach,  stating that circumstances should dictate the appropriate speed at which  mobility devices should be operated--for example, a faster speed may be  safer when crossing streets than it would be for sidewalk use--and  merely because a device can go a certain speed does not mean it will be  operated at that speed.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has decided to maintain the device's intended use as  the appropriate determinant for which devices are categorized as  ``wheelchairs.'' However, because wheelchairs may be intended for use by  individuals who have temporary conditions affecting mobility, the  Department has decided that it is more appropriate to use the phrase  ``primarily designed'' rather than ``solely designed'' in making such  categorizations. The Department will not foreclose any future  technological developments by identifying or banning specific devices or  setting restrictions on size, weight, or dimensions. Moreover, devices  designed primarily for use by individuals with mobility disabilities  often are considered to be medical devices and are generally eligible  for insurance reimbursement on this basis. Finally, devices designed  primarily for use by individuals with mobility disabilities are less  subject to fraud concerns because they were not designed to have a  recreational component. Consequently, rarely, if ever, is any inquiry or  assessment as to their appropriateness for use in a public entity  necessary.</p><p class="depth0">Definition of ``wheelchair.'' In seeking public feedback on the  NPRM's definition of ``wheelchair,'' the Department explained its  concern that the definition of ``wheelchair'' in section 508(c)(2) of  the ADA (formerly section 507(c)(2), July 26, 1990, 104 Stat. 372, 42  U.S.C. 12207, renumbered section 508(c)(2), Public Law 110-325 section  6(a)(2), Sept. 25, 2008, 122 Stat. 3558), which pertains to Federal  wilderness areas, is not specific enough to provide clear guidance in  the array of settings covered by title II and that the stringent size  and weight requirements for the Department of Transportation's  definition of ``common wheelchair'' are not a good fit in the context of  most public entities. The Department noted in the NPRM that it sought a  definition of ``wheelchair'' that would include manually-operated and  power-driven wheelchairs and mobility scooters (i.e., those that  typically are single-user, have three to four wheels, and are  appropriate for both indoor and outdoor pedestrian areas), as well as a  variety of types of wheelchairs and mobility scooters with  individualized or unique features or models with different numbers of  wheels. The NPRM defined a wheelchair as ``a device designed solely for  use by an individual with a mobility impairment for the primary purpose  of locomotion in typical indoor and outdoor pedestrian areas. A  wheelchair may be manually-operated or power-driven.'' 73 FR 34466,  34479 (June 17, 2008). Although the NPRM's definition of ``wheelchair''  excluded mobility devices that are not designed solely for use by  individuals with mobility disabilities, the Department, noting that the  use of the Segway[supreg] PT by individuals with mobility disabilities  is on the upswing, inquired as to whether this device should be included  in the definition of ``wheelchair.''</p><p class="depth0">Many environment and Federal government employee commenters objected  to the Department's proposed definition of ``wheelchair'' because it  differed from the definition of ``wheelchair'' found in section  508(c)(2) of the ADA--a definition used in the statute only in  connection with a provision relating to the use of a wheelchair in a  designated wilderness area. See 42 U.S.C. 12207(c)(1). Other government  commenters associated with environmental issues wanted the phrase  ``outdoor pedestrian use'' eliminated from the definition of  ``wheelchair.'' Some transit system commenters wanted size, weight, and  dimensions to be part of the definition because of concerns about costs  associated with having to accommodate devices that exceed the dimensions  of the ``common wheelchair'' upon which the 2004 ADAAG was based.</p><p class="depth0">Many advocacy, nonprofit, and individual commenters indicated that  as long as the Department intends the scope of the term ``mobility  impairments'' to include other disabilities that cause mobility  impairments (e.g., respiratory, circulatory, stamina, etc.), they were  in support of the language. Several commenters indicated a preference  for the definition of ``wheelchair'' in section 508(c)(2) of the ADA.  One commenter indicated a preference for the term ``assistive device,''  as it is defined in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, over the term  ``wheelchair.'' A few commenters indicated that strollers should be  added to the preamble's list of examples of wheelchairs because parents  of children with disabilities frequently use strollers as mobility  devices until their children get older.</p><p class="depth0">In the final rule, the Department has rearranged some wording and  has made some changes in the terminology used in the definition of  ``wheelchair,'' but essentially has retained the definition, and  therefore the rationale, that was set forth in the NPRM. Again, the text  of the ADA makes the definition of ``wheelchair'' contained in section  508(c)(2) applicable only to the specific context of uses in designated  wilderness areas, and therefore does not compel the use of that  definition for any other purpose. Moreover, the Department maintains  that limiting the definition to devices suitable for use in an ``indoor  pedestrian area'' as provided for in section 508(c)(2) of the ADA, would  ignore the technological advances in wheelchair design that have  occurred since the ADA went into effect and that the inclusion of the  phrase ``indoor pedestrian area'' in the definition of ``wheelchair''  would set back progress made by individuals with mobility disabilities  who, for many years now, have been using devices designed for locomotion   in indoor and outdoor settings. The Department has concluded that same  rationale applies to placing limits on the size, weight, and dimensions  of wheelchairs.</p><p class="depth0">With regard to the term ``mobility impairments,'' the Department  intended a broad reading so that a wide range of disabilities, including  circulatory and respiratory disabilities, that make walking difficult or  impossible, would be included. In response to comments on this issue,  the Department has revisited the issue and has concluded that the most  apt term to achieve this intent is ``mobility disability.''</p><p class="depth0">In addition, the Department has decided that it is more appropriate  to use the phrase ``primarily'' designed for use by individuals with  disabilities in the final rule, rather than ``solely'' designed for use  by individuals with disabilities--the phrase proposed in the NPRM. The  Department believes that this phrase more accurately covers the range of  devices the Department intends to fall within the definition of  ``wheelchair.''</p><p class="depth0">After receiving comments that the word ``typical'' is vague and the  phrase ``pedestrian areas'' is confusing to apply, particularly in the  context of similar, but not identical, terms used in the proposed  Standards, the Department decided to delete the term ``typical indoor  and outdoor pedestrian areas'' from the final rule. Instead, the final  rule references ``indoor or of both indoor and outdoor locomotion,'' to  make clear that the devices that fall within the definition of  ``wheelchair'' are those that are used for locomotion on indoor and  outdoor pedestrian paths or routes and not those that are intended  exclusively for traversing undefined, unprepared, or unimproved paths or  routes. Thus, the final rule defines the term ``wheelchair'' to mean ``a  manually-operated or power-driven device designed primarily for use by  an individual with a mobility disability for the main purpose of indoor  or of both indoor and outdoor locomotion.''</p><p class="depth0">Whether the definition of ``wheelchair'' includes the Segway[supreg]  PT. As discussed above, because individuals with mobility disabilities  are using the Segway[supreg] PT as a mobility device, the Department  asked whether it should be included in the definition of ``wheelchair.''  The basic Segway[supreg] PT model is a two-wheeled, gyroscopically- stabilized, battery-powered personal transportation device. The user  stands on a platform suspended three inches off the ground by wheels on  each side, grasps a T-shaped handle, and steers the device similarly to  a bicycle. Most Segway[supreg] PTs can travel up to 12\1/2\ miles per  hour, compared to the average pedestrian walking speed of three to four  miles per hour and the approximate maximum speed for power-operated  wheelchairs of six miles per hour. In a study of trail and other non- motorized transportation users including EPAMDs, the Federal Highway  Administration (FHWA) found that the eye height of individuals using  EPAMDs ranged from approximately 69 to 80 inches. See Federal Highway  Administration, Characteristics of Emerging Road and Trail Users and  Their Safety (Oct. 14, 2004), available at http://www.tfhrc.gov/safety/ pubs/04103 (last visited June 24, 2010). Thus, the Segway[supreg] PT can  operate at much greater speeds than wheelchairs, and the average user  stands much taller than most wheelchair users.</p><p class="depth0">The Segway[supreg] PT has been the subject of debate among users,  pedestrians, disability advocates, State and local governments,  businesses, and bicyclists. The fact that the Segway[supreg] PT is not  designed primarily for use by individuals with disabilities, nor used  primarily by persons with disabilities, complicates the question of to  what extent individuals with disabilities should be allowed to operate  them in areas and facilities where other power-driven mobility devices  are not allowed. Those who question the use of the Segway[supreg] PT in  pedestrian areas argue that the speed, size, and operating features of  the devices make them too dangerous to operate alongside pedestrians and  wheelchair users.</p><p class="depth0">Comments regarding whether to include the Segway[supreg] PT in the  definition of ``wheelchair'' were, by far, the most numerous received in  the category of comments regarding wheelchairs and other power-driven  mobility devices. Significant numbers of veterans with disabilities,  individuals with multiple sclerosis, and those advocating on their  behalf made concise statements of general support for the inclusion of  the Segway[supreg] PT in the definition of ``wheelchair.'' Two veterans  offered extensive comments on the topic, along with a few advocacy and  nonprofit groups and individuals with disabilities for whom sitting is  uncomfortable or impossible.</p><p class="depth0">While there may be legitimate safety issues for EPAMD users and  bystanders in some circumstances, EPAMDs and other non-traditional  mobility devices can deliver real benefits to individuals with  disabilities. Among the reasons given by commenters to include the  Segway[supreg] PT in the definition of ``wheelchair'' were that the  Segway[supreg] PT is well-suited for individuals with particular  conditions that affect mobility including multiple sclerosis,  Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, amputations,  spinal cord injuries, and other neurological disabilities, as well as  functional limitations, such as gait limitation, inability to sit or  discomfort in sitting, and diminished stamina issues. Such individuals  often find that EPAMDs are more comfortable and easier to use than more  traditional mobility devices and assist with balance, circulation, and  digestion in ways that wheelchairs do not. See Rachel Metz, Disabled  Embrace Segway, New York Times, Oct. 14, 2004. Commenters specifically  cited pressure   relief, reduced spasticity, increased stamina, and improved respiratory,  neurologic, and muscular health as secondary medical benefits from being  able to stand.</p><p class="depth0">Other arguments for including the Segway[supreg] PT in the  definition of ``wheelchair'' were based on commenters' views that the  Segway[supreg] PT offers benefits not provided by wheelchairs and  mobility scooters, including its intuitive response to body movement,  ability to operate with less coordination and dexterity than is required  for many wheelchairs and mobility scooters, and smaller footprint and  turning radius as compared to most wheelchairs and mobility scooters.  Several commenters mentioned improved visibility, either due to the  Segway[supreg] PT's raised platform or simply by virtue of being in a  standing position. And finally, some commenters advocated for the  inclusion of the Segway[supreg] PT simply based on civil rights  arguments and the empowerment and self-esteem obtained from having the  power to select the mobility device of choice.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters, regardless of their position on whether to include  the Segway[supreg] PT in the definition of ``wheelchair,'' noted that  the Segway[supreg] PT's safety record is as good as, if not better, than  the record for wheelchairs and mobility scooters.</p><p class="depth0">Most environmental, transit system, and government commenters were  opposed to including the Segway[supreg] PT in the definition of  ``wheelchair'' but were supportive of its inclusion as an ``other power- driven mobility device.'' Their concerns about including the  Segway[supreg] PT in the definition of ``wheelchair'' had to do with the  safety of the operators of these devices (e.g., height clearances on  trains and sloping trails in parks) and of pedestrians, particularly in  confined and crowded facilities or in settings where motorized devices  might be unexpected; the potential harm to the environment; the  additional administrative, insurance, liability, and defensive  litigation costs; potentially detrimental impacts on the environment and  cultural and natural resources; and the impracticality of accommodating  such devices in public transportation settings.</p><p class="depth0">Other environmental, transit system, and government commenters would  have banned all fuel-powered devices as mobility devices. In addition,  these commenters would have classified non-motorized devices as  ``wheelchairs'' and would have categorized motorized devices, such as  the Segway[supreg] PT, battery-operated wheelchairs, and mobility  scooters as ``other power-driven mobility devices.'' In support of this  position, some of these commenters argued that because their equipment  and facilities have been designed to comply with the dimensions of the  ``common wheelchair'' upon which the ADAAG is based, any device that is  larger than the prototype wheelchair would be misplaced in the  definition of ``wheelchair.''</p><p class="depth0">Still others in this group of commenters wished for only a single  category of mobility devices and would have included wheelchairs,  mobility scooters, and the Segway[supreg] PT as ``mobility devices'' and  excluded fuel-powered devices from that definition.</p><p class="depth0">Many disability advocacy and nonprofit commenters did not support  the inclusion of the Segway[supreg] PT in the definition of  ``wheelchair.'' Paramount to these commenters was the maintenance of  existing protections for wheelchair users. Because there was unanimous  agreement that wheelchair use rarely, if ever, may be restricted, these  commenters strongly favored categorizing wheelchairs separately from the  Segway[supreg] PT and other power-driven mobility devices and applying  the intended-use determinant to assign the devices to either category.  They indicated that while they support the greatest degree of access in  public entities for all persons with disabilities who require the use of  mobility devices, they recognize that under certain circumstances,  allowing the use of other power-driven mobility devices would result in  a fundamental alteration of programs, services, or activities, or run  counter to legitimate safety requirements necessary for the safe  operation of a public entity. While these groups supported categorizing  the Segway[supreg] PT as an ``other power-driven mobility device,'' they  universally noted that in their view, because the Segway[supreg] PT does  not present environmental concerns and is as safe to use as, if not  safer than, a wheelchair, it should be accommodated in most  circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has considered all the comments and has concluded  that it should not include the Segway[supreg] PT in the definition of  ``wheelchair.'' The final rule provides that the test for categorizing a  device as a wheelchair or an other power-driven mobility device is  whether the device is designed primarily for use by individuals with  mobility disabilities. Mobility scooters are included in the definition  of ``wheelchair'' because they are designed primarily for users with  mobility disabilities. However, because the current generation of  EPAMDs, including the Segway[supreg] PT, was designed for recreational  users and not primarily for use by individuals with mobility  disabilities, the Department has decided to continue its approach of  excluding EPAMDs from the definition of ``wheelchair'' and including  them in the definition of ``other power-driven mobility device.''  Although EPAMDs, such as the Segway[supreg] PT, are not included in the  definition of a ``wheelchair,'' public entities must assess whether they  can make reasonable modifications to permit individuals with mobility  disabilities to use such devices on their premises. The Department  recognizes that the Segway[supreg] PT provides many benefits to those  who use them as mobility devices, including a measure of privacy with  regard   to the nature of one's particular disability, and believes that in the  vast majority of circumstances, the application of the factors described  in Sec.  35.137 for providing access to other-powered mobility devices  will result in the admission of the Segway[supreg] PT.</p><p class="depth0">Treatment of ``manually-powered mobility aids.'' The Department's  NPRM did not define the term ``manually-powered mobility aids.''  Instead, the NPRM included a non-exhaustive list of examples in Sec.   35.137(a). The NPRM queried whether the Department should maintain this  approach to manually-powered mobility aids or whether it should adopt a  more formal definition.</p><p class="depth0">Only a few commenters addressed ``manually-powered mobility aids.''  Virtually all commenters were in favor of maintaining a non-exhaustive  list of examples of ``manually-powered mobility aids'' rather than  adopting a definition of the term. Of those who commented, a few sought  clarification of the term ``manually-powered.'' One commenter suggested  that the term be changed to ``human-powered.'' Other commenters  requested that the Department include ordinary strollers in the non- exhaustive list of ``manually-powered mobility aids.'' Since strollers  are not devices designed primarily for individuals with mobility  disabilities, the Department does not consider them to be manually- powered mobility aids; however, strollers used in the context of  transporting individuals with disabilities are subject to the same  assessment required by the ADA's title II reasonable modification  standards at Sec.  35.130(b)(7). The Department believes that because  the existing approach is clear and understood easily by the public, no  formal definition of the term ``manually-powered mobility aids'' is  required.</p><p class="depth0">Definition of ``other power-driven mobility device.'' The  Department's NPRM defined the term ``other power-driven mobility  device'' in Sec.  35.104 as ``any of a large range of devices powered by  batteries, fuel, or other engines--whether or not designed solely for  use by individuals with mobility impairments--that are used by  individuals with mobility impairments for the purpose of locomotion,  including golf cars, bicycles, electronic personal assistance mobility  devices (EPAMDs), or any mobility aid designed to operate in areas  without defined pedestrian routes.'' 73 FR 34466, 34504 (June 17, 2008).</p><p class="depth0">Nearly all environmental, transit systems, and government commenters  who supported the two-tiered concept of mobility devices said that the  Department's definition of ``other power-driven mobility device'' is  overbroad because it includes fuel-powered devices. These commenters  sought a ban on fuel-powered devices in their entirety because they  believe they are inherently dangerous and pose environmental and safety  concerns. They also argued that permitting the use of many of the  contemplated other power-driven mobility devices, fuel-powered ones  especially, would fundamentally alter the programs, services, or  activities of public entities.</p><p class="depth0">Advocacy, nonprofit, and several individual commenters supported the  definition of ``other power-driven mobility device'' because it allows  new technologies to be added in the future, maintains the existing legal  protections for wheelchairs, and recognizes that some devices,  particularly the Segway[supreg] PT, which are not designed primarily for  individuals with mobility disabilities, have beneficial uses for  individuals with mobility disabilities. Despite support for the  definition of ``other power-driven mobility device,'' however, most  advocacy and nonprofit commenters expressed at least some hesitation  about the inclusion of fuel-powered mobility devices in the definition.  While virtually all of these commenters noted that a blanket exclusion  of any device that falls under the definition of ``other power-driven  mobility device'' would violate basic civil rights concepts, they also  specifically stated that certain devices, particularly, off-highway  vehicles, cannot be permitted in certain circumstances. They also made a  distinction between the Segway[supreg] PT and other power-driven  mobility devices, noting that the Segway[supreg] PT should be  accommodated in most circumstances because it satisfies the safety and  environmental elements of the policy analysis. These commenters  indicated that they agree that other power-driven mobility devices must  be assessed, particularly as to their environmental impact, before they  are accommodated.</p><p class="depth0">Although many commenters had reservations about the inclusion of  fuel-powered devices in the definition of other power-driven mobility  devices, the Department does not want the definition to be so narrow  that it would foreclose the inclusion of new technological developments  (whether powered by fuel or by some other means). It is for this reason  that the Department has maintained the phrase ``any mobility device  designed to operate in areas without defined pedestrian routes'' in the  final rule's definition of other power-driven mobility devices. The  Department believes that the limitations provided by ``fundamental  alteration'' and the ability to impose legitimate safety requirements  will likely prevent the use of fuel and combustion engine-driven devices  indoors, as well as in outdoor areas with heavy pedestrian traffic. The  Department notes, however, that in the future, technological  developments may result in the production of safe fuel-powered mobility  devices that do not pose environmental and safety concerns. The final  rule allows consideration to be given as to whether the use of a fuel- powered device would create a substantial risk of serious harm to the  environment or natural or cultural resources, and to whether the use of   such a device conflicts with Federal land management laws or  regulations; this aspect of the final rule will further limit the  inclusion of fuel-powered devices where they are not appropriate.  Consequently, the Department has maintained fuel-powered devices in the  definition of ``other power-driven mobility device.'' The Department has  also added language to the definition of ``other power-driven mobility  device'' to reiterate that the definition does not apply to Federal  wilderness areas, which are not covered by title II of the ADA; the use  of wheelchairs in such areas is governed by section 508(c)(2) of the  ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12207(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">``Qualified Interpreter''</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed adding language to the  definition of ``qualified interpreter'' to clarify that the term  includes, but is not limited to, sign language interpreters, oral  interpreters, and cued-speech interpreters. As the Department explained,  not all interpreters are qualified for all situations. For example, a  qualified interpreter who uses American Sign Language (ASL) is not  necessarily qualified to interpret orally. In addition, someone with  only a rudimentary familiarity with sign language or finger spelling is  not qualified, nor is someone who is fluent in sign language but unable  to translate spoken communication into ASL or to translate signed  communication into spoken words.</p><p class="depth0">As further explained, different situations will require different  types of interpreters. For example, an oral interpreter who has special  skill and training to mouth a speaker's words silently for individuals  who are deaf or hard of hearing may be necessary for an individual who  was raised orally and taught to read lips or was diagnosed with hearing  loss later in life and does not know sign language. An individual who is  deaf or hard of hearing may need an oral interpreter if the speaker's  voice is unclear, if there is a quick-paced exchange of communication  (e.g., in a meeting), or when the speaker does not directly face the  individual who is deaf or hard of hearing. A cued-speech interpreter  functions in the same manner as an oral interpreter except that he or  she also uses a hand code or cue to represent each speech sound.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received many comments regarding the proposed  modifications to the definition of ``interpreter.'' Many commenters  requested that the Department include within the definition a  requirement that interpreters be certified, particularly if they reside  in a State that licenses or certifies interpreters. Other commenters  opposed a certification requirement as unduly limiting, noting that an  interpreter may well be qualified even if that same interpreter is not  certified. These commenters noted the absence of nationwide standards or  universally accepted criteria for certification.</p><p class="depth0">On review of this issue, the Department has decided against imposing  a certification requirement under the ADA. It is sufficient under the  ADA that the interpreter be qualified. However, as the Department stated  in the original preamble, this rule does not invalidate or limit State  or local laws that impose standards for interpreters that are equal to  or more stringent than those imposed by this definition. See 28 CFR part  35, app. A at 566 (2009). For instance, the definition would not  supersede any requirement of State law for use of a certified  interpreter in court proceedings.</p><p class="depth0">With respect to the proposed additions to the rule, most commenters  supported the expansion of the list of qualified interpreters, and some  advocated for the inclusion of other types of interpreters on the list  as well, such as deaf-blind interpreters, certified deaf interpreters,  and speech-to-speech interpreters. As these commenters explained, deaf- blind interpreters are interpreters who have specialized skills and  training to interpret for individuals who are deaf and blind; certified  deaf interpreters are deaf or hard of hearing interpreters who work with  hearing sign language interpreters to meet the specific communication  needs of deaf individuals; and speech-to-speech interpreters have  special skill and training to interpret for individuals who have speech  disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">The list of interpreters in the definition of qualified interpreter  is illustrative, and the Department does not believe it necessary or  appropriate to attempt to provide an exhaustive list of qualified  interpreters. Accordingly, the Department has decided not to expand the  proposed list. However, if a deaf and blind individual needs interpreter  services, an interpreter who is qualified to handle the needs of that  individual may be required. The guiding criterion is that the public  entity must provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services to ensure  effective communication with the individual. Commenters also suggested  various definitions for the term ``cued-speech interpreters,'' and  different descriptions of the tasks they performed. After reviewing the  various comments, the Department has determined that it is more accurate  and appropriate to refer to such individuals as ``cued-language  transliterators.'' Likewise, the Department has changed the term ``oral  interpreters'' to ``oral transliterators.'' These two changes have been  made to distinguish between sign language interpreters, who translate  one language into another language (e.g., ASL to English and English to  ASL), from transliterators who interpret within the same language  between deaf and hearing individuals. A cued-language transliterator is   an interpreter who has special skill and training in the use of the Cued  Speech system of handshapes and placements, along with non-manual  information, such as facial expression and body language, to show  auditory information visually, including speech and environmental  sounds. An oral transliterator is an interpreter who has special skill  and training to mouth a speaker's words silently for individuals who are  deaf or hard of hearing. While the Department included definitions for  ``cued-speech interpreter'' and ``oral interpreter'' in the regulatory  text proposed in the NPRM, the Department has decided that it is  unnecessary to include such definitions in the text of the final rule.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters questioned the proposed deletion of the requirement  that a qualified interpreter be able to interpret both receptively and  expressively, noting the importance of both these skills. Commenters  stated that this phrase was carefully crafted in the original regulation  to make certain that interpreters both (1) are capable of understanding  what a person with a disability is saying and (2) have the skills needed  to convey information back to that individual. These are two very  different skill sets and both are equally important to achieve effective  communication. For example, in a medical setting, a sign language  interpreter must have the necessary skills to understand the grammar and  syntax used by an ASL user (receptive skills) and the ability to  interpret complicated medical information--presented by medical staff in  English--back to that individual in ASL (expressive skills). The  Department agrees and has put the phrase ``both receptively and  expressively'' back in the definition.</p><p class="depth0">Several advocacy groups suggested that the Department make clear in  the definition of qualified interpreter that the interpreter may appear  either on-site or remotely using a video remote interpreting (VRI)  service. Given that the Department has included in this rule both a  definition of VRI services and standards that such services must  satisfy, such an addition to the definition of qualified interpreter is  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">After consideration of all relevant information submitted during the  public comment period, the Department has modified the definition from  that initially proposed in the NPRM. The final definition now states  that ``[q]ualified interpreter means an interpreter who, via a video  remote interpreting (VRI) service or an on-site appearance, is able to  interpret effectively, accurately, and impartially, both receptively and  expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary. Qualified  interpreters include, for example, sign language interpreters, oral  transliterators, and cued-language transliterators.''</p><p class="depth0">``Qualified Reader''</p><p class="depth0">The 1991 title II regulation identifies a qualified reader as an  auxiliary aid, but did not define the term. See 28 CFR 35.104(2). Based  upon the Department's investigation of complaints alleging that some  entities have provided ineffective readers, the Department proposed in  the NPRM to define ``qualified reader'' similarly to ``qualified  interpreter'' to ensure that entities select qualified individuals to  read an examination or other written information in an effective,  accurate, and impartial manner. This proposal was suggested in order to  make clear to public entities that a failure to provide a qualified  reader to a person with a disability may constitute a violation of the  requirement to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received comments supporting inclusion in the  regulation of a definition of a ``qualified reader.'' Some commenters  suggested the Department add to the definition a requirement prohibiting  the use of a reader whose accent, diction, or pronunciation makes full  comprehension of material being read difficult. Another commenter  requested that the Department include a requirement that the reader  ``will follow the directions of the person for whom he or she is  reading.'' Commenters also requested that the Department define  ``accurately'' and ``effectively'' as used in this definition.</p><p class="depth0">While the Department believes that its proposed regulatory  definition adequately addresses these concerns, the Department  emphasizes that a reader, in order to be ``qualified,'' must be skilled  in reading the language and subject matter and must be able to be easily  understood by the individual with the disability. For example, if a  reader is reading aloud the questions for a college microbiology  examination, that reader, in order to be qualified, must know the proper  pronunciation of scientific terminology used in the text, and must be  sufficiently articulate to be easily understood by the individual with a  disability for whom he or she is reading. In addition, the terms  ``effectively'' and ``accurately'' have been successfully used and  understood in the Department's existing definition of ``qualified  interpreter'' since 1991 without specific regulatory definitions.  Instead, the Department has relied upon the common use and understanding  of those terms from standard English dictionaries. Thus, the definition  of ``qualified reader'' has not been changed from that contained in the  NPRM. The final rule defines ``qualified reader'' to mean ``a person who  is able to read effectively, accurately, and impartially using any  necessary specialized vocabulary.''</p><p class="depth0">``Service Animal''</p><p class="depth0">Although there is no specific language in the 1991 title II  regulation concerning service animals, title II entities have the same  legal obligations as title III entities to make reasonable modifications  in policies, practices, or procedures to allow service animals when  necessary in order to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,  unless the entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would  fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity. See  28 CFR 35.130(b)(7). The 1991 title III regulation, 28 CFR 36.104,  defines a ``service animal'' as ``any guide dog, signal dog, or other  animal individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit  of an individual with a disability, including, but not limited to,  guiding individuals with impaired vision, alerting individuals with  impaired hearing to intruders or sounds, providing minimal protection or  rescue work, pulling a wheelchair, or fetching dropped items.'' Section  36.302(c)(1) of the 1991 title III regulation requires that  ``[g]enerally, a public accommodation shall modify policies, practices,  or procedures to permit the use of a service animal by an individual  with a disability.'' Section 36.302(c)(2) of the 1991 title III  regulation states that ``a public accommodation [is not required] to  supervise or care for a service animal.''</p><p class="depth0">The Department has issued guidance and provided technical assistance  and publications concerning service animals since the 1991 regulations  became effective. In the NPRM, the Department proposed to modify the  definition of service animal, added the definition to title II, and  asked for public input on several issues related to the service animal  provisions of the title II regulation: whether the Department should  clarify the phrase ``providing minimal protection'' in the definition or  remove it; whether there are any circumstances where a service animal  ``providing minimal protection'' would be appropriate or expected;  whether certain species should be eliminated from the definition of  ``service animal,'' and, if so, which types of animals should be  excluded; whether ``common domestic animal'' should be part of the  definition; and whether a size or weight limitation should be imposed  for common domestic animals even if the animal satisfies the ``common  domestic animal'' part of the NPRM definition.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received extensive comments on these issues, as well  as requests to clarify the obligations of State and local government  entities to accommodate individuals with disabilities who use service  animals, and has modified the final rule in response. In the interests  of avoiding unnecessary repetition, the Department has elected to  discuss the issues raised in the NPRM questions about service animals  and the corresponding public comments in the following discussion of the  definition of ``service animal.''</p><p class="depth0">The Department's final rule defines ``service animal'' as ``any dog  that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit  of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory,  psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. Other species of  animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, are not service  animals for the purposes of this definition. The work or tasks performed  by a service animal must be directly related to the individual's  disability. Examples of work or tasks include, but are not limited to,  assisting individuals who are blind or have low vision with navigation  and other tasks, alerting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to  the presence of people or sounds, providing non-violent protection or  rescue work, pulling a wheelchair, assisting an individual during a  seizure, alerting individuals to the presence of allergens, retrieving  items such as medicine or the telephone, providing physical support and  assistance with balance and stability to individuals with mobility  disabilities, and helping persons with psychiatric and neurological  disabilities by preventing or interrupting impulsive or destructive  behaviors. The crime deterrent effects of an animal's presence and the  provision of emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship do  not constitute work or tasks for the purposes of this definition.''</p><p class="depth0">This definition has been designed to clarify a key provision of the  ADA. Many covered entities indicated that they are confused regarding  their obligations under the ADA with regard to individuals with  disabilities who use service animals. Individuals with disabilities who  use trained guide or service dogs are concerned that if untrained or  unusual animals are termed ``service animals,'' their own right to use  guide or service dogs may become unnecessarily restricted or questioned.  Some individuals who are not individuals with disabilities have claimed,  whether fraudulently or sincerely (albeit mistakenly), that their  animals are service animals covered by the ADA, in order to gain access  to courthouses, city or county administrative offices, and other title  II facilities. The increasing use of wild, exotic, or unusual species,  many of which are untrained, as service animals has also added to the  confusion.</p><p class="depth0">Finally, individuals with disabilities who have the legal right  under the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) to use certain animals in their homes  as a reasonable accommodation to their disabilities have assumed that  their animals also qualify under the ADA. This is not necessarily the  case, as discussed below.</p><p class="depth0">The Department recognizes the diverse needs and preferences of  individuals with disabilities protected under the ADA, and does   not wish to unnecessarily impede individual choice. Service animals play  an integral role in the lives of many individuals with disabilities and,  with the clarification provided by the final rule, individuals with  disabilities will continue to be able to use their service animals as  they go about their daily activities and civic interactions. The  clarification will also help to ensure that the fraudulent or mistaken  use of other animals not qualified as service animals under the ADA will  be deterred. A more detailed analysis of the elements of the definition  and the comments responsive to the service animal provisions of the NPRM  follows.</p><p class="depth0">Providing minimal protection. As previously noted, the 1991 title II  regulation does not contain specific language concerning service  animals. The 1991 title III regulation included language stating that  ``minimal protection'' was a task that could be performed by an  individually trained service animal for the benefit of an individual  with a disability. In the Department's ``ADA Business Brief on Service  Animals'' (2002), the Department interpreted the ``minimal protection''  language within the context of a seizure (i.e., alerting and protecting  a person who is having a seizure). The Department received many comments  in response to the question of whether the ``minimal protection''  language should be clarified. Many commenters urged the removal of the  ``minimal protection'' language from the service animal definition for  two reasons: (1) The phrase can be interpreted to allow any dog that is  trained to be aggressive to qualify as a service animal simply by  pairing the animal with a person with a disability; and (2) the phrase  can be interpreted to allow any untrained pet dog to qualify as a  service animal, since many consider the mere presence of a dog to be a  crime deterrent, and thus sufficient to meet the minimal protection  standard. These commenters argued, and the Department agrees, that these  interpretations were not contemplated under the original title III  regulation, and, for the purposes of the final title II regulations, the  meaning of ``minimal protection'' must be made clear.</p><p class="depth0">While many commenters stated that they believe that the ``minimal  protection'' language should be eliminated, other commenters recommended  that the language be clarified, but retained. Commenters favoring  clarification of the term suggested that the Department explicitly  exclude the function of attack or exclude those animals that are trained  solely to be aggressive or protective. Other commenters identified non- violent behavioral tasks that could be construed as minimally  protective, such as interrupting self-mutilation, providing safety  checks and room searches, reminding the individual to take medications,  and protecting the individual from injury resulting from seizures or  unconsciousness.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters noted that the existing direct threat defense,  which allows the exclusion of a service animal if the animal exhibits  unwarranted or unprovoked violent behavior or poses a direct threat,  prevents the use of ``attack dogs'' as service animals. One commenter  noted that the use of a service animal trained to provide ``minimal  protection'' may impede access to care in an emergency, for example,  where the first responder, usually a title II entity, is unable or  reluctant to approach a person with a disability because the  individual's service animal is in a protective posture suggestive of  aggression.</p><p class="depth0">Many organizations and individuals stated that in the general dog  training community, ``protection'' is code for attack or aggression  training and should be removed from the definition. Commenters stated  that there appears to be a broadly held misconception that aggression- trained animals are appropriate service animals for persons with post  traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While many individuals with PTSD may  benefit by using a service animal, the work or tasks performed  appropriately by such an animal would not involve unprovoked aggression  but could include actively cuing the individual by nudging or pawing the  individual to alert to the onset of an episode and removing the  individual from the anxiety-provoking environment.</p><p class="depth0">The Department recognizes that despite its best efforts to provide  clarification, the ``minimal protection'' language appears to have been  misinterpreted. While the Department maintains that protection from  danger is one of the key functions that service animals perform for the  benefit of persons with disabilities, the Department recognizes that an  animal individually trained to provide aggressive protection, such as an  attack dog, is not appropriately considered a service animal. Therefore,  the Department has decided to modify the ``minimal protection'' language  to read ``non-violent protection,'' thereby excluding so-called ``attack  dogs'' or dogs with traditional ``protection training'' as service  animals. The Department believes that this modification to the service  animal definition will eliminate confusion, without restricting  unnecessarily the type of work or tasks that service animals may  perform. The Department's modification also clarifies that the crime- deterrent effect of a dog's presence, by itself, does not qualify as  work or tasks for purposes of the service animal definition.</p><p class="depth0">Alerting to intruders. The phrase ``alerting to intruders'' is  related to the issues of minimal protection and the work or tasks an  animal may perform to meet the definition of a service animal. In the  original 1991 regulatory text, this phrase was intended to identify  service animals that alert individuals   who are deaf or hard of hearing to the presence of others. This language  has been misinterpreted by some to apply to dogs that are trained  specifically to provide aggressive protection, resulting in the  assertion that such training qualifies a dog as a service animal under  the ADA. The Department reiterates that title II entities are not  required to admit any animal whose use poses a direct threat under Sec.   35.139. In addition, the Department has decided to remove the word  ``intruders'' from the service animal definition and replace it with the  phrase ``the presence of people or sounds.'' The Department believes  this clarifies that so-called ``attack training'' or other aggressive  response types of training that cause a dog to provide an aggressive  response do not qualify a dog as a service animal under the ADA.</p><p class="depth0">Conversely, if an individual uses a breed of dog that is perceived  to be aggressive because of breed reputation, stereotype, or the history  or experience the observer may have with other dogs, but the dog is  under the control of the individual with a disability and does not  exhibit aggressive behavior, the title II entity cannot exclude the  individual or the animal from a State or local government program,  service, or facility. The animal can only be removed if it engages in  the behaviors mentioned in Sec.  35.136(b) (as revised in the final  rule) or if the presence of the animal constitutes a fundamental  alteration to the nature of the service, program, or activity of the  title II entity.</p><p class="depth0">Doing ``work'' or ``performing tasks.'' The NPRM proposed that the  Department maintain the requirement, first articulated in the 1991 title  III regulation, that in order to qualify as a service animal, the animal  must ``perform tasks'' or ``do work'' for the individual with a  disability. The phrases ``perform tasks'' and ``do work'' describe what  an animal must do for the benefit of an individual with a disability in  order to qualify as a service animal.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received a number of comments in response to the NPRM  proposal urging the removal of the term ``do work'' from the definition  of a service animal. These commenters argued that the Department should  emphasize the performance of tasks instead. The Department disagrees.  Although the common definition of work includes the performance of  tasks, the definition of work is somewhat broader, encompassing  activities that do not appear to involve physical action.</p><p class="depth0">One service dog user stated that in some cases, ``critical forms of  assistance can't be construed as physical tasks,'' noting that the  manifestations of ``brain-based disabilities,'' such as psychiatric  disorders and autism, are as varied as their physical counterparts. The  Department agrees with this statement but cautions that unless the  animal is individually trained to do something that qualifies as work or  a task, the animal is a pet or support animal and does not qualify for  coverage as a service animal. A pet or support animal may be able to  discern that the individual is in distress, but it is what the animal is  trained to do in response to this awareness that distinguishes a service  animal from an observant pet or support animal.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM contained an example of ``doing work'' that stated ``a  psychiatric service dog can help some individuals with dissociative  identity disorder to remain grounded in time or place.'' 73 FR 34466,  34504 (June 17, 2008). Several commenters objected to the use of this  example, arguing that grounding was not a ``task'' and therefore, the  example inherently contradicted the basic premise that a service animal  must perform a task in order to mitigate a disability. Other commenters  stated that ``grounding'' should not be included as an example of  ``work'' because it could lead to some individuals claiming that they  should be able to use emotional support animals in public because the  dog makes them feel calm or safe. By contrast, one commenter with  experience in training service animals explained that grounding is a  trained task based upon very specific behavioral indicators that can be  observed and measured. These tasks are based upon input from mental  health practitioners, dog trainers, and individuals with a history of  working with psychiatric service dogs.</p><p class="depth0">It is the Department's view that an animal that is trained to  ``ground'' a person with a psychiatric disorder does work or performs a  task that would qualify it as a service animal as compared to an  untrained emotional support animal whose presence affects a person's  disability. It is the fact that the animal is trained to respond to the  individual's needs that distinguishes an animal as a service animal. The  process must have two steps: Recognition and response. For example, if a  service animal senses that a person is about to have a psychiatric  episode and it is trained to respond for example, by nudging, barking,  or removing the individual to a safe location until the episode  subsides, then the animal has indeed performed a task or done work on  behalf of the individual with the disability, as opposed to merely  sensing an event.</p><p class="depth0">One commenter suggested defining the term ``task,'' presumably to  improve the understanding of the types of services performed by an  animal that would be sufficient to qualify the animal for coverage. The  Department believes that the common definition of the word ``task'' is  sufficiently clear and that it is not necessary to add to the  definitions section. However, the Department has added examples of other  kinds of work or tasks to help illustrate and provide   clarity to the definition. After careful evaluation of this issue, the  Department has concluded that the phrases ``do work'' and ``perform  tasks'' have been effective during the past two decades to illustrate  the varied services provided by service animals for the benefit of  individuals with all types of disabilities. Thus, the Department  declines to depart from its longstanding approach at this time.</p><p class="depth0">Species limitations. When the Department originally issued its title  III regulation in the early 1990s, the Department did not define the  parameters of acceptable animal species. At that time, few anticipated  the variety of animals that would be promoted as service animals in the  years to come, which ranged from pigs and miniature horses to snakes,  iguanas, and parrots. The Department has followed this particular issue  closely, keeping current with the many unusual species of animals  represented to be service animals. Thus, the Department has decided to  refine further this aspect of the service animal definition in the final  rule.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received many comments from individuals and  organizations recommending species limitations. Several of these  commenters asserted that limiting the number of allowable species would  help stop erosion of the public's trust, which has resulted in reduced  access for many individuals with disabilities who use trained service  animals that adhere to high behavioral standards. Several commenters  suggested that other species would be acceptable if those animals could  meet nationally recognized behavioral standards for trained service  dogs. Other commenters asserted that certain species of animals (e.g.,  reptiles) cannot be trained to do work or perform tasks, so these  animals would not be covered.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department used the term ``common domestic animal''  in the service animal definition and excluded reptiles, rabbits, farm  animals (including horses, miniature horses, ponies, pigs, and goats),  ferrets, amphibians, and rodents from the service animal definition. 73  FR 34466, 34478 (June 17, 2008). However, the term ``common domestic  animal'' is difficult to define with precision due to the increase in  the number of domesticated species. Also, several State and local laws  define a ``domestic'' animal as an animal that is not wild. The  Department agrees with commenters' views that limiting the number and  types of species recognized as service animals will provide greater  predictability for State and local government entities as well as added  assurance of access for individuals with disabilities who use dogs as  service animals. As a consequence, the Department has decided to limit  this rule's coverage of service animals to dogs, which are the most  common service animals used by individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Wild animals, monkeys, and other nonhuman primates. Numerous  business entities endorsed a narrow definition of acceptable service  animal species, and asserted that there are certain animals (e.g.,  reptiles) that cannot be trained to do work or perform tasks. Other  commenters suggested that the Department should identify excluded  animals, such as birds and llamas, in the final rule. Although one  commenter noted that wild animals bred in captivity should be permitted  to be service animals, the Department has decided to make clear that all  wild animals, whether born or bred in captivity or in the wild, are  eliminated from coverage as service animals. The Department believes  that this approach reduces risks to health or safety attendant with wild  animals. Some animals, such as certain nonhuman primates including  certain monkeys, pose a direct threat; their behavior can be  unpredictably aggressive and violent without notice or provocation. The  American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) issued a position  statement advising against the use of monkeys as service animals,  stating that ``[t]he AVMA does not support the use of nonhuman primates  as assistance animals because of animal welfare concerns, and the  potential for serious injury and zoonotic [animal to human disease  transmission] risks.'' AVMA Position Statement, Nonhuman Primates as  Assistance Animals, (2005) available at http://www.avma.org/issues/ policy/nonhuman--primates.asp (last visited June 24, 2010).</p><p class="depth0">An organization that trains capuchin monkeys to provide in-home  services to individuals with paraplegia and quadriplegia was in  substantial agreement with the AVMA's views but requested a limited  recognition in the service animal definition for the capuchin monkeys it  trains to provide assistance for persons with disabilities. The  organization commented that its trained capuchin monkeys undergo  scrupulous veterinary examinations to ensure that the animals pose no  health risks, and are used by individuals with disabilities exclusively  in their homes. The organization acknowledged that the capuchin monkeys  it trains are not necessarily suitable for use in State or local  government facilities. The organization noted that several State and  local government entities have local zoning, licensing, health, and  safety laws that prohibit nonhuman primates, and that these prohibitions  would prevent individuals with disabilities from using these animals  even in their homes.</p><p class="depth0">The organization argued that including capuchin monkeys under the  service animal umbrella would make it easier for individuals with  disabilities to obtain reasonable modifications of State and local  licensing, health, and safety laws that would permit the use of these  monkeys. The organization argued that this limited modification to the   service animal definition was warranted in view of the services these  monkeys perform, which enable many individuals with paraplegia and  quadriplegia to live and function with increased independence.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has carefully considered the potential risks  associated with the use of nonhuman primates as service animals in State  and local government facilities, as well as the information provided to  the Department about the significant benefits that trained capuchin  monkeys provide to certain individuals with disabilities in residential  settings. The Department has determined, however, that nonhuman  primates, including capuchin monkeys, will not be recognized as service  animals for purposes of this rule because of their potential for disease  transmission and unpredictable aggressive behavior. The Department  believes that these characteristics make nonhuman primates unsuitable  for use as service animals in the context of the wide variety of public  settings subject to this rule. As the organization advocating the  inclusion of capuchin monkeys acknowledges, capuchin monkeys are not  suitable for use in public facilities.</p><p class="depth0">The Department emphasizes that it has decided only that capuchin  monkeys will not be included in the definition of service animals for  purposes of its regulation implementing the ADA. This decision does not  have any effect on the extent to which public entities are required to  allow the use of such monkeys under other Federal statutes. For example,  under the FHAct, an individual with a disability may have the right to  have an animal other than a dog in his or her home if the animal  qualifies as a ``reasonable accommodation'' that is necessary to afford  the individual equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, assuming  that the use of the animal does not pose a direct threat. In some cases,  the right of an individual to have an animal under the FHAct may  conflict with State or local laws that prohibit all individuals, with or  without disabilities, from owning a particular species. However, in this  circumstance, an individual who wishes to request a reasonable  modification of the State or local law must do so under the FHAct, not  the ADA.</p><p class="depth0">Having considered all of the comments about which species should  qualify as service animals under the ADA, the Department has determined  the most reasonable approach is to limit acceptable species to dogs.</p><p class="depth0">Size or weight limitations. The vast majority of commenters did not  support a size or weight limitation. Commenters were typically opposed  to a size or weight limit because many tasks performed by service  animals require large, strong dogs. For instance, service animals may  perform tasks such as providing balance and support or pulling a  wheelchair. Small animals may not be suitable for large adults. The  weight of the service animal user is often correlated with the size and  weight of the service animal. Others were concerned that adding a size  and weight limit would further complicate the difficult process of  finding an appropriate service animal. One commenter noted that there is  no need for a limit because ``if, as a practical matter, the size or  weight of an individual's service animal creates a direct threat or  fundamental alteration to a particular public entity or accommodation,  there are provisions that allow for the animal's exclusion or removal.''  Some common concerns among commenters in support of a size and weight  limit were that a larger animal may be less able to fit in various areas  with its handler, such as toilet rooms and public seating areas, and  that larger animals are more difficult to control.</p><p class="depth0">Balancing concerns expressed in favor of and against size and weight  limitations, the Department has determined that such limitations would  not be appropriate. Many individuals of larger stature require larger  dogs. The Department believes it would be inappropriate to deprive these  individuals of the option of using a service dog of the size required to  provide the physical support and stability these individuals may need to  function independently. Since large dogs have always served as service  animals, continuing their use should not constitute fundamental  alterations or impose undue burdens on title II entities.</p><p class="depth0">Breed limitations. A few commenters suggested that certain breeds of  dogs should not be allowed to be used as service animals. Some suggested  that the Department should defer to local laws restricting the breeds of  dogs that individuals who reside in a community may own. Other  commenters opposed breed restrictions, stating that the breed of a dog  does not determine its propensity for aggression and that aggressive and  non-aggressive dogs exist in all breeds.</p><p class="depth0">The Department does not believe that it is either appropriate or  consistent with the ADA to defer to local laws that prohibit certain  breeds of dogs based on local concerns that these breeds may have a  history of unprovoked aggression or attacks. Such deference would have  the effect of limiting the rights of persons with disabilities under the  ADA who use certain service animals based on where they live rather than  on whether the use of a particular animal poses a direct threat to the  health and safety of others. Breed restrictions differ significantly  from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions have no breed  restrictions. Others have restrictions that, while well-meaning, have  the unintended effect of screening out the very breeds of dogs that have  successfully served as service animals for decades without a history of  the type of unprovoked aggression or attacks that would pose a direct   threat, e.g., German Shepherds. Other jurisdictions prohibit animals  over a certain weight, thereby restricting breeds without invoking an  express breed ban. In addition, deference to breed restrictions  contained in local laws would have the unacceptable consequence of  restricting travel by an individual with a disability who uses a breed  that is acceptable and poses no safety hazards in the individual's home  jurisdiction but is nonetheless banned by other jurisdictions. State and  local government entities have the ability to determine, on a case-by- case basis, whether a particular service animal can be excluded based on  that particular animal's actual behavior or history--not based on fears  or generalizations about how an animal or breed might behave. This  ability to exclude an animal whose behavior or history evidences a  direct threat is sufficient to protect health and safety.</p><p class="depth0">Recognition of psychiatric service animals but not ``emotional  support animals.'' The definition of ``service animal'' in the NPRM  stated the Department's longstanding position that emotional support  animals are not included in the definition of ``service animal.'' The  proposed text in Sec.  35.104 provided that ``[a]nimals whose sole  function is to provide emotional support, comfort, therapy,  companionship, therapeutic benefits or to promote emotional well-being  are not service animals.'' 73 FR 34466, 34504 (June 17, 2008).</p><p class="depth0">Many advocacy organizations expressed concern and disagreed with the  exclusion of comfort and emotional support animals. Others have been  more specific, stating that individuals with disabilities may need their  emotional support animals in order to have equal access. Some commenters  noted that individuals with disabilities use animals that have not been  trained to perform tasks directly related to their disability. These  animals do not qualify as service animals under the ADA. These are  emotional support or comfort animals.</p><p class="depth0">Commenters asserted that excluding categories such as ``comfort''  and ``emotional support'' animals recognized by laws such as the FHAct  or the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) is confusing and burdensome. Other  commenters noted that emotional support and comfort animals perform an  important function, asserting that animal companionship helps  individuals who experience depression resulting from multiple sclerosis.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters explained the benefits emotional support animals  provide, including emotional support, comfort, therapy, companionship,  therapeutic benefits, and the promotion of emotional well-being. They  contended that without the presence of an emotional support animal in  their lives they would be disadvantaged and unable to participate in  society. These commenters were concerned that excluding this category of  animals will lead to discrimination against, and the excessive  questioning of, individuals with non-visible or non-apparent  disabilities. Other commenters expressing opposition to the exclusion of  individually trained ``comfort'' or ``emotional support'' animals  asserted that the ability to soothe or de-escalate and control emotion  is ``work'' that benefits the individual with the disability.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters requested that the Department carve out an exception  that permits current or former members of the military to use emotional  support animals. They asserted that a significant number of service  members returning from active combat duty have adjustment difficulties  due to combat, sexual assault, or other traumatic experiences while on  active duty. Commenters noted that some current or former members of the  military service have been prescribed animals for conditions such as  PTSD. One commenter stated that service women who were sexually  assaulted while in the military use emotional support animals to help  them feel safe enough to step outside their homes. The Department  recognizes that many current and former members of the military have  disabilities as a result of service-related injuries that may require  emotional support and that such individuals can benefit from the use of  an emotional support animal and could use such animal in their home  under the FHAct. However, having carefully weighed the issues, the  Department believes that its final rule appropriately addresses the  balance of issues and concerns of both the individual with a disability  and the public entity. The Department also notes that nothing in this  part prohibits a public entity from allowing current or former military  members or anyone else with disabilities to utilize emotional support  animals if it wants to do so.</p><p class="depth0">Commenters asserted the view that if an animal's ``mere presence''  legitimately provides such benefits to an individual with a disability  and if those benefits are necessary to provide equal opportunity given  the facts of the particular disability, then such an animal should  qualify as a ``service animal.'' Commenters noted that the focus should  be on the nature of a person's disability, the difficulties the  disability may impose and whether the requested accommodation would  legitimately address those difficulties, not on evaluating the animal  involved. The Department understands this approach has benefitted many  individuals under the FHAct and analogous State law provisions, where  the presence of animals poses fewer health and safety issues, and where  emotional support animals provide assistance that is unique to  residential settings. The Department believes, however, that the  presence of such animals is not required in the context of title II  entities such as courthouses, State and local government administrative  buildings, and similar title II facilities.</p><p class="depth0">Under the Department's previous regulatory framework, some  individuals and entities assumed that the requirement that service  animals must be individually trained to do work or perform tasks  excluded all individuals with mental disabilities from having service  animals. Others assumed that any person with a psychiatric condition  whose pet provided comfort to them was covered by the 1991 title II  regulation. The Department reiterates that psychiatric service animals  that are trained to do work or perform a task for individuals whose  disability is covered by the ADA are protected by the Department's  present regulatory approach. Psychiatric service animals can be trained  to perform a variety of tasks that assist individuals with disabilities  to detect the onset of psychiatric episodes and ameliorate their  effects. Tasks performed by psychiatric service animals may include  reminding individuals to take medicine, providing safety checks or room  searches for individuals with PTSD, interrupting self-mutilation, and  removing disoriented individuals from dangerous situations.</p><p class="depth0">The difference between an emotional support animal and a psychiatric  service animal is the work or tasks that the animal performs.  Traditionally, service dogs worked as guides for individuals who were  blind or had low vision. Since the original regulation was promulgated,  service animals have been trained to assist individuals with many  different types of disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">In the final rule, the Department has retained its position on the  exclusion of emotional support animals from the definition of ``service  animal.'' The definition states that ``[t]he provision of emotional  support, well-being, comfort, or companionship, * * * do[es] not  constitute work or tasks for the purposes of this definition.'' The  Department notes, however, that the exclusion of emotional support  animals from coverage in the final rule does not mean that individuals  with psychiatric or mental disabilities cannot use service animals that  meet the regulatory definition. The final rule defines service animal as  follows: ``[s]ervice animal means any dog that is individually trained  to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a  disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or  other mental disability.'' This language simply clarifies the  Department's longstanding position.</p><p class="depth0">The Department's position is based on the fact that the title II and  title III regulations govern a wider range of public settings than the  housing and transportation settings for which the Department of Housing  and Urban Development (HUD) and DOT regulations allow emotional support  animals or comfort animals. The Department recognizes that there are  situations not governed by the title II and title III regulations,  particularly in the context of residential settings and transportation,  where there may be a legal obligation to permit the use of animals that  do not qualify as service animals under the ADA, but whose presence  nonetheless provides necessary emotional support to persons with  disabilities. Accordingly, other Federal agency regulations, case law,  and possibly State or local laws governing those situations may provide  appropriately for increased access for animals other than service  animals as defined under the ADA. Public officials, housing providers,  and others who make decisions relating to animals in residential and  transportation settings should consult the Federal, State, and local  laws that apply in those areas (e.g., the FHAct regulations of HUD and  the ACAA) and not rely on the ADA as a basis for reducing those  obligations.</p><p class="depth0">Retain term ``service animal.'' Some commenters asserted that the  term ``assistance animal'' is a term of art and should replace the term  ``service animal.'' However, the majority of commenters preferred the  term ``service animal'' because it is more specific. The Department has  decided to retain the term ``service animal'' in the final rule. While  some agencies, like HUD, use the term ``assistance animal,'' ``assistive  animal,'' or ``support animal,'' these terms are used to denote a  broader category of animals than is covered by the ADA. The Department  has decided that changing the term used in the final rule would create  confusion, particularly in view of the broader parameters for coverage  under the FHAct, cf., preamble to HUD's Final Rule for Pet Ownership for  the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities, 73 FR 63834-38 (Oct. 27,  2008); HUD Handbook No. 4350.3 Rev-1, Chapter 2, Occupancy Requirements  of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs (June 2007), available at  http://www.hud.gov/offices/adm/hudclips/handbooks/hsgh/4350.3 (last  visited June 24, 2010). Moreover, as discussed above, the Department's  definition of ``service animal'' in the title II final rule does not  affect the rights of individuals with disabilities who use assistance  animals in their homes under the FHAct or who use ``emotional support  animals'' that are covered under the ACAA and its implementing  regulations. See 14 CFR 382.7 et seq.; see also Department of  Transportation, Guidance Concerning Service Animals in Air  Transportation, 68 FR 24874, 24877 (May 9, 2003) (discussing  accommodation of service animals and emotional support animals on  aircraft).</p><p class="depth0">``Video Remote Interpreting'' (VRI) Services</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed adding Video Interpreting  Services (VIS) to the list of auxiliary aids available to provide  effective communication described in Sec.  35.104. In the preamble to  the NPRM, VIS was defined as ``a technology composed of a video   phone, video monitors, cameras, a high-speed Internet connection, and an  interpreter. The video phone provides video transmission to a video  monitor that permits the individual who is deaf or hard of hearing to  view and sign to a video interpreter (i.e., a live interpreter in  another location), who can see and sign to the individual through a  camera located on or near the monitor, while others can communicate by  speaking. The video monitor can display a split screen of two live  images, with the interpreter in one image and the individual who is deaf  or hard of hearing in the other image.'' 73 FR 34446, 34479 (June 17,  2008). Comments from advocacy organizations and individuals unanimously  requested that the Department use the term ``video remote interpreting  (VRI),'' instead of VIS, for consistency with Federal Communications  Commission (FCC) regulations. See FCC Public Notice, DA-0502417 (Sept.  7, 2005), and with common usage by consumers. The Department has made  that change throughout the regulation to avoid confusion and to make the  regulation more consistent with existing regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters also requested that the Department distinguish  between VRI and ``video relay service (VRS).'' Both VRI and VRS use a  remote interpreter who is able to see and communicate with a deaf person  and a hearing person, and all three individuals may be connected by a  video link. VRI is a fee-based interpreting service conveyed via  videoconferencing where at least one person, typically the interpreter,  is at a separate location. VRI can be provided as an on-demand service  or by appointment. VRI normally involves a contract in advance for the  interpreter who is usually paid by the covered entity.</p><p class="depth0">VRS is a telephone service that enables persons with disabilities to  use the telephone to communicate using video connections and is a more  advanced form of relay service than the traditional voice to text  telephones (TTY) relay systems that were recognized in the 1991 title II  regulation. More specifically, VRS is a video relay service using  interpreters connected to callers by video hook-up and is designed to  provide telephone services to persons who are deaf and use American Sign  Language that are functionally equivalent to those provided to users who  are hearing. VRS is funded through the Interstate Telecommunications  Relay Services Fund and overseen by the FCC. See 47 CFR 64.601(a)(26).  There are no fees for callers to use the VRS interpreters and the video  connection, although there may be relatively inexpensive initial costs  to the title II entities to purchase the videophone or camera for on- line video connection, or other equipment to connect to the VRS service.  The FCC has made clear that VRS functions as a telephone service and is  not intended to be used for interpreting services where both parties are  in the same room; the latter is reserved for VRI. The Department agrees  that VRS cannot be used as a substitute for in-person interpreters or  for VRI in situations that would not, absent one party's disability,  entail use of the telephone.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters strongly recommended limiting the use of VRI to  circumstances where it will provide effective communication. Commenters  from advocacy groups and persons with disabilities expressed concern  that VRI may not always be appropriate to provide effective  communication, especially in hospitals and emergency rooms. Examples  were provided of patients who are unable to see the video monitor  because they are semi-conscious or unable to focus on the video screen;  other examples were given of cases where the video monitor is out of the  sightline of the patient or the image is out of focus; still other  examples were given of patients who could not see the image because the  signal was interrupted, causing unnatural pauses in the communication,  or the image was grainy or otherwise unclear. Many commenters requested  more explicit guidelines on the use of VRI, and some recommended  requirements for equipment maintenance, high-speed, wide-bandwidth video  links using dedicated lines or wireless systems, and training of staff  using VRI, especially in hospital and health care situations. Several  major organizations requested a requirement to include the interpreter's  face, head, arms, hands, and eyes in all transmissions. Finally, one  State agency asked for additional guidance, outreach, and mandated  advertising about the availability of VRI in title II situations so that  local government entities would budget for and facilitate the use of VRI  in libraries, schools, and other places.</p><p class="depth0">After consideration of the comments and the Department's own  research and experience, the Department has determined that VRI can be  an effective method of providing interpreting services in certain  circumstances, but not in others. For example, VRI should be effective  in many situations involving routine medical care, as well as in the  emergency room where urgent care is important, but no in-person  interpreter is available; however, VRI may not be effective in  situations involving surgery or other medical procedures where the  patient is limited in his or her ability to see the video screen.  Similarly, VRI may not be effective in situations where there are  multiple people in a room and the information exchanged is highly  complex and fast-paced. The Department recognizes that in these and  other situations, such as where communication is needed for persons who  are deaf-blind, it may be necessary to summon an in-person interpreter  to assist certain individuals. To ensure that VRI is effective in  situations where   it is appropriate, the Department has established performance standards  in Sec.  35.160(d).</p><p class="depth0">Subpart B--General Requirements</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.130(h) Safety.</p><p class="depth0">Section 36.301(b) of the 1991 title III regulation provides that a  public accommodation ``may impose legitimate safety requirements that  are necessary for safe operation. Safety requirements must be based on  actual risks, and not on mere speculation, stereotypes, or  generalizations about individuals with disabilities.'' 28 CFR 36.301(b).  Although the 1991 title II regulation did not include similar language,  the Department's 1993 ADA Title II Technical Assistance Manual at II- 3.5200 makes clear the Department's view that public entities also have  the right to impose legitimate safety requirements necessary for the  safe operation of services, programs, or activities. To ensure  consistency between the title II and title III regulations, the  Department has added a new Sec.  35.130(h) in the final rule  incorporating this longstanding position relating to imposition of  legitimate safety requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.133 Maintenance of accessible features.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.133 in the 1991 title II regulation provides that a  public entity must maintain in operable working condition those features  of facilities and equipment that are required to be readily accessible  to and usable by qualified individuals with disabilities. See 28 CFR  35.133(a). In the NPRM, the Department clarified the application of this  provision and proposed one change to the section to address the discrete  situation in which the scoping requirements provided in the 2010  Standards reduce the number of required elements below the requirements  of the 1991 Standards. In that discrete event, a public entity may  reduce such accessible features in accordance with the requirements in  the 2010 Standards.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received only four comments on this proposed  amendment. None of the commenters opposed the change. In the final rule,  the Department has revised the section to make it clear that if the 2010  Standards reduce either the technical requirements or the number of  required accessible elements below that required by the 1991 Standards,  then the public entity may reduce the technical requirements or the  number of accessible elements in a covered facility in accordance with  the requirements of the 2010 Standards.</p><p class="depth0">One commenter urged the Department to amend Sec.  35.133(b) to  expand the language of the section to restocking of shelves as a  permissible activity for isolated or temporary interruptions in service  or access. It is the Department's position that a temporary interruption  that blocks an accessible route, such as restocking of shelves, is  already permitted by Sec.  35.133(b), which clarifies that ``isolated or  temporary interruptions in service or access due to maintenance or  repairs'' are permitted. Therefore, the Department will not make any  additional changes in the final rule to the language of Sec.  35.133(b)  other than those discussed in the preceding paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.136 Service animals.</p><p class="depth0">The 1991 title II regulation states that ``[a] public entity shall  make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when  the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of  disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the  modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,  program or activity.'' 28 CFR 130(b)(7). Unlike the title III  regulation, the 1991 title II regulation did not contain a specific  provision addressing service animals.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department stated the intention of providing the  broadest feasible access to individuals with disabilities and their  service animals, unless a public entity can demonstrate that making the  modifications to policies excluding animals would fundamentally alter  the nature of the public entity's service, program, or activity. The  Department proposed creating a new Sec.  35.136 addressing service  animals that was intended to retain the scope of the 1991 title III  regulation at Sec.  36.302(c), while clarifying the Department's  longstanding policies and interpretations, as outlined in published  technical assistance, Commonly Asked Questions About Service Animals in  Places of Business (1996), available at http://www.ada.gov/qasrvc.ftm  and ADA Guide for Small Businesses (1999), available at http:// www.ada.gov/smbustxt.htm, and to add that a public entity may exclude a  service animal in certain circumstances where the service animal fails  to meet certain behavioral standards. The Department received extensive  comments in response to proposed Sec.  35.136 from individuals,  disability advocacy groups, organizations involved in training service  animals, and public entities. Those comments and the Department's  response are discussed below.</p><p class="depth0">Exclusion of service animals. In the NPRM, the Department proposed  incorporating the title III regulatory language of Sec.  36.302(c) into  new Sec.  35.136(a), which states that ``[g]enerally, a public entity  shall modify its policies, practices, or procedures to permit the use of  a service animal by an individual with a disability, unless the public  entity can demonstrate that the use of a service animal would  fundamentally alter the public entity's service, program, or activity.''  The final rule retains this language with some modifications.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, in the NPRM, the Department proposed clarifying those  circumstances   where otherwise eligible service animals may be excluded by public  entities from their programs or facilities. The Department proposed in  Sec.  35.136(b)(1) of the NPRM that a public entity may ask an  individual with a disability to remove a service animal from a title II  service, program, or activity if: ``[t]he animal is out of control and  the animal's handler does not take effective action to control it.'' 73  FR 34466, 34504 (June 17, 2008).</p><p class="depth0">The Department has long held that a service animal must be under the  control of the handler at all times. Commenters overwhelmingly were in  favor of this language, but noted that there are occasions when service  animals are provoked to disruptive or aggressive behavior by agitators  or troublemakers, as in the case of a blind individual whose service dog  is taunted or pinched. While all service animals are trained to ignore  and overcome these types of incidents, misbehavior in response to  provocation is not always unreasonable. In circumstances where a service  animal misbehaves or responds reasonably to a provocation or injury, the  public entity must give the handler a reasonable opportunity to gain  control of the animal. Further, if the individual with a disability  asserts that the animal was provoked or injured, or if the public entity  otherwise has reason to suspect that provocation or injury has occurred,  the public entity should seek to determine the facts and, if provocation  or injury occurred, the public entity should take effective steps to  prevent further provocation or injury, which may include asking the  provocateur to leave the public entity. This language is unchanged in  the final rule.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM also proposed language at Sec.  35.136(b)(2) to permit a  public entity to exclude a service animal if the animal is not  housebroken (i.e., trained so that, absent illness or accident, the  animal controls its waste elimination) or the animal's presence or  behavior fundamentally alters the nature of the service the public  entity provides (e.g., repeated barking during a live performance).  Several commenters were supportive of this NPRM language, but cautioned  against overreaction by the public entity in these instances. One  commenter noted that animals get sick, too, and that accidents  occasionally happen. In these circumstances, simple clean up typically  addresses the incident. Commenters noted that the public entity must be  careful when it excludes a service animal on the basis of ``fundamental  alteration,'' asserting for example that a public entity should not  exclude a service animal for barking in an environment where other types  of noise, such as loud cheering or a child crying, is tolerated. The  Department maintains that the appropriateness of an exclusion can be  assessed by reviewing how a public entity addresses comparable  situations that do not involve a service animal. The Department has  retained in Sec.  35.136(b) of the final rule the exception requiring  animals to be housebroken. The Department has not retained the specific  NPRM language stating that animals can be excluded if their presence or  behavior fundamentally alters the nature of the service provided by the  public entity, because the Department believes that this exception is  covered by the general reasonable modification requirement contained in  Sec.  35.130(b)(7).</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM also proposed at Sec.  35.136(b)(3) that a service animal  can be excluded where ``[t]he animal poses a direct threat to the health  or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable  modifications.'' 73 FR 34466, 34504 (June 17, 2008). Commenters were  universally supportive of this provision as it makes express the  discretion of a public entity to exclude a service animal that poses a  direct threat. Several commenters cautioned against the overuse of this  provision and suggested that the Department provide an example of the  rule's application. The Department has decided not to include regulatory  language specifically stating that a service animal can be excluded if  it poses a direct threat. The Department believes that the addition of  new Sec.  35.139, which incorporates the language of the title III  provisions at Sec.  36.302 relating to the general defense of direct  threat, is sufficient to establish the availability of this defense to  public entities.</p><p class="depth0">Access to a public entity following the proper exclusion of a  service animal. The NPRM proposed that in the event a public entity  properly excludes a service animal, the public entity must give the  individual with a disability the opportunity to access the programs,  services, and facilities of the public entity without the service  animal. Most commenters welcomed this provision as a common sense  approach. These commenters noted that they do not wish to preclude  individuals with disabilities from the full and equal enjoyment of the  State or local government's programs, services, or facilities, simply  because of an isolated problem with a service animal. The Department has  elected to retain this provision in Sec.  35.136(a).</p><p class="depth0">Other requirements. The NPRM also proposed that the regulation  include the following requirements: that the work or tasks performed by  the service animal must be directly related to the handler's disability;  that a service animal must be individually trained to do work or perform  a task, be housebroken, and be under the control of the handler; and  that a service animal must have a harness, leash, or other tether. Most  commenters addressed at least one of these issues in their responses.  Most agreed that these provisions are important to clarify further the  1991 service animal regulation. The Department has moved the requirement  that   the work or tasks performed by the service animal must be related  directly to the individual's disability to the definition of `service  animal' in Sec.  35.104. In addition, the Department has modified the  proposed language in Sec.  35.136(d) relating to the handler's control  of the animal with a harness, leash, or other tether to state that ``[a]  service animal shall have a harness, leash, or other tether, unless  either the handler is unable because of a disability to use a harness,  leash, or other tether, or the use of a harness, leash, or other tether  would interfere with the service animal's safe, effective performance of  work or tasks, in which case the service animal must be otherwise under  the handler's control (e.g., voice control, signals, or other effective  means).'' The Department has retained the requirement that the service  animal must be individually trained (see Appendix A discussion of Sec.   35.104, definition of ``service animal''), as well as the requirement  that the service animal be housebroken.</p><p class="depth0">Responsibility for supervision and care of a service animal. The  NPRM proposed language at Sec.  35.136(e) stating that ``[a] public  entity is not responsible for caring for or supervising a service  animal.'' 73 FR 34466, 34504 (June 17, 2008). Most commenters did not  address this particular provision. The Department recognizes that there  are occasions when a person with a disability is confined to bed in a  hospital for a period of time. In such an instance, the individual may  not be able to walk or feed the service animal. In such cases, if the  individual has a family member, friend, or other person willing to take  on these responsibilities in the place of the individual with  disabilities, the individual's obligation to be responsible for the care  and supervision of the service animal would be satisfied. The language  of this section is retained, with minor modifications, in Sec.   35.136(e) of the final rule.</p><p class="depth0">Inquiries about service animals. The NPRM proposed language at Sec.   35.136(f) setting forth parameters about how a public entity may  determine whether an animal qualifies as a service animal. The proposed  section stated that a public entity may ask if the animal is required  because of a disability and what task or work the animal has been  trained to do but may not require proof of service animal certification  or licensing. Such inquiries are limited to eliciting the information  necessary to make a decision without requiring disclosure of  confidential disability-related information that a State or local  government entity does not need. This language is consistent with the  policy guidance outlined in two Department publications, Commonly Asked  Questions about Service Animals in Places of Business (1996), available  at http://www.ada.gov/qasrvc.htm, and ADA Guide for Small Businesses,  (1999), available at http://www.ada.gov/smbustxt.htm.</p><p class="depth0">Although some commenters contended that the NPRM service animal  provisions leave unaddressed the issue of how a public entity can  distinguish between a psychiatric service animal, which is covered under  the final rule, and a comfort animal, which is not, other commenters  noted that the Department's published guidance has helped public  entities to distinguish between service animals and pets on the basis of  an individual's response to these questions. Accordingly, the Department  has retained the NPRM language incorporating its guidance concerning the  permissible questions into the final rule.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters suggested that a title II entity be allowed to  require current documentation, no more than one year old, on letterhead  from a mental health professional stating the following: (1) That the  individual seeking to use the animal has a mental health-related  disability; (2) that having the animal accompany the individual is  necessary to the individual's mental health or treatment or to assist  the person otherwise; and (3) that the person providing the assessment  of the individual is a licensed mental health professional and the  individual seeking to use the animal is under that individual's  professional care. These commenters asserted that this will prevent  abuse and ensure that individuals with legitimate needs for psychiatric  service animals may use them. The Department believes that this proposal  would treat persons with psychiatric, intellectual, and other mental  disabilities less favorably than persons with physical or sensory  disabilities. The proposal would also require persons with disabilities  to obtain medical documentation and carry it with them any time they  seek to engage in ordinary activities of daily life in their  communities--something individuals without disabilities have not been  required to do. Accordingly, the Department has concluded that a  documentation requirement of this kind would be unnecessary, burdensome,  and contrary to the spirit, intent, and mandates of the ADA.</p><p class="depth0">Areas of a public entity open to the public, participants in  services, programs, or activities, or invitees. The NPRM proposed at  Sec.  35.136(g) that an individual with a disability who uses a service  animal has the same right of access to areas of a title II entity as  members of the public, participants in services, programs, or  activities, or invitees. Commenters indicated that allowing individuals  with disabilities to go with their service animals into the same areas  as members of the public, participants in programs, services, or  activities, or invitees is accepted practice by most State and local  government entities. The Department has included a slightly modified  version of this provision in Sec.  35.136(g) of the final rule.</p><p class="depth0">The Department notes that under the final rule, a healthcare  facility must also permit a person with a disability to be accompanied  by a service animal in all areas of the facility in which that person  would otherwise be allowed. There are some exceptions, however. The  Department follows the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) on the use of service animals in a hospital setting.  Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted to humans through bites, scratches,  direct contact, arthropod vectors, or aerosols.</p><p class="depth0">Consistent with CDC guidance, it is generally appropriate to exclude  a service animal from limited-access areas that employ general  infection-control measures, such as operating rooms and burn units. See  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Guidelines for Environmental  Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities: Recommendations of CDC and  the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (June  2003), available at http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/eic--in-- HCF--03.pdf (last visited June 24, 2010). A service animal may accompany  its handler to such areas as admissions and discharge offices, the  emergency room, inpatient and outpatient rooms, examining and diagnostic  rooms, clinics, rehabilitation therapy areas, the cafeteria and vending  areas, the pharmacy, restrooms, and all other areas of the facility  where healthcare personnel, patients, and visitors are permitted without  added precaution.</p><p class="depth0">Prohibition against surcharges for use of a service animal. In the  NPRM, the Department proposed to incorporate the previously mentioned  policy guidance, which prohibits the assessment of a surcharge for the  use of a service animal, into proposed Sec.  35.136(h). Several  commenters agreed that this provision makes clear the obligation of a  public entity to admit an individual with a service animal without  surcharges, and that any additional costs imposed should be factored  into the overall cost of administering a program, service, or activity,  and passed on as a charge to all participants, rather than an  individualized surcharge to the service animal user. Commenters also  noted that service animal users cannot be required to comply with other  requirements that are not generally applicable to other persons. If a  public entity normally charges individuals for the damage they cause, an  individual with a disability may be charged for damage caused by his or  her service animal. The Department has retained this language, with  minor modifications, in the final rule at Sec.  35.136(h).</p><p class="depth0">Training requirement. Certain commenters recommended the adoption of  formal training requirements for service animals. The Department has  rejected this approach and will not impose any type of formal training  requirements or certification process, but will continue to require that  service animals be individually trained to do work or perform tasks for  the benefit of an individual with a disability. While some groups have  urged the Department to modify this position, the Department has  determined that such a modification would not serve the full array of  individuals with disabilities who use service animals, since individuals  with disabilities may be capable of training, and some have trained,  their service animal to perform tasks or do work to accommodate their  disability. A training and certification requirement would increase the  expense of acquiring a service animal and might limit access to service  animals for individuals with limited financial resources.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters proposed specific behavior or training standards for  service animals, arguing that without such standards, the public has no  way to differentiate between untrained pets and service animals. Many of  the suggested behavior or training standards were lengthy and detailed.  The Department believes that this rule addresses service animal behavior  sufficiently by including provisions that address the obligations of the  service animal user and the circumstances under which a service animal  may be excluded, such as the requirements that an animal be housebroken  and under the control of its handler.</p><p class="depth0">Miniature horses. The Department has been persuaded by commenters  and the available research to include a provision that would require  public entities to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices,  or procedures to permit the use of a miniature horse by a person with a  disability if the miniature horse has been individually trained to do  work or perform tasks for the benefit of the individual with a  disability. The traditional service animal is a dog, which has a long  history of guiding individuals who are blind or have low vision, and  over time dogs have been trained to perform an even wider variety of  services for individuals with all types of disabilities. However, an  organization that developed a program to train miniature horses, modeled  on the program used for guide dogs, began training miniature horses in  1991.</p><p class="depth0">Although commenters generally supported the species limitations  proposed in the NPRM, some were opposed to the exclusion of miniature  horses from the definition of a service animal. These commenters noted  that these animals have been providing assistance to persons with  disabilities for many years. Miniature horses were suggested by some  commenters as viable alternatives to dogs for individuals with  allergies, or for those whose religious beliefs preclude the use of  dogs. Another consideration mentioned in favor of the use of miniature  horses is the longer life span and strength of miniature horses in  comparison to dogs. Specifically, miniature horses can provide service   for more than 25 years while dogs can provide service for approximately  7 years, and, because of their strength, miniature horses can provide  services that dogs cannot provide. Accordingly, use of miniature horses  reduces the cost involved to retire, replace, and train replacement  service animals.</p><p class="depth0">The miniature horse is not one specific breed, but may be one of  several breeds, with distinct characteristics that produce animals  suited to service animal work. The animals generally range in height  from 24 inches to 34 inches measured to the withers, or shoulders, and  generally weigh between 70 and 100 pounds. These characteristics are  similar to those of large breed dogs such as Labrador Retrievers, Great  Danes, and Mastiffs. Similar to dogs, miniature horses can be trained  through behavioral reinforcement to be ``housebroken.'' Most miniature  service horse handlers and organizations recommend that when the animals  are not doing work or performing tasks, the miniature horses should be  kept outside in a designated area, instead of indoors in a house.</p><p class="depth0">According to information provided by an organization that trains  service horses, these miniature horses are trained to provide a wide  array of services to their handlers, primarily guiding individuals who  are blind or have low vision, pulling wheelchairs, providing stability  and balance for individuals with disabilities that impair the ability to  walk, and supplying leverage that enables a person with a mobility  disability to get up after a fall. According to the commenter, miniature  horses are particularly effective for large stature individuals. The  animals can be trained to stand (and in some cases, lie down) at the  handler's feet in venues where space is at a premium, such as assembly  areas or inside some vehicles that provide public transportation. Some  individuals with disabilities have traveled by train and have flown  commercially with their miniature horses.</p><p class="depth0">The miniature horse is not included in the definition of service  animal, which is limited to dogs. However, the Department has added a  specific provision at Sec.  35.136(i) of the final rule covering  miniature horses. Under this provision, a public entity must make  reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures to permit  the use of a miniature horse by an individual with a disability if the  miniature horse has been individually trained to do work or perform  tasks for the benefit of the individual with a disability. The public  entity may take into account a series of assessment factors in  determining whether to allow a miniature horse into a specific facility.  These include the type, size, and weight of the miniature horse; whether  the handler has sufficient control of the miniature horse; whether the  miniature horse is housebroken; and whether the miniature horse's  presence in a specific facility compromises legitimate safety  requirements that are necessary for safe operation. In addition,  paragraphs (c)-(h) of this section, which are applicable to dogs, also  apply to miniature horses.</p><p class="depth0">Ponies and full-size horses are not covered by Sec.  35.136(i).  Also, because miniature horses can vary in size and can be larger and  less flexible than dogs, covered entities may exclude this type of  service animal if the presence of the miniature horse, because of its  larger size and lower level of flexibility, results in a fundamental  alteration to the nature of the programs activities, or services  provided.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.137 Mobility devices.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.137 of the NPRM clarified the scope and circumstances  under which covered entities are legally obligated to accommodate  various ``mobility devices.'' Section 35.137 set forth specific  requirements for the accommodation of ``mobility devices,'' including  wheelchairs, manually-powered mobility aids, and other power-driven  mobility devices.</p><p class="depth0">In both the NPRM and the final rule, Sec.  35.137(a) states the  general rule that in any areas open to pedestrians, public entities  shall permit individuals with mobility disabilities to use wheelchairs  and manually-powered mobility aids, including walkers, crutches, canes,  braces, or similar devices. Because mobility scooters satisfy the  definition of ``wheelchair'' (i.e., ``manually-operated or power-driven  device designed primarily for use by an individual with a mobility  disability for the main purpose of indoor, or of both indoor and outdoor  locomotion''), the reference to them in Sec.  35.137(a) of the final  rule has been omitted to avoid redundancy.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters expressed concern that permitting the use of other  power-driven mobility devices by individuals with mobility disabilities  would make such devices akin to wheelchairs and would require them to  make physical changes to their facilities to accommodate their use. This  concern is misplaced. If a facility complies with the applicable design  requirements in the 1991 Standards or the 2010 Standards, the public  entity will not be required to exceed those standards to accommodate the  use of wheelchairs or other power-driven mobility devices that exceed  those requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Legal standard for other power-driven mobility devices. The NPRM  version of Sec.  35.137(b) provided that ``[a] public entity shall make  reasonable modifications in its policies, practices, and procedures to  permit the use of other power-driven mobility devices by individuals  with disabilities, unless the public entity can demonstrate that the use  of the device is not reasonable or that its use will result in a  fundamental alteration in the   public entity's service, program, or activity.'' 73 FR 34466, 34505  (June 17, 2008). In other words, public entities are by default required  to permit the use of other power-driven mobility devices; the burden is  on them to prove the existence of a valid exception.</p><p class="depth0">Most commenters supported the notion of assessing whether the use of  a particular device is reasonable in the context of a particular venue.  Commenters, however, disagreed about the meaning of the word  ``reasonable'' as it is used in Sec.  35.137(b) of the NPRM. Advocacy  and nonprofit groups almost universally objected to the use of a general  reasonableness standard with regard to the assessment of whether a  particular device should be allowed at a particular venue. They argued  that the assessment should be based on whether reasonable modifications  could be made to allow a particular device at a particular venue, and  that the only factors that should be part of the calculus that results  in the exclusion of a particular device are undue burden, direct threat,  and fundamental alteration.</p><p class="depth0">A few commenters opposed the proposed provision requiring public  entities to assess whether reasonable modifications can be made to allow  other power-driven mobility devices, preferring instead that the  Department issue guidance materials so that public entities would not  have to incur the cost of such analyses. Another commenter noted a ``fox  guarding the hen house''-type of concern with regard to public entities  developing and enforcing their own modification policy.</p><p class="depth0">In response to comments received, the Department has revised Sec.   35.137(b) to provide greater clarity regarding the development of  legitimate safety requirements regarding other power-driven mobility  devices and has added a new Sec.  35.130(h) (Safety) to the title II  regulation which specifically permits public entities to impose  legitimate safety requirements necessary for the safe operation of their  services, programs, and activities. (See discussion below.) The  Department has not retained the proposed NPRM language stating that an  other power-driven mobility device can be excluded if a public entity  can demonstrate that its use is unreasonable or will result in a  fundamental alteration of the entity's service, program, or activity,  because the Department believes that this exception is covered by the  general reasonable modification requirement contained in Sec.   35.130(b)(7).</p><p class="depth0">Assessment factors. Section 35.137(c) of the NPRM required public  entities to ``establish policies to permit the use of other power-driven  mobility devices'' and articulated four factors upon which public  entities must base decisions as to whether a modification is reasonable  to allow the use of a class of other power-driven mobility devices by  individuals with disabilities in specific venues (e.g., parks,  courthouses, office buildings, etc.). 73 FR 34466, 34504 (June 17,  2008).</p><p class="depth0">The Department has relocated and modified the NPRM text that  appeared in Sec.  35.137(c) to new paragraph Sec.  35.137(b)(2) to  clarify what factors the public entity shall use in determining whether  a particular other power-driven mobility device can be allowed in a  specific facility as a reasonable modification. Section 35.137(b)(2) now  states that ``[i]n determining whether a particular other power-driven  mobility device can be allowed in a specific facility as a reasonable  modification under (b)(1), a public entity shall consider'' certain  enumerated factors. The assessment factors are designed to assist public  entities in determining whether allowing the use of a particular other  power-driven mobility device in a specific facility is reasonable. Thus,  the focus of the analysis must be on the appropriateness of the use of  the device at a specific facility, rather than whether it is necessary  for an individual to use a particular device.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM proposed the following specific assessment factors: (1) The  dimensions, weight, and operating speed of the mobility device in  relation to a wheelchair; (2) the potential risk of harm to others by  the operation of the mobility device; (3) the risk of harm to the  environment or natural or cultural resources or conflict with Federal  land management laws and regulations; and (4) the ability of the public  entity to stow the mobility device when not in use, if requested by the  user.</p><p class="depth0">Factor 1 was designed to help public entities assess whether a  particular device was appropriate, given its particular physical  features, for a particular location. Virtually all commenters said the  physical features of the device affected their view of whether a  particular device was appropriate for a particular location. For  example, while many commenters supported the use of another power-driven  mobility device if the device were a Segway[supreg] PT, because of  environmental and health concerns they did not offer the same level of  support if the device were an off-highway vehicle, all-terrain vehicle  (ATV), golf car, or other device with a fuel-powered or combustion  engine. Most commenters noted that indicators such as speed, weight, and  dimension really were an assessment of the appropriateness of a  particular device in specific venues and suggested that factor 1 say  this more specifically.</p><p class="depth0">The term ``in relation to a wheelchair'' in the NPRM's factor 1  apparently created some concern that the same legal standards that apply  to wheelchairs would be applied to other power-driven mobility devices.  The Department has omitted the term ``in relation to a wheelchair'' from  Sec.  35.137(b)(2)(i) to   clarify that if a facility that is in compliance with the applicable  provisions of the 1991 Standards or the 2010 Standards grants permission  for an other power-driven mobility device to go on-site, it is not  required to exceed those standards to accommodate the use of other  power-driven mobility devices.</p><p class="depth0">In response to requests that NPRM factor 1 state more specifically  that it requires an assessment of an other power-driven mobility  device's appropriateness under particular circumstances or in particular  venues, the Department has added several factors and more specific  language. In addition, although the NPRM made reference to the operation  of other power-driven mobility devices in ``specific venues,'' the  Department's intent is captured more clearly by referencing ``specific  facility'' in paragraph (b)(2). The Department also notes that while  speed is included in factor 1, public entities should not rely solely on  a device's top speed when assessing whether the device can be  accommodated; instead, public entities should also consider the minimum  speeds at which a device can be operated and whether the development of  speed limit policies can be established to address concerns regarding  the speed of the device. Finally, since the ability of the public entity  to stow the mobility device when not in use is an aspect of its design  and operational characteristics, the text proposed as factor 4 in the  NPRM has been incorporated in paragraph (b)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM's version of factor 2 provided that the ``risk of potential  harm to others by the operation of the mobility device'' is one of the  determinants in the assessment of whether other power-driven mobility  devices should be excluded from a site. The Department intended this  requirement to be consistent with the Department's longstanding  interpretation, expressed in Sec.  II-3.5200 (Safety) of the 1993 Title  II Technical Assistance Manual, which provides that public entities may  ``impose legitimate safety requirements that are necessary for safe  operation.'' (This language parallels the provision in the title III  regulation at Sec.  36.301(b).) However, several commenters indicated  that they read this language, particularly the phrase ``risk of  potential harm,'' to mean that the Department had adopted a concept of  risk analysis different from that which is in the existing standards.  The Department did not intend to create a new standard and has changed  the language in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) to clarify the applicable  standards, thereby avoiding the introduction of new assessments of risk  beyond those necessary for the safe operation of the public entity. In  addition, the Department has added a new section, 35.130(h), which  incorporates the existing safety standard into the title II regulation.</p><p class="depth0">While all applicable affirmative defenses are available to public  entities in the establishment and execution of their policies regarding  other power-driven mobility devices, the Department did not explicitly  incorporate the direct threat defense into the assessment factors  because Sec.  35.130(h) provides public entities the appropriate  framework with which to assess whether legitimate safety requirements  that may preclude the use of certain other power-driven mobility devices  are necessary for the safe operation of the public entities. In order to  be legitimate, the safety requirement must be based on actual risks and  not mere speculation regarding the device or how it will be operated. Of  course, public entities may enforce legitimate safety rules established  by the public entity for the operation of other power-driven mobility  devices (e.g., reasonable speed restrictions). Finally, NPRM factor 3  concerning environmental resources and conflicts of law has been  relocated to Sec.  35.137(b)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0">As a result of these comments and requests, NPRM factors 1, 2, 3,  and 4 have been revised and renumbered within paragraph (b)(2) in the  final rule.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters requested that the Department provide guidance  materials or more explicit concepts of which considerations might be  appropriate for inclusion in a policy that allows the use of other  power-driven mobility devices. A public entity that has determined that  reasonable modifications can be made in its policies, practices, or  procedures to allow the use of other power-driven mobility devices  should develop a policy that clearly states the circumstances under  which the use of other power-driven mobility devices by individuals with  a mobility disability will be permitted. It also should include clear,  concise statements of specific rules governing the operation of such  devices. Finally, the public entity should endeavor to provide  individuals with disabilities who use other power-driven mobility  devices with advanced notice of its policy regarding the use of such  devices and what rules apply to the operation of these devices.</p><p class="depth0">For example, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) has  developed a policy allowing the use of the Segway[supreg] PT and other  EPAMDs in all Federal buildings under GSA's jurisdiction. See General  Services Administration, Interim Segway[supreg] Personal Transporter  Policy (Dec. 3, 2007), available at http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/ Interim--Segway--Policy--121007.pdf (last visited June 24, 2010). The  GSA policy defines the policy's scope of coverage by setting out what  devices are and are not covered by the policy. The policy also sets out  requirements for safe operation, such as a speed limit, prohibits the  use of EPAMDs on escalators, and provides guidance regarding security  screening of these devices and their operators.</p><p class="depth0">A public entity that determines that it can make reasonable  modifications to permit the use of an other power-driven mobility device  by an individual with a mobility disability might include in its policy  the procedure by which claims that the other power-driven mobility  device is being used for a mobility disability will be assessed for  legitimacy (i.e., a credible assurance that the device is being used for  a mobility disability, including a verbal representation by the person  with a disability that is not contradicted by observable fact, or the  presentation of a disability parking space placard or card, or State- issued proof of disability); the type or classes of other power-driven  mobility devices are permitted to be used by individuals with mobility  disabilities; the size, weight, and dimensions of the other power-driven  mobility devices that are permitted to be used by individuals with  mobility disabilities; the speed limit for the other power-driven  mobility devices that are permitted to be used by individuals with  mobility disabilities; the places, times, or circumstances under which  the use of the other power-driven mobility device is or will be  restricted or prohibited; safety, pedestrian, and other rules concerning  the use of the other power-driven mobility device; whether, and under  which circumstances, storage for the other power-driven mobility device  will be made available; and how and where individuals with a mobility  disability can obtain a copy of the other power-driven mobility device  policy.</p><p class="depth0">Public entities also might consider grouping other power-driven  mobility devices by type (e.g., EPAMDs, golf cars, gasoline-powered  vehicles, and other devices). For example, an amusement park may  determine that it is reasonable to allow individuals with disabilities  to use EPAMDs in a variety of outdoor programs and activities, but that  it would not be reasonable to allow the use of golf cars as mobility  devices in similar circumstances. At the same time, the entity may  address its concerns about factors such as space limitations by  disallowing use of EPAMDs by members of the general public who do not  have mobility disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">The Department anticipates that, in many circumstances, public  entities will be able to develop policies that will allow the use of  other power-driven mobility devices by individuals with mobility  disabilities. Consider the following example:</p><p class="depth0">A county courthouse has developed a policy whereby EPAMDs may be  operated in the pedestrian areas of the courthouse if the operator of  the device agrees not to operate the device faster than pedestrians are  walking; to yield to pedestrians; to provide a rack or stand so that the  device can stand upright; and to use the device only in courtrooms that  are large enough to accommodate such devices. If the individual is  selected for jury duty in one of the smaller courtrooms, the county's  policy indicates that if it is not possible for the individual with the  disability to park the device and walk into the courtroom, the location  of the trial will be moved to a larger courtroom.</p><p class="depth0">Inquiry into the use of other power-driven mobility device. The NPRM  version of Sec.  35.137(d) provided that ``[a] public entity may ask a  person using a power-driven mobility device if the mobility device is  needed due to the person's disability. A public entity shall not ask a  person using a mobility device questions about the nature and extent of  the person's disability.'' 73 FR 34466, 34504 (June 17, 2008).</p><p class="depth0">Many environmental, transit system, and government commenters  expressed concern about people feigning mobility disabilities to be able  to use other power-driven mobility devices in public entities in which  their use is otherwise restricted. These commenters felt that a mere  inquiry into whether the device is being used for a mobility disability  was an insufficient mechanism by which to detect fraud by other power- driven mobility device users who do not have mobility disabilities.  These commenters believed they should be given more latitude to make  inquiries of other power-driven mobility device users claiming a  mobility disability than they would be given for wheelchair users. They  sought the ability to establish a policy or method by which public  entities may assess the legitimacy of the mobility disability. They  suggested some form of certification, sticker, or other designation. One  commenter suggested a requirement that a sticker bearing the  international symbol for accessibility be placed on the device or that  some other identification be required to signal that the use of the  device is for a mobility disability. Other suggestions included  displaying a disability parking placard on the device or issuing EPAMDs,  like the Segway[supreg] PT, a permit that would be similar to permits  associated with parking spaces reserved for those with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Advocacy, nonprofit, and several individual commenters balked at the  notion of allowing any inquiry beyond whether the device is necessary  for a mobility disability and encouraged the Department to retain the  NPRM's language on this topic. Other commenters, however, were  empathetic with commenters who had concerns about fraud. At least one  Segway[supreg] PT advocate suggested it would be permissible to seek  documentation of the mobility disability in the form of a simple sign or  permit.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has sought to find common ground by balancing the  needs of public entities and individuals with mobility disabilities  wishing to use other power-driven mobility devices with the Department's  longstanding, well-established policy of not allowing public entities or  establishments to   require proof of a mobility disability. There is no question that public  entities have a legitimate interest in ferreting out fraudulent  representations of mobility disabilities, especially given the  recreational use of other power-driven mobility devices and the  potential safety concerns created by having too many such devices in a  specific facility at one time. However, the privacy of individuals with  mobility disabilities and respect for those individuals, is also vitally  important.</p><p class="depth0">Neither Sec.  35.137(d) of the NPRM nor Sec.  35.137(c) of the final  rule permits inquiries into the nature of a person's mobility  disability. However, the Department does not believe it is unreasonable  or overly intrusive for an individual with a mobility disability seeking  to use an other power-driven mobility device to provide a credible  assurance to verify that the use of the other power-driven mobility  device is for a mobility disability. The Department sought to minimize  the amount of discretion and subjectivity exercised by public entities  in assessing whether an individual has a mobility disability and to  allow public entities to verify the existence of a mobility disability.  The solution was derived from comments made by several individuals who  said they have been admitted with their Segway[supreg] PTs into public  entities and public accommodations that ordinarily do not allow these  devices on-site when they have presented or displayed State-issued  disability parking placards. In the examples provided by commenters, the  parking placards were accepted as verification that the Segway[supreg]  PTs were being used as mobility devices.</p><p class="depth0">Because many individuals with mobility disabilities avail themselves  of State programs that issue disability parking placards or cards and  because these programs have penalties for fraudulent representations of  identity and disability, utilizing the parking placard system as a means  to establish the existence of a mobility disability strikes a balance  between the need for privacy of the individual and fraud protection for  the public entity. Consequently, the Department has decided to include  regulatory text in Sec.  35.137(c)(2) of the final rule that requires  public entities to accept the presentation of a valid, State-issued  disability parking placard or card, or State-issued proof of disability,  as verification that an individual uses the other power-driven mobility  device for his or her mobility disability. A ``valid'' disability  placard or card is one that is presented by the individual to whom it  was issued and is otherwise in compliance with the State of issuance's  requirements for disability placards or cards. Public entities are  required to accept a valid, State-issued disability parking placard or  card, or State-issued proof of disability as a credible assurance, but  they cannot demand or require the presentation of a valid disability  placard or card, or State-issued proof of disability, as a prerequisite  for use of an other power-driven mobility device, because not all  persons with mobility disabilities have such means of proof. If an  individual with a mobility disability does not have such a placard or  card, or State-issued proof of disability, he or she may present other  information that would serve as a credible assurance of the existence of  a mobility disability.</p><p class="depth0">In lieu of a valid, State-issued disability parking placard or card,  or State-issued proof of disability, a verbal representation, not  contradicted by observable fact, shall be accepted as a credible  assurance that the other power-driven mobility device is being used  because of a mobility disability. This does not mean, however, that a  mobility disability must be observable as a condition for allowing the  use of an other power-driven mobility device by an individual with a  mobility disability, but rather that if an individual represents that a  device is being used for a mobility disability and that individual is  observed thereafter engaging in a physical activity that is contrary to  the nature of the represented disability, the assurance given is no  longer credible and the individual may be prevented from using the  device.</p><p class="depth0">Possession of a valid, State-issued disability parking placard or  card or a verbal assurance does not trump a public entity's valid  restrictions on the use of other power-driven mobility devices.  Accordingly, a credible assurance that the other power-driven mobility  device is being used because of a mobility disability is not a guarantee  of entry to a public entity because, notwithstanding such credible  assurance, use of the device in a particular venue may be at odds with  the legal standard in Sec.  35.137(b)(1) or with one or more of the  Sec.  35.137(b)(2) factors. Only after an individual with a disability  has satisfied all of the public entity's policies regarding the use of  other power-driven mobility devices does a credible assurance become a  factor in allowing the use of the device. For example, if an individual  seeking to use an other power-driven mobility device fails to satisfy  any of the public entity's stated policies regarding the use of other  power-driven mobility devices, the fact that the individual legitimately  possesses and presents a valid, State-issued disability parking placard  or card, or State-issued proof of disability, does not trump the policy  and require the public entity to allow the use of the device. In fact,  in some instances, the presentation of a legitimately held placard or  card, or State-issued proof of disability, will have no relevance or  bearing at all on whether the other power-driven mobility device may be  used, because the public entity's policy does not permit the device in  question on-site under any circumstances (e.g., because its use would  create a substantial risk   of serious harm to the immediate environment or natural or cultural  resources). Thus, an individual with a mobility disability who presents  a valid disability placard or card, or State-issued proof of disability,  will not be able to use an ATV as an other power-driven mobility device  in a State park if the State park has adopted a policy banning their use  for any or all of the above-mentioned reasons. However, if a public  entity permits the use of a particular other power-driven mobility  device, it cannot refuse to admit an individual with a disability who  uses that device if the individual has provided a credible assurance  that the use of the device is for a mobility disability.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.138 Ticketing</p><p class="depth0">The 1991 title II regulation did not contain specific regulatory  language on ticketing. The ticketing policies and practices of public  entities, however, are subject to title II's nondiscrimination  provisions. Through the investigation of complaints, enforcement  actions, and public comments related to ticketing, the Department became  aware that some venue operators, ticket sellers, and distributors were  violating title II's nondiscrimination mandate by not providing  individuals with disabilities the same opportunities to purchase tickets  for accessible seating as they provided to spectators purchasing  conventional seats. In the NPRM, the Department proposed Sec.  35.138 to  provide explicit direction and guidance on discriminatory practices for  entities involved in the sale or distribution of tickets.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received comments from advocacy groups, assembly area  trade associations, public entities, and individuals. Many commenters  supported the addition of regulatory language pertaining to ticketing  and urged the Department to retain it in the final rule. Several  commenters, however, questioned why there were inconsistencies between  the title II and title III provisions and suggested that the same  language be used for both titles. The Department has decided to retain  ticketing regulatory language and to ensure consistency between the  ticketing provisions in title II and title III.</p><p class="depth0">Because many in the ticketing industry view season tickets and other  multi-event packages differently from individual tickets, the Department  bifurcated some season ticket provisions from those concerning single- event tickets in the NPRM. This structure, however, resulted in some  provisions being repeated for both types of tickets but not for others  even though they were intended to apply to both types of tickets. The  result was that it was not entirely clear that some of the provisions  that were not repeated also were intended to apply to season tickets.  The Department is addressing the issues raised by these commenters using  a different approach. For the purposes of this section, a single event  refers to an individual performance for which tickets may be purchased.  In contrast, a series of events includes, but is not limited to,  subscription events, event packages, season tickets, or any other  tickets that may be purchased for multiple events of the same type over  the course of a specified period of time whose ownership right reverts  to the public entity at the end of each season or time period. Series- of-events tickets that give their holders an enhanced ability to  purchase such tickets from the public entity in seasons or periods of  time that follow, such as a right of first refusal or higher ranking on  waiting lists for more desirable seats, are subject to the provisions in  this section. In addition, the final rule merges together some NPRM  paragraphs that dealt with related topics and has reordered and renamed  some of the paragraphs that were in the NPRM.</p><p class="depth0">Ticket sales. In the NPRM, the Department proposed, in Sec.   35.138(a), a general rule that a public entity shall modify its  policies, practices, or procedures to ensure that individuals with  disabilities can purchase tickets for accessible seating for an event or  series of events in the same way as others (i.e., during the same hours  and through the same distribution methods as other seating is sold). 73  FR 34466, 34504 (June 17, 2008). ``Accessible seating'' is defined in  Sec.  35.138(a)(1) of the final rule to mean ``wheelchair spaces and  companion seats that comply with sections 221 and 802 of the 2010  Standards along with any other seats required to be offered for sale to  the individual with a disability pursuant to paragraph (d) of this  section.'' The defined term does not include designated aisle seats. A  ``wheelchair space'' refers to a space for a single wheelchair and its  occupant.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM proposed requiring that accessible seats be sold through  the ``same methods of distribution'' as non-accessible seats. Comments  from venue managers and others in the business community, in general,  noted that multiple parties are involved in ticketing, and because  accessible seats may not be allotted to all parties involved at each  stage, such parties should be protected from liability. For example, one  commenter noted that a third-party ticket vendor, like Ticketmaster, can  only sell the tickets it receives from its client. Because Sec.   35.138(a)(2)(iii) of the final rule requires venue operators to make  available accessible seating through the same methods of distribution  they use for their regular tickets, venue operators that provide tickets  to third-party ticket vendors are required to provide accessible seating  to the third-party ticket vendor. This provision will enhance third- party ticket vendors' ability to acquire and sell accessible seating for  sale in the future. The Department notes that once third-   party ticket vendors acquire accessible tickets, they are obligated to  sell them in accordance with these rules.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also has received frequent complaints that  individuals with disabilities have not been able to purchase accessible  seating over the Internet, and instead have had to engage in a laborious  process of calling a customer service line, or sending an e-mail to a  customer service representative and waiting for a response. Not only is  such a process burdensome, but it puts individuals with disabilities at  a disadvantage in purchasing tickets for events that are popular and may  sell out in minutes. Because Sec.  35.138(e) of the final rule  authorizes venues to release accessible seating in case of a sell-out,  individuals with disabilities effectively could be cut off from buying  tickets unless they also have the ability to purchase tickets in real  time over the Internet. The Department's new regulatory language is  designed to address this problem.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters representing assembly areas raised concerns about  offering accessible seating for sale over the Internet. They contended  that this approach would increase the incidence of fraud since anyone  easily could purchase accessible seating over the Internet. They also  asserted that it would be difficult technologically to provide  accessible seating for sale in real time over the Internet, or that to  do so would require simplifying the rules concerning the purchase of  multiple additional accompanying seats. Moreover, these commenters  argued that requiring an individual purchasing accessible seating to  speak with a customer service representative would allow the venue to  meet the patron's needs most appropriately and ensure that wheelchair  spaces are reserved for individuals with disabilities who require  wheelchair spaces. Finally, these commenters argued that individuals who  can transfer effectively and conveniently from a wheelchair to a seat  with a movable armrest seat could instead purchase designated aisle  seats.</p><p class="depth0">The Department considered these concerns carefully and has decided  to continue with the general approach proposed in the NPRM. Although  fraud is an important concern, the Department believes that it is best  combated by other means that would not have the effect of limiting the  ability of individuals with disabilities to purchase tickets,  particularly since restricting the purchase of accessible seating over  the Internet will, of itself, not curb fraud. In addition, the  Department has identified permissible means for covered entities to  reduce the incidence of fraudulent accessible seating ticket purchases  in Sec.  35.138(h) of the final rule.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters questioned whether ticket websites themselves  must be accessible to individuals who are blind or have low vision, and  if so, what that requires. The Department has consistently interpreted  the ADA to cover websites that are operated by public entities and  stated that such sites must provide their services in an accessible  manner or provide an accessible alternative to the website that is  available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The final rule, therefore,  does not impose any new obligation in this area. The accessibility of  websites is discussed in more detail in the section of Appendix A  entitled ``Other Issues.''</p><p class="depth0">In Sec.  35.138(b) of the NPRM, the Department also proposed  requiring public entities to make accessible seating available during  all stages of tickets sales including, but not limited to, presales,  promotions, lotteries, waitlists, and general sales. For example, if  tickets will be presold for an event that is open only to members of a  fan club, or to holders of a particular credit card, then tickets for  accessible seating must be made available for purchase through those  means. This requirement does not mean that any individual with a  disability would be able to purchase those seats. Rather, it means that  an individual with a disability who meets the requirement for such a  sale (e.g., who is a member of the fan club or holds that credit card)  will be able to participate in the special promotion and purchase  accessible seating. The Department has maintained the substantive  provisions of the NPRM's Sec.  35.138(a) and (b) but has combined them  in a single paragraph at Sec.  35.138(a)(2) of the final rule so that  all of the provisions having to do with the manner in which tickets are  sold are located in a single paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">Identification of available accessible seating. In the NPRM, the  Department proposed Sec.  35.138(c), which, as modified and renumbered  as paragraph (b)(3) in the final rule, requires a facility to identify  available accessible seating through seating maps, brochures, or other  methods if that information is made available about other seats sold to  the general public. This rule requires public entities to provide  information about accessible seating to the same degree of specificity  that it provides information about general seating. For example, if a  seating map displays color-coded blocks pegged to prices for general  seating, then accessible seating must be similarly color-coded.  Likewise, if covered entities provide detailed maps that show exact  seating and pricing for general seating, they must provide the same for  accessible seating.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM did not specify a requirement to identify prices for  accessible seating. The final rule requires that if such information is  provided for general seating, it must be provided for accessible seating  as well.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed in Sec.  35.138(d) that a  public entity, upon being asked, must inform persons with disabilities  and their companions of the locations of all unsold or otherwise  available seating. This   provision is intended to prevent the practice of ``steering''  individuals with disabilities to certain accessible seating so that the  facility can maximize potential ticket sales by releasing unsold  accessible seating, especially in preferred or desirable locations, for  sale to the general public. The Department received no significant  comment on this proposal. The Department has retained this provision in  the final rule but has added it, with minor modifications, to Sec.   35.138(b) as paragraph (1).</p><p class="depth0">Ticket prices. In the NPRM, the Department proposed Sec.  35.138(e)  requiring that ticket prices for accessible seating be set no higher  than the prices for other seats in that seating section for that event.  The NPRM's provision also required that accessible seating be made  available at every price range, and if an existing facility has barriers  to accessible seating within a particular price range, a proportionate  amount of seating (determined by the ratio of the total number of seats  at that price level to the total number of seats in the assembly area)  must be offered in an accessible location at that same price. Under this  rule, for example, if a public entity has a 20,000-seat facility built  in 1980 with inaccessible seating in the $20-price category, which is on  the upper deck, and it chooses not to put accessible seating in that  section, then it must place a proportionate number of seats in an  accessible location for $20. If the upper deck has 2,000 seats, then the  facility must place 10 percent of its accessible seating in an  accessible location for $20 provided that it is part of a seating  section where ticket prices are equal to or more than $20--a facility  may not place the $20-accessible seating in a $10-seating section. The  Department received no significant comment on this rule, and it has been  retained, as amended, in the final rule in Sec.  35.138(c).</p><p class="depth0">Purchase of multiple tickets. In the NPRM, the Department proposed  Sec.  35.138(i) to address one of the most common ticketing complaints  raised with the Department: That individuals with disabilities are not  able to purchase more than two tickets. The Department proposed this  provision to facilitate the ability of individuals with disabilities to  attend events with friends, companions, or associates who may or may not  have a disability by enabling individuals with disabilities to purchase  the maximum number of tickets allowed per transaction to other  spectators; by requiring venues to place accompanying individuals in  general seating as close as possible to accessible seating (in the event  that a group must be divided because of the large size of the group);  and by allowing an individual with a disability to purchase up to three  additional contiguous seats per wheelchair space if they are available  at the time of sale. Section 35.138(i)(2) of the NPRM required that a  group containing one or more wheelchair users must be placed together,  if possible, and that in the event that the group could not be placed  together, the individuals with disabilities may not be isolated from the  rest of the group.</p><p class="depth0">The Department asked in the NPRM whether this rule was sufficient to  effectuate the integration of individuals with disabilities. Many  advocates and individuals praised it as a welcome and much-needed  change, stating that the trade-off of being able to sit with their  family or friends was worth reducing the number of seats available for  individuals with disabilities. Some commenters went one step further and  suggested that the number of additional accompanying seats should not be  restricted to three.</p><p class="depth0">Although most of the substance of the proposed provision on the  purchase of multiple tickets has been maintained in the final rule, it  has been renumbered as Sec.  35.138(d), reorganized, and supplemented.  To preserve the availability of accessible seating for other individuals  with disabilities, the Department has not expanded the rule beyond three  additional contiguous seats. Section 35.138(d)(1) of the final rule  requires public entities to make available for purchase three additional  tickets for seats in the same row that are contiguous with the  wheelchair space provided that at the time of the purchase there are  three such seats available. The requirement that the additional seats be  ``contiguous with the wheelchair space'' does not mean that each of the  additional seats must be in actual contact or have a border in common  with the wheelchair space; however, at least one of the additional seats  should be immediately adjacent to the wheelchair space. The Department  recognizes that it will often be necessary to use vacant wheelchair  spaces to provide for contiguous seating.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has added paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) to clarify  that in situations where there are insufficient unsold seats to provide  three additional contiguous seats per wheelchair space or a ticket  office restricts sales of tickets to a particular event to less than  four tickets per customer, the obligation to make available three  additional contiguous seats per wheelchair space would be affected. For  example, if at the time of purchase, there are only two additional  contiguous seats available for purchase because the third has been sold  already, then the ticket purchaser would be entitled to two such seats.  In this situation, the public entity would be required to make up the  difference by offering one additional ticket for sale that is as close  as possible to the accessible seats. Likewise, if ticket purchases for  an event are limited to two per customer, a person who uses a wheelchair  who seeks to purchase tickets would be entitled to purchase only one  additional contiguous seat for the event.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also has added paragraph (d)(4) to clarify that the  requirement for   three additional contiguous seats is not intended to serve as a cap if  the maximum number of tickets that may be purchased by members of the  general public exceeds the four tickets an individual with a disability  ordinarily would be allowed to purchase (i.e., a wheelchair space and  three additional contiguous seats). If the maximum number of tickets  that may be purchased by members of the general public exceeds four, an  individual with a disability is to be allowed to purchase the maximum  number of tickets; however, additional tickets purchased by an  individual with a disability beyond the wheelchair space and the three  additional contiguous seats provided in Sec.  35.138(d)(1) do not have  to be contiguous with the wheelchair space.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM proposed at Sec.  35.138(i)(2) that for group sales, if a  group includes one or more individuals who use a wheelchair, then the  group shall be placed in a seating area with accessible seating so that,  if possible, the group can sit together. If it is necessary to divide  the group, it should be divided so that the individuals in the group who  use wheelchairs are not isolated from the rest of the members of their  group. The final rule retains the NPRM language in paragraph (d)(5).</p><p class="depth0">Hold-and-release of unsold accessible seating. The Department  recognizes that not all accessible seating will be sold in all assembly  areas for every event to individuals with disabilities who need such  seating and that public entities may have opportunities to sell such  seating to the general public. The Department proposed in the NPRM a  provision aimed at striking a balance between affording individuals with  disabilities adequate time to purchase accessible seating and the  entity's desire to maximize ticket sales. In the NPRM, the Department  proposed Sec.  35.138(f), which allowed for the release of accessible  seating under the following circumstances: (i) When all seating in the  facility has been sold, excluding luxury boxes, club boxes, or suites;  (ii) when all seating in a designated area has been sold and the  accessible seating being released is in the same area; or (iii) when all  seating in a designated price range has been sold and the accessible  seating being released is within the same price range.</p><p class="depth0">The Department's NPRM asked ``whether additional regulatory guidance  is required or appropriate in terms of a more detailed or set schedule  for the release of tickets in conjunction with the three approaches  described above. For example, does the proposed regulation address the  variable needs of assembly areas covered by the ADA? Is additional  regulatory guidance required to eliminate discriminatory policies,  practices and procedures related to the sale, hold, and release of  accessible seating? What considerations should appropriately inform the  determination of when unsold accessible seating can be released to the  general public?'' 73 FR 34466, 34484 (June 17, 2008).</p><p class="depth0">The Department received comments both supporting and opposing the  inclusion of a hold-and-release provision. One side proposed loosening  the restrictions on the release of unsold accessible seating. One  commenter from a trade association suggested that tickets should be  released regardless of whether there is a sell-out, and that these  tickets should be released according to a set schedule. Conversely,  numerous individuals, advocacy groups, and at least one public entity  urged the Department to tighten the conditions under which unsold  tickets for accessible seating may be released. These commenters  suggested that venues should not be permitted to release tickets during  the first two weeks of sale, or alternatively, that they should not be  permitted to be released earlier than 48 hours before a sold-out event.  Many of these commenters criticized the release of accessible seating  under the second and third prongs of Sec.  35.138(f) in the NPRM (when  there is a sell-out in general seating in a designated seating area or  in a price range), arguing that it would create situations where general  seating would be available for purchase while accessible seating would  not be.</p><p class="depth0">Numerous commenters--both from the industry and from advocacy  groups--asked for clarification of the term ``sell-out.'' Business  groups commented that industry practice is to declare a sell-out when  there are only ``scattered singles'' available--isolated seats that  cannot be purchased as a set of adjacent pairs. Many of those same  commenters also requested that ``sell-out'' be qualified with the phrase  ``of all seating available for sale'' since it is industry practice to  hold back from release tickets to be used for groups connected with that  event (e.g., the promoter, home team, or sports league). They argued  that those tickets are not available for sale and any return of these  tickets to the general inventory happens close to the event date. Noting  the practice of holding back tickets, one advocacy group suggested that  covered entities be required to hold back accessible seating in  proportion to the number of tickets that are held back for later  release.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has concluded that it would be inappropriate to  interfere with industry practice by defining what constitutes a ``sell- out'' and that a public entity should continue to use its own approach  to defining a ``sell-out.'' If, however, a public entity declares a  sell-out by reference to those seats that are available for sale, but it  holds back tickets that it reasonably anticipates will be released  later, it must hold back a proportional percentage of accessible seating  to be released as well.</p><p class="depth0">Adopting any of the alternatives proposed in the comments summarized  above would have upset the balance between protecting the rights of  individuals with disabilities and meeting venues' concerns about lost  revenue from unsold accessible seating. As a result, the Department has  retained Sec.  35.138(f) (renumbered as Sec.  35.138(e)) in the final  rule.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has, however, modified the regulation text to specify  that accessible seating may be released only when ``all non-accessible  tickets in a designated seating area have been sold and the tickets for  accessible seating are being released in the same designated area.'' As  stated in the NPRM, the Department intended for this provision to allow,  for example, the release of accessible seating at the orchestra level  when all other seating at the orchestra level is sold. The Department  has added this language to the final rule at Sec.  35.138(e)(1)(ii) to  clarify that venues cannot designate or redesignate seating areas for  the purpose of maximizing the release of unsold accessible seating. So,  for example, a venue may not determine on an ad hoc basis that a group  of seats at the orchestra level is a designated seating area in order to  release unsold accessible seating in that area.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also has maintained the hold-and-release provisions  that appeared in the NPRM but has added a provision to address the  release of accessible seating for series-of-events tickets on a series- of-events basis. Many commenters asked the Department whether unsold  accessible seating may be converted to general seating and released to  the general public on a season-ticket basis or longer when tickets  typically are sold as a season-ticket package or other long-term basis.  Several disability rights organizations and individual commenters argued  that such a practice should not be permitted, and, if it were, that  conditions should be imposed to ensure that individuals with  disabilities have future access to those seats.</p><p class="depth0">The Department interprets the fundamental principle of the ADA as a  requirement to give individuals with disabilities equal, not better,  access to those opportunities available to the general public. Thus, for  example, a public entity that sells out its facility on a season-ticket  only basis is not required to leave unsold its accessible seating if no  persons with disabilities purchase those season-ticket seats. Of course,  public entities may choose to go beyond what is required by reserving  accessible seating for individuals with disabilities (or releasing such  seats for sale to the general public) on an individual-game basis.</p><p class="depth0">If a covered entity chooses to release unsold accessible seating for  sale on a season-ticket or other long-term basis, it must meet at least  two conditions. Under Sec.  35.138(g) of the final rule, public entities  must leave flexibility for game-day change-outs to accommodate ticket  transfers on the secondary market. And public entities must modify their  ticketing policies so that, in future years, individuals with  disabilities will have the ability to purchase accessible seating on the  same basis as other patrons (e.g., as season tickets). Put differently,  releasing accessible seating to the general public on a season-ticket or  other long-term basis cannot result in that seating being lost to  individuals with disabilities in perpetuity. If, in future years, season  tickets become available and persons with disabilities have reached the  top of the waiting list or have met any other eligibility criteria for  season-ticket purchases, public entities must ensure that accessible  seating will be made available to the eligible individuals. In order to  accomplish this, the Department has added Sec.  35.138(e)(3)(i) to  require public entities that release accessible season tickets to  individuals who do not have disabilities that require the features of  accessible seating to establish a process to prevent the automatic  reassignment of such ticket holders to accessible seating. For example,  a public entity could have in place a system whereby accessible seating  that was released because it was not purchased by individuals with  disabilities is not in the pool of tickets available for purchase for  the following season unless and until the conditions for ticket release  have been satisfied in the following season. Alternatively, a public  entity might release tickets for accessible seating only when a  purchaser who does not need its features agrees that he or she has no  guarantee of or right to the same seats in the following season, or that  if season tickets are guaranteed for the following season, the purchaser  agrees that the offer to purchase tickets is limited to non-accessible  seats having to the extent practicable, comparable price, view, and  amenities to the accessible seats such individuals held in the prior  year. The Department is aware that this rule may require some  administrative changes but believes that this process will not create  undue financial and administrative burdens. The Department believes that  this approach is balanced and beneficial. It will allow public entities  to sell all of their seats and will leave open the possibility, in  future seasons or series of events, that persons who need accessible  seating may have access to it.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also has added Sec.  35.138(e)(3)(ii) to address how  season tickets or series-of-events tickets that have attached ownership  rights should be handled if the ownership right returns to the public  entity (e.g., when holders forfeit their ownership right by failing to  purchase season tickets or sell their ownership right back to a public  entity). If the ownership right is for   accessible seating, the public entity is required to adopt a process  that allows an eligible individual with a disability who requires the  features of such seating to purchase the rights and tickets for such  seating.</p><p class="depth0">Nothing in the regulatory text prevents a public entity from  establishing a process whereby such ticket holders agree to be  voluntarily reassigned from accessible seating to another seating area  so that individuals with mobility disabilities or disabilities that  require the features of accessible seating and who become newly eligible  to purchase season tickets have an opportunity to do so. For example, a  public entity might seek volunteers to relocate to another location that  is at least as good in terms of its location, price, and amenities, or a  public entity might use a seat with forfeited ownership rights as an  inducement to get a ticket holder to give up accessible seating he or  she does not need.</p><p class="depth0">Ticket transfer. The Department received many comments asking  whether accessible seating has the same transfer rights as general  seats. The proposed regulation at Sec.  35.138(e) required that  individuals with disabilities must be allowed to purchase season tickets  for accessible seating on the same terms and conditions as individuals  purchasing season tickets for general seating, including the right--if  it exists for other ticket-holders--to transfer individual tickets to  friends or associates. Some commenters pointed out that the NPRM  proposed explicitly allowing individuals with disabilities holding  season tickets to transfer tickets but did not address the transfer of  tickets purchased for individual events. Several commenters representing  assembly areas argued that persons with disabilities holding tickets for  an individual event should not be allowed to sell or transfer them to  third parties because such ticket transfers would increase the risk of  fraud or would make unclear the obligation of the entity to accommodate  secondary ticket transfers. They argued that individuals holding  accessible seating should either be required to transfer their tickets  to another individual with a disability or return them to the facility  for a refund.</p><p class="depth0">Although the Department is sympathetic to concerns about  administrative burden, curtailing transfer rights for accessible seating  when other ticket holders are permitted to transfer tickets would be  inconsistent with the ADA's guiding principle that individuals with  disabilities must have rights equal to others. Thus, the Department has  added language in the final rule in Sec.  35.138(f) that requires that  individuals with disabilities holding accessible seating for any event  have the same transfer rights accorded other ticket holders for that  event. Section 35.138(f) also preserves the rights of individuals with  disabilities who hold tickets to accessible seats for a series of events  to transfer individual tickets to others, regardless of whether the  transferee needs accessible seating. This approach recognizes the common  practice of individuals splitting season tickets or other multi-event  ticket packages with friends, colleagues, or other spectators to make  the purchase of season tickets affordable; individuals with disabilities  should not be placed in the burdensome position of having to find  another individual with a disability with whom to share the package.</p><p class="depth0">This provision, however, does not require public entities to seat an  individual who holds a ticket to an accessible seat in such seating if  the individual does not need the accessible features of the seat. A  public entity may reserve the right to switch these individuals to  different seats if they are available, but a public entity is not  required to remove a person without a disability who is using accessible  seating from that seating, even if a person who uses a wheelchair shows  up with a ticket from the secondary market for a non-accessible seat and  wants accessible seating.</p><p class="depth0">Secondary ticket market. Section 35.138(g) is a new provision in the  final rule that requires a public entity to modify its policies,  practices, or procedures to ensure that an individual with a disability,  who acquires a ticket in the secondary ticket market, may use that  ticket under the same terms and conditions as other ticket holders who  acquire a ticket in the secondary market for an event or series of  events. This principle was discussed in the NPRM in connection with  Sec.  35.138(e), pertaining to season-ticket sales. There, the  Department asked for public comment regarding a public entity's proposed  obligation to accommodate the transfer of accessible seating tickets on  the secondary ticket market to those who do not need accessible seating  and vice versa.</p><p class="depth0">The secondary ticket market, for the purposes of this rule, broadly  means any transfer of tickets after the public entity's initial sale of  tickets to individuals or entities. It thus encompasses a wide variety  of transactions, from ticket transfers between friends to transfers  using commercial exchange systems. Many commenters noted that the  distinction between the primary and secondary ticket market has become  blurred as a result of agreements between teams, leagues, and secondary  market sellers. These commenters noted that the secondary market may  operate independently of the public entity, and parts of the secondary  market, such as ticket transfers between friends, undoubtedly are  outside the direct jurisdiction of the public entity.</p><p class="depth0">To the extent that venues seat persons who have purchased tickets on  the secondary market, they must similarly seat persons with disabilities  who have purchased tickets on the secondary market. In addition, some   public entities may acquire ADA obligations directly by formally  entering the secondary ticket market.</p><p class="depth0">The Department's enforcement experience with assembly areas also has  revealed that venues regularly provide for and make last-minute seat  transfers. As long as there are vacant wheelchair spaces, requiring  venues to provide wheelchair spaces for patrons who acquired  inaccessible seats and need wheelchair spaces is an example of a  reasonable modification of a policy under title II of the ADA.  Similarly, a person who has a ticket for a wheelchair space but who does  not require its accessible features could be offered non-accessible  seating if such seating is available.</p><p class="depth0">The Department's longstanding position that title II of the ADA  requires venues to make reasonable modifications in their policies to  allow individuals with disabilities who acquired non-accessible tickets  on the secondary ticket market to be seated in accessible seating, where  such seating is vacant, is supported by the only Federal court to  address this issue. See Independent Living Resources v. Oregon Arena  Corp., 1 F. Supp. 2d 1159, 1171 (D. Or. 1998). The Department has  incorporated this position into the final rule at Sec.  35.138(g)(2).</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM contained two questions aimed at gauging concern with the  Department's consideration of secondary ticket market sales. The first  question asked whether a secondary purchaser who does not have a  disability and who buys an accessible seat should be required to move if  the space is needed for someone with a disability.</p><p class="depth0">Many disability rights advocates answered that the individual should  move provided that there is a seat of comparable or better quality  available for him and his companion. Some venues, however, expressed  concerns about this provision, and asked how they are to identify who  should be moved and what obligations apply if there are no seats  available that are equivalent or better in quality.</p><p class="depth0">The Department's second question asked whether there are particular  concerns about the obligation to provide accessible seating, including a  wheelchair space, to an individual with a disability who purchases an  inaccessible seat through the secondary market.</p><p class="depth0">Industry commenters contended that this requirement would create a  ``logistical nightmare,'' with venues scrambling to reseat patrons in  the short time between the opening of the venues' doors and the  commencement of the event. Furthermore, they argued that they might not  be able to reseat all individuals and that even if they were able to do  so, patrons might be moved to inferior seats (whether in accessible or  non-accessible seating). These commenters also were concerned that they  would be sued by patrons moved under such circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">These commenters seem to have misconstrued the rule. Covered  entities are not required to seat every person who acquires a ticket for  inaccessible seating but needs accessible seating, and are not required  to move any individual who acquires a ticket for accessible seating but  does not need it. Covered entities that allow patrons to buy and sell  tickets on the secondary market must make reasonable modifications to  their policies to allow persons with disabilities to participate in  secondary ticket transfers. The Department believes that there is no  one-size-fits-all rule that will suit all assembly areas. In those  circumstances where a venue has accessible seating vacant at the time an  individual with a disability who needs accessible seating presents his  ticket for inaccessible seating at the box office, the venue must allow  the individual to exchange his ticket for an accessible seat in a  comparable location if such an accessible seat is vacant. Where,  however, a venue has sold all of its accessible seating, the venue has  no obligation to provide accessible seating to the person with a  disability who purchased an inaccessible seat on the secondary market.  Venues may encourage individuals with disabilities who hold tickets for  inaccessible seating to contact the box office before the event to  notify them of their need for accessible seating, even though they may  not require ticketholders to provide such notice.</p><p class="depth0">The Department notes that public entities are permitted, though not  required, to adopt policies regarding moving patrons who do not need the  features of an accessible seat. If a public entity chooses to do so, it  might mitigate administrative concerns by marking tickets for accessible  seating as such, and printing on the ticket that individuals who  purchase such seats but who do not need accessible seating are subject  to being moved to other seats in the facility if the accessible seating  is required for an individual with a disability. Such a venue might also  develop and publish a ticketing policy to provide transparency to the  general public and to put holders of tickets for accessible seating who  do not require it on notice that they may be moved.</p><p class="depth0">Prevention of fraud in purchase of accessible seating. Assembly area  managers and advocacy groups have informed the Department that the  fraudulent purchase of accessible seating is a pressing concern. Curbing  fraud is a goal that public entities and individuals with disabilities  share. Steps taken to prevent fraud, however, must be balanced carefully  against the privacy rights of individuals with disabilities. Such  measures also must not impose burdensome requirements upon, nor restrict  the rights of, individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department struck a balance between these competing  concerns by proposing Sec.  35.138(h), which prohibited   public entities from asking for proof of disability before the purchase  of accessible seating but provided guidance in two paragraphs on  appropriate measures for curbing fraud. Paragraph (1) proposed allowing  a public entity to ask individuals purchasing single-event tickets for  accessible seating whether they are wheelchair users. Paragraph (2)  proposed allowing a public entity to require the individuals purchasing  accessible seating for season tickets or other multi-event ticket  packages to attest in writing that the accessible seating is for a  wheelchair user. Additionally, the NPRM proposed to permit venues, when  they have good cause to believe that an individual has fraudulently  purchased accessible seating, to investigate that individual.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters objected to this rule on the ground that it would  require a wheelchair user to be the purchaser of tickets. The Department  has reworded this paragraph to reflect that the individual with a  disability does not have to be the ticket purchaser. The final rule  allows third parties to purchase accessible tickets at the request of an  individual with a disability.</p><p class="depth0">Commenters also argued that other individuals with disabilities who  do not use wheelchairs should be permitted to purchase accessible  seating. Some individuals with disabilities who do not use wheelchairs  urged the Department to change the rule, asserting that they, too, need  accessible seating. The Department agrees that such seating, although  designed for use by a wheelchair user, may be used by non-wheelchair  users, if those persons are persons with a disability who need to use  accessible seating because of a mobility disability or because their  disability requires the use of the features that accessible seating  provides (e.g., individuals who cannot bend their legs because of  braces, or individuals who, because of their disability, cannot sit in a  straight-back chair).</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters raised concerns that allowing venues to ask  questions to determine whether individuals purchasing accessible seating  are doing so legitimately would burden individuals with disabilities in  the purchase of accessible seating. The Department has retained the  substance of this provision in Sec.  35.138(h) of the final rule, but  emphasizes that such questions should be asked at the initial time of  purchase. For example, if the method of purchase is via the Internet,  then the question(s) should be answered by clicking a yes or no box  during the transaction. The public entity may warn purchasers that  accessible seating is for individuals with disabilities and that  individuals purchasing such tickets fraudulently are subject to  relocation.</p><p class="depth0">One commenter argued that face-to-face contact between the venue and  the ticket holder should be required in order to prevent fraud and  suggested that individuals who purchase accessible seating should be  required to pick up their tickets at the box office and then enter the  venue immediately. The Department has declined to adopt that suggestion.  It would be discriminatory to require individuals with disabilities to  pick up tickets at the box office when other spectators are not required  to do so. If the assembly area wishes to make face-to-face contact with  accessible seating ticket holders to curb fraud, it may do so through  its ushers and other customer service personnel located within the  seating area.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters asked whether it is permissible for assembly areas  to have voluntary clubs where individuals with disabilities self- identify to the public entity in order to become a member of a club that  entitles them to purchase accessible seating reserved for club members  or otherwise receive priority in purchasing accessible seating. The  Department agrees that such clubs are permissible, provided that a  reasonable amount of accessible seating remains available at all prices  and dispersed at all locations for individuals with disabilities who are  non-members.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.  35.139 Direct threat</p><p class="depth0">In Appendix A of the Department's 1991 title II regulation, the  Department included a detailed discussion of ``direct threat'' that,  among other things, explained that ``the principles established in Sec.   36.208 of the Department's [title III] regulation'' were ``applicable''  as well to title II, insofar as ``questions of safety are involved.'' 28  CFR part 35, app. A at 565 (2009). In the final rule, the Department has  included specific requirements related to ``direct threat'' that  parallel those in the title III rule. These requirements are found in  new Sec.  35.139.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart D--Program Accessibility</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.150(b)(2) Safe harbor</p><p class="depth0">The ``program accessibility'' requirement in regulations  implementing title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act requires  that each service, program, or activity, when viewed in its entirety, be  readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. 28  CFR 35.150(a). Because title II evaluates a public entity's programs,  services, and activities in their entirety, public entities have  flexibility in addressing accessibility issues. Program access does not  necessarily require a public entity to make each of its existing  facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,  and public entities are not required to make structural changes to  existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving  program   access. See id. \3\ Public entities do, however, have program access  considerations that are independent of, but may coexist with,  requirements imposed by new construction or alteration requirements in  those same facilities. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ The term ``existing facility'' is defined in Sec.  35.104 as  amended by this rule. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Where a public entity opts to alter existing facilities to comply  with its program access requirements, the entity must meet the  accessibility requirements for alterations set out in Sec.  35.151.  Under the final rule, these alterations will be subject to the 2010  Standards. The 2010 Standards introduce technical and scoping  specifications for many elements not covered by the 1991 Standards. In  existing facilities, these supplemental requirements need to be taken  into account by a public entity in ensuring program access. Also  included in the 2010 Standards are revised technical and scoping  requirements for a number of elements that were addressed in the 1991  Standards. These revised requirements reflect incremental changes that  were added either because of additional study by the Access Board or in  order to harmonize requirements with the model codes.</p><p class="depth0">Although the program accessibility standard offers public entities a  level of discretion in determining how to achieve program access, in the  NPRM, the Department proposed an addition to Sec.  35.150 at Sec.   35.150(b)(2), denominated ``Safe Harbor,'' to clarify that ``[i]f a  public entity has constructed or altered elements * * * in accordance  with the specifications in either the 1991 Standards or the Uniform  Federal Accessibility Standard, such public entity is not, solely  because of the Department's adoption of the [2010] Standards, required  to retrofit such elements to reflect incremental changes in the proposed  standards.'' 73 FR 34466, 34505 (June 17, 2008). In these circumstances,  the public entity would be entitled to a safe harbor for the already  compliant elements until those elements are altered. The safe harbor  does not negate a public entity's new construction or alteration  obligations. A public entity must comply with the new construction or  alteration requirements in effect at the time of the construction or  alteration. With respect to existing facilities designed and constructed  after January 26, 1992, but before the public entities are required to  comply with the 2010 Standards, the rule is that any elements in these  facilities that were not constructed in conformance with UFAS or the  1991 Standards are in violation of the ADA and must be brought into  compliance. If elements in existing facilities were altered after  January 26, 1992, and those alterations were not made in conformance  with the alteration requirements in effect at the time, then those  alteration violations must be corrected. Section 35.150(b)(2) of the  final rule specifies that until the compliance date for the Standards  (18 months from the date of publication of the rule), facilities or  elements covered by Sec.  35.151(a) or (b) that are noncompliant with  either the 1991 Standards or UFAS shall be made accessible in accordance  with the 1991 Standards, UFAS, or the 2010 Standards. Once the  compliance date is reached, such noncompliant facilities or elements  must be made accessible in accordance with the 2010 Standards.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received many comments on the safe harbor during the  60-day public comment period. Advocacy groups were opposed to the safe  harbor for compliant elements in existing facilities. These commenters  objected to the Department's characterization of revisions between the  1991 and 2010 Standards as incremental changes and assert that these  revisions represent important advances in accessibility for individuals  with disabilities. Commenters saw no basis for ``grandfathering''  outdated accessibility standards given the flexibility inherent in the  program access standard. Others noted that title II's ``undue financial  and administrative burdens'' and ``fundamental alteration'' defenses  eliminate any need for further exemptions from compliance. Some  commenters suggested that entities' past efforts to comply with the  program access standard of 28 CFR 35.150(a) might appropriately be a  factor in determining what is required in the future.</p><p class="depth0">Many public entities welcomed the Department's proposed safe harbor.  These commenters contend that the safe harbor allows public entities  needed time to evaluate program access in light of the 2010 Standards,  and incorporate structural changes in a careful and thoughtful way  toward increasing accessibility entity-wide. Many felt that it would be  an ineffective use of public funds to update buildings to retrofit  elements that had already been constructed or modified to Department- issued and sanctioned specifications. One entity pointed to the  ``possibly budget-breaking'' nature of forcing compliance with  incremental changes.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has reviewed and considered all information received  during the 60-day public comment period. Upon review, the Department has  decided to retain the title II safe harbor with minor revisions. The  Department believes that the safe harbor provides an important measure  of clarity and certainty for public entities as to the effect of the  final rule with respect to existing facilities. Additionally, by  providing a safe harbor for elements already in compliance with the  technical and scoping specifications in the 1991 Standards or UFAS,  funding that would otherwise be spent on incremental changes and  repeated retrofitting is freed up to be used toward increased entity- wide program access. Public entities may thereby   make more efficient use of the resources available to them to ensure  equal access to their services, programs, or activities for all  individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">The safe harbor adopted with this final rule is a narrow one, as the  Department recognizes that this approach may delay, in some cases, the  increased accessibility that the revised requirements would provide, and  that for some individuals with disabilities the impact may be  significant. This safe harbor operates only with respect to elements  that are in compliance with the scoping and technical specifications in  either the 1991 Standards or UFAS; it does not apply to supplemental  requirements, those elements for which scoping and technical  specifications are first provided in the 2010 Standards.</p><p class="depth0">Existing Facilities</p><p class="depth0">Existing play areas. The 1991 Standards do not include specific  requirements for the design and construction of play areas. To meet  program accessibility requirements where structural changes are  necessary, public entities have been required to apply the general new  construction and alteration standards to the greatest extent possible,  including with respect to accessible parking, routes to the playground,  playground equipment, and playground amenities (e.g., picnic tables and  restrooms). The Access Board published final guidelines for play areas  in October 2000. The guidelines extended beyond general playground  access to establish specific scoping and technical requirements for  ground-level and elevated play components, accessible routes connecting  the components, accessible ground surfaces, and maintenance of those  surfaces. These guidelines filled a void left by the 1991 Standards.  They have been referenced in Federal playground construction and safety  guidelines and have been used voluntarily when many play areas across  the country have been altered or constructed.</p><p class="depth0">In adopting the 2004 ADAAG (which includes the 2000 play area  guidelines), the Department acknowledges both the importance of  integrated, full access to play areas for children and parents with  disabilities, as well as the need to avoid placing an untenable fiscal  burden on public entities. In the NPRM, the Department stated it was  proposing two specific provisions to reduce the impact on existing  facilities that undertake structural modifications pursuant to the  program accessibility requirement. First, the Department proposed in  Sec.  35.150(b)(4) that existing play areas that are not being altered  would be permitted to meet a reduced scoping requirement with respect to  their elevated play components. Elevated play components, which are  found on most playgrounds, are the individual components that are linked  together to form large-scale composite playground equipment (e.g., the  monkey bars attached to the suspension bridge attached to the tube  slide, etc.) The 2010 Standards provide that a play area that includes  both ground level and elevated play components must ensure that a  specified number of the ground-level play components and at least 50  percent of the elevated play components are accessible.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department asked for specific public comment with  regard to whether existing play areas should be permitted to substitute  additional ground-level play components for the elevated play components  they would otherwise have been required to make accessible. The  Department also queried if there were other requirements applicable to  play areas in the 2004 ADAAG for which the Department should consider  exemptions or reduced scoping. Many commenters opposed permitting  existing play areas to make such substitutions. Several commenters  stated that the Access Board already completed significant negotiation  and cost balancing in its rulemaking, so no additional exemptions should  be added in either meeting program access requirements or in  alterations. Others noted that elevated components are generally viewed  as the more challenging and exciting by children, so making more ground  than elevated play components accessible would result in discrimination  against children with disabilities in general and older children with  disabilities in particular. They argued that the ground components would  be seen as equipment for younger children and children with  disabilities, while elevated components would serve only older children  without disabilities. In addition, commenters advised that including  additional ground-level play components would require more accessible  route and use zone surfacing, which would result in a higher cost burden  than making elevated components accessible.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also asked for public comment on whether it would be  appropriate for the Access Board to consider issuing guidelines for  alterations to play and recreational facilities that would permit  reduced scoping of accessible components or substitution of ground-level  play components in lieu of elevated play components. Most commenters  opposed any additional reductions in scoping and substitutions. These  commenters uniformly stated that the Access Board completed sufficient  negotiation during its rulemaking on its play area guidelines published  in 2000 and that those guidelines consequently should stand as is. One  commenter advocated reduced scoping and substitution of ground play  components during alterations only for those play areas built prior to  the finalization of the guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has considered the comments it has received and has  determined that it is not necessary to provide a specific   exemption to the scoping for components for existing play areas or to  recommend reduced scoping or additional exemptions for alteration, and  has deleted the reduced scoping proposed in NPRM Sec.  35.150(b)(4)(i)  from the final rule. The Department believes that it is preferable for  public entities to try to achieve compliance with the design standards  established in the 2010 Standards. If this is not possible to achieve in  an existing setting, the requirements for program accessibility provide  enough flexibility to permit the covered entity to pursue alternative  approaches to provide accessibility.</p><p class="depth0">Second, in Sec.  35.150(b)(5)(i) of the NPRM, the Department  proposed language stating that existing play areas that are less than  1,000 square feet in size and are not otherwise being altered, need not  comply with the scoping and technical requirements for play areas in  section 240 of the 2004 ADAAG. The Department stated it selected this  size based on the provision in section 1008.2.4.1 of the 2004 ADAAG,  Exception 1, which permits play areas less than 1,000 square feet in  size to provide accessible routes with a reduced clear width (44 inches  instead of 60 inches). In its 2000 regulatory assessment for the play  area guidelines, the Access Board assumed that such ``small'' play areas  represented only about 20 percent of the play areas located in public  schools, and none of the play areas located in city and State parks  (which the Board assumed were typically larger than 1,000 square feet).</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department asked if existing play areas less than  1,000 square feet should be exempt from the requirements applicable to  play areas. The vast majority of commenters objected to such an  exemption. One commenter stated that many localities that have parks  this size are already making them accessible; many cited concerns that  this would leave all or most public playgrounds in small towns  inaccessible; and two commenters stated that, since many of New York  City's parks are smaller than 1,000 square feet, only scattered larger  parks in the various boroughs would be obliged to become accessible.  Residents with disabilities would then have to travel substantial  distances outside their own neighborhoods to find accessible  playgrounds. Some commenters responded that this exemption should not  apply in instances where the play area is the only one in the program,  while others said that if a play area is exempt for reasons of size, but  is the only one in the area, then it should have at least an accessible  route and 50 percent of its ground-level play components accessible. One  commenter supported the exemption as presented in the question.</p><p class="depth0">The Department is persuaded by these comments that it is  inappropriate to exempt public play areas that are less than 1,000  square feet in size. The Department believes that the factors used to  determine program accessibility, including the limits established by the  undue financial and administrative burdens defense, provide sufficient  flexibility to public entities in determining how to make their existing  play areas accessible. In those cases where a title II entity believes  that present economic concerns make it an undue financial and  administrative burden to immediately make its existing playgrounds  accessible in order to comply with program accessibility requirements,  then it may be reasonable for the entity to develop a multi-year plan to  bring its facilities into compliance.</p><p class="depth0">In addition to requesting public comment about the specific sections  in the NPRM, the Department also asked for public comment about the  appropriateness of a general safe harbor for existing play areas and a  safe harbor for public entities that have complied with State or local  standards specific to play areas. In the almost 200 comments received on  title II play areas, the vast majority of commenters strongly opposed  all safe harbors, exemptions, and reductions in scoping. By contrast,  one commenter advocated a safe harbor from compliance with the 2004  ADAAG play area requirements along with reduced scoping and exemptions  for both program accessibility and alterations; a second commenter  advocated only the general safe harbor from compliance with the  supplemental requirements.</p><p class="depth0">In response to the question of whether the Department should exempt  public entities from specific compliance with the supplemental  requirements for play areas, commenters stated that since no specific  standards previously existed, play areas are more than a decade behind  in providing full access for individuals with disabilities. When  accessible play areas were created, public entities, acting in good  faith, built them according to the 2004 ADAAG requirements; many  equipment manufacturers also developed equipment to meet those  guidelines. If existing playgrounds were exempted from compliance with  the supplemental guidelines, commenters said, those entities would be  held to a lesser standard and left with confusion, a sense of wasted  resources, and federally condoned discrimination and segregation.  Commenters also cited Federal agency settlement agreements on play areas  that required compliance with the guidelines. Finally, several  commenters observed that the provision of a safe harbor in this instance  was invalid for two reasons: (1) The rationale for other safe harbors-- that entities took action to comply with the 1991 Standards and should  not be further required to comply with new standards--does not exist;  and (2) concerns about financial and administrative burdens are  adequately addressed by program access requirements.</p><p class="depth0">The question of whether accessibility of play areas should continue  to be assessed on the basis of case-by-case evaluations elicited  conflicting responses. One commenter asserted that there is no evidence  that the case-by-case approach is not working and so it should continue  until found to be inconsistent with the ADA's goals. Another commenter  argued that case-by-case evaluations result in unpredictable outcomes  which result in costly and long court actions. A third commenter,  advocating against case-by-case evaluations, requested instead increased  direction and scoping to define what constitutes an accessible play area  program.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has considered all of the comments it received in  response to its questions and has concluded that there is insufficient  basis to establish a safe harbor from compliance with the supplemental  guidelines. Thus, the Department has eliminated the proposed exemption  contained in Sec.  35.150(b)(5)(i) of the NPRM for existing play areas  that are less than 1,000 square feet. The Department believes that the  factors used to determine program accessibility, including the limits  established by the undue financial and administrative burdens defense,  provide sufficient flexibility to public entities in determining how to  make their existing play areas accessible.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department also asked whether there are State and  local standards addressing play and recreation area accessibility and,  to the extent that there are such standards, whether facilities  currently governed by, and in compliance with, such State and local  standards or codes should be subject to a safe harbor from compliance  with applicable requirements in the 2004 ADAAG. The Department also  asked whether it would be appropriate for the Access Board to consider  the implementation of guidelines that would permit such a safe harbor  with respect to play and recreation areas undertaking alterations. In  response, commenters stated that few State or local governments have  standards that address issues of accessibility in play areas, and one  commenter organization said that it was unaware of any State or local  standards written specifically for accessible play areas. One commenter  observed from experience that most State and local governments were  waiting for the Access Board guidelines to become enforceable standards  as they had no standards themselves to follow. Another commenter offered  that public entities across the United States already include in their  playground construction bid specifications language that requires  compliance with the Access Board's guidelines. A number of commenters  advocated for the Access Board's guidelines to become comprehensive  Federal standards that would complement any abbreviated State and local  standards. One commenter, however, supported a safe harbor for play  areas undergoing alterations if the areas currently comply with State or  local standards.</p><p class="depth0">The Department is persuaded by these comments that there is  insufficient basis to establish a safe harbor for program access or  alterations for play areas built in compliance with State or local laws.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department asked whether ``a reasonable number, but  at least one'' is a workable standard to determine the appropriate  number of existing play areas that a public entity must make accessible.  Many commenters objected to this standard, expressing concern that the  phrase ``at least one'' would be interpreted as a maximum rather than a  minimum requirement. Such commenters feared that this language would  allow local governments to claim compliance by making just one public  park accessible, regardless of the locality's size, budget, or other  factors, and would support segregation, forcing children with  disabilities to leave their neighborhoods to enjoy an accessible play  area. While some commenters criticized what they viewed as a new  analysis of program accessibility, others asserted that the requirements  of program accessibility should be changed to address issues related to  play areas that are not the main program in a facility but are essential  components of a larger program (e.g., drop-in child care for a  courthouse).</p><p class="depth0">The Department believes that those commenters who opposed the  Department's ``reasonable number, but at least one'' standard for  program accessibility misunderstood the Department's proposal. The  Department did not intend any change in its longstanding interpretation  of the program accessibility requirement. Program accessibility requires  that each service, program, or activity be operated ``so that the  service, program, or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily  accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,'' 28 CFR  35.150(a), subject to the undue financial and administrative burdens and  fundamental alterations defenses provided in 28 CFR 35.150. In  determining how many facilities of a multi-site program must be made  accessible in order to make the overall program accessible, the standard  has always been an assessment of what is reasonable under the  circumstances to make the program readily accessible to and usable by  individuals with disabilities, taking into account such factors as the  size of the public entity, the particular program features offered at  each site, the geographical distance between sites, the travel times to  the sites, the number of sites, and availability of public  transportation to the sites. In choosing among available methods for  meeting this requirement, public entities are required to give priority  ``to those methods that offer services, programs, and activities * * *  in the most integrated setting appropriate.'' 28 CFR 35.150(b)(1). As a   result, in cases where the sites are widely dispersed with difficult  travel access and where the program features offered vary widely between  sites, program accessibility will require a larger number of facilities  to be accessible in order to ensure program accessibility than where  multiple sites are located in a concentrated area with easy travel  access and uniformity in program offerings.</p><p class="depth0">Commenters responded positively to the Department's question in the  NPRM whether the final rule should provide a list of factors that a  public entity should use to determine how many of its existing play  areas should be made accessible. Commenters also asserted strongly that  the number of existing parks in the locality should not be the main  factor. In addition to the Department's initial list--including number  of play areas in an area, travel times or geographic distances between  play areas, and the size of the public entity--commenters recommended  such factors as availability of accessible pedestrian routes to the  playgrounds, ready availability of accessible transportation, comparable  amenities and services in and surrounding the play areas, size of the  playgrounds, and sufficient variety in accessible play components within  the playgrounds. The Department agrees that these factors should be  considered, where appropriate, in any determination of whether program  accessibility has been achieved. However, the Department has decided  that it need not address these factors in the final rule itself because  the range of factors that might need to be considered would vary  depending upon the circumstances of particular public entities. The  Department does not believe any list would be sufficiently comprehensive  to cover every situation.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also requested public comment about whether there was  a ``tipping point'' at which the costs of compliance with the new  requirements for existing play areas would be so burdensome that the  entity would simply shut down the playground. Commenters generally  questioned the feasibility of determining a ``tipping point.'' No  commenters offered a recommended ``tipping point.'' Moreover, most  commenters stated that a ``tipping point'' is not a valid consideration  for various reasons, including that ``tipping points'' will vary based  upon each entity's budget and other mandates, and costs that are too  high will be addressed by the limitations of the undue financial and  administrative burdens defense in the program accessibility requirement  and that a ``tipping point'' must be weighed against quality of life  issues, which are difficult to quantify. The Department has decided that  comments did not establish any clear ``tipping point'' and therefore  provides no regulatory requirement in this area.</p><p class="depth0">Swimming pools. The 1991 Standards do not contain specific scoping  or technical requirements for swimming pools. As a result, under the  1991 title II regulation, title II entities that operate programs or  activities that include swimming pools have not been required to provide  an accessible route into those pools via a ramp or pool lift, although  they are required to provide an accessible route to such pools. In  addition, these entities continue to be subject to the general title II  obligation to make their programs usable and accessible to persons with  disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">The 2004 ADAAG includes specific technical and scoping requirements  for new and altered swimming pools at sections 242 and 1009. In the  NPRM, the Department sought to address the impact of these requirements  on existing swimming pools. Section 242.2 of the 2004 ADAAG states that  swimming pools must provide two accessible means of entry, except that  swimming pools with less than 300 linear feet of swimming pool wall are  only required to provide one accessible means of entry, provided that  the accessible means of entry is either a swimming pool lift complying  with section 1009.2 or a sloped entry complying with section 1009.3.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed, in Sec.  35.150(b)(4)(ii),  that for measures taken to comply with title II's program accessibility  requirements, existing swimming pools with at least 300 linear feet of  swimming pool wall would be required to provide only one accessible  means of access that complied with section 1009.2 or section 1009.3 of  the 2004 ADAAG.</p><p class="depth0">The Department specifically sought comment from public entities and  individuals with disabilities on the question whether the Department  should ``allow existing public entities to provide only one accessible  means of access to swimming pools more than 300 linear feet long?'' The  Department received significant public comment on this proposal.</p><p class="depth0">Most commenters opposed any reduction in the scoping required in the  2004 ADAAG, citing the fact that swimming is a common therapeutic form  of exercise for many individuals with disabilities. Many commenters also  stated that the cost of a swimming pool lift, approximately $5,000, or  other nonstructural options for pool access such as transfer steps,  transfer walls, and transfer platforms, would not be an undue financial  and administrative burden for most title II entities. Other commenters  pointed out that the undue financial and administrative burdens defense  already provided public entities with a means to reduce their scoping  requirements. A few commenters cited safety concerns resulting from  having just one accessible means of access, and stated that because  pools typically have one ladder for every 75 linear feet of pool wall,  they should   have more than one accessible means of access. One commenter stated that  construction costs for a public pool are approximately $4,000-4,500 per  linear foot, making the cost of a pool with 300 linear feet of swimming  pool wall approximately $1.2 million, compared to $5,000 for a pool  lift. Some commenters did not oppose the one accessible means of access  for larger pools so long as a lift was used. A few commenters approved  of the one accessible means of access for larger pools. The Department  also considered the American National Standard for Public Swimming  Pools, ANSI/NSPI-1 2003, section 23 of which states that all pools  should have at least two means of egress.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department also proposed at Sec.  35.150(b)(5)(ii)  that existing swimming pools with less than 300 linear feet of swimming  pool wall be exempted from having to comply with the provisions of  section 242.2. The Department's NPRM requested public comment about the  potential effect of this approach, asking whether existing swimming  pools with less than 300 linear feet of pool wall should be exempt from  the requirements applicable to swimming pools.</p><p class="depth0">Most commenters were opposed to this proposal. A number of  commenters stated, based on the Access Board estimates that 90 percent  of public high school pools, 40 percent of public park and community  center pools, and 30 percent of public college and university pools have  less than 300 linear feet of pool wall, that a large number of public  swimming pools would fall under this exemption. Other commenters pointed  to the existing undue financial and administrative burdens defenses as  providing public entities with sufficient protection from excessive  compliance costs. Few commenters supported this exemption.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also considered the fact that many existing swimming  pools owned or operated by public entities are recipients of Federal  financial assistance and therefore, are also subject to the program  accessibility requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has carefully considered all the information  available to it including the comments submitted on these two proposed  exemptions for swimming pools owned or operated by title II entities.  The Department acknowledges that swimming provides important  therapeutic, exercise, and social benefits for many individuals with  disabilities and is persuaded that exemption of many publicly owned or  operated pools from the 2010 Standards is neither appropriate nor  necessary. The Department agrees with the commenters that title II  already contains sufficient limitations on public entities' obligations  to make their programs accessible. In particular, the Department agrees  that those public entities that can demonstrate that making particular  existing swimming pools accessible in accordance with the 2010 Standards  would be an undue financial and administrative burden are sufficiently  protected from excessive compliance costs. Thus, the Department has  eliminated proposed Sec. Sec.  35.150(b)(4)(ii) and (b)(5)(ii) from the  final rule.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, although the NPRM contained no specific proposed  regulatory language on this issue, the NPRM sought comment on what would  be a workable standard for determining the appropriate number of  existing swimming pools that a public entity must make accessible for  its program to be accessible. The Department asked whether a  ``reasonable number, but at least one'' would be a workable standard  and, if not, whether there was a more appropriate specific standard. The  Department also asked if, in the alternative, the Department should  provide ``a list of factors that a public entity could use to determine  how many of its existing swimming pools to make accessible, e.g., number  of swimming pools, travel times or geographic distances between swimming  pools, and the size of the public entity?''</p><p class="depth0">A number of commenters expressed concern over the ``reasonable  number, but at least one'' standard and contended that, in reality,  public entities would never provide more than one accessible existing  pool, thus segregating individuals with disabilities. Other commenters  felt that the existing program accessibility standard was sufficient.  Still others suggested that one in every three existing pools should be  made accessible. One commenter suggested that all public pools should be  accessible. Some commenters proposed a list of factors to determine how  many existing pools should be accessible. Those factors include the  total number of pools, the location, size, and type of pools provided,  transportation availability, and lessons and activities available. A  number of commenters suggested that the standard should be based on  geographic areas, since pools serve specific neighborhoods. One  commenter argued that each pool should be examined individually to  determine what can be done to improve its accessibility.</p><p class="depth0">The Department did not include any language in the final rule that  specifies the ``reasonable number, but at least one'' standard for  program access. However, the Department believes that its proposal was  misunderstood by many commenters. Each service, program, or activity  conducted by a public entity, when viewed in its entirety, must still be  readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities unless  doing so would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the  program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens.  Determining which pool(s) to make accessible and whether more than one  accessible pool is necessary to provide program access   requires analysis of a number of factors, including, but not limited to,  the size of the public entity, geographical distance between pool sites,  whether more than one community is served by particular pools, travel  times to the pools, the total number of pools, the availability of  lessons and other programs and amenities at each pool, and the  availability of public transportation to the pools. In many instances,  making one existing swimming pool accessible will not be sufficient to  ensure program accessibility. There may, however, be some circumstances  where a small public entity can demonstrate that modifying one pool is  sufficient to provide access to the public entity's program of providing  public swimming pools. In all cases, a public entity must still  demonstrate that its programs, including the program of providing public  swimming pools, when viewed in their entirety, are accessible.</p><p class="depth0">Wading pools. The 1991 Standards do not address wading pools.  Section 242.3 of the 2004 ADAAG requires newly constructed or altered  wading pools to provide at least one sloped means of entry to the  deepest part of the pool. The Department was concerned about the  potential impact of this new requirement on existing wading pools.  Therefore, in the NPRM, the Department sought comments on whether  existing wading pools that are not being altered should be exempt from  this requirement, asking, ``[w]hat site constraints exist in existing  facilities that could make it difficult or infeasible to install a  sloped entry in an existing wading pool? Should existing wading pools  that are not being altered be exempt from the requirement to provide a  sloped entry?'' 73 FR 34466, 34487-88 (June 17, 2008). Most commenters  agreed that existing wading pools that are not being altered should be  exempt from this requirement. Almost all commenters felt that during  alterations a sloped entry should be provided unless it was technically  infeasible to do so. Several commenters felt that the required clear  deck space surrounding a pool provided sufficient space for a sloped  entry during alterations.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also solicited comments on the possibility of  exempting existing wading pools from the obligation to provide program  accessibility. Most commenters argued that installing a sloped entry in  an existing wading pool is not very feasible. Because covered entities  are not required to undertake modifications that would be technically  infeasible, the Department believes that the rule as drafted provides  sufficient protection from unwarranted expense to the operators of small  existing wading pools. Other existing wading pools, particularly those  larger pools associated with facilities such as aquatic centers or water  parks, must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, the  Department has not included such an exemption for wading pools in its  final rule.</p><p class="depth0">Saunas and steam rooms. The 1991 Standards do not address saunas and  steam rooms. Section 35.150(b)(5)(iii) of the NPRM exempted existing  saunas and steam rooms that seat only two individuals and were not being  altered from section 241 of the 2004 ADAAG, which requires an accessible  turning space. Two commenters objected to this exemption as unnecessary,  and argued that the cost of accessible saunas is not high and public  entities still have an undue financial and administrative burdens  defense.</p><p class="depth0">The Department considered these comments and has decided to  eliminate the exemption for existing saunas and steam rooms that seat  only two people. Such an exemption is unnecessary because covered  entities will not be subject to program accessibility requirements to  make existing saunas and steam rooms accessible if doing so constitutes  an undue financial and administrative burden. The Department believes it  is likely that because of their pre-fabricated forms, which include  built-in seats, it would be either technically infeasible or an undue  financial and administrative burden to modify such saunas and steams  rooms. Consequently, a separate exemption for saunas and steam rooms  would have been superfluous. Finally, employing the program  accessibility standard for small saunas and steam rooms is consistent  with the Department's decisions regarding the proposed exemptions for  play areas and swimming pools.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters also argued in favor of a specific exemption for  existing spas. The Department notes that the technical infeasibility and  program accessibility defenses are applicable equally to existing spas  and declines to adopt such an exemption.</p><p class="depth0">Other recreational facilities. In the NPRM, the Department asked  about a number of issues relating to recreation facilities such as team  or player seating areas, areas of sport activity, exercise machines,  boating facilities, fishing piers and platforms, and miniature golf  courses. The Department's questions addressed the costs and benefits of  applying the 2004 ADAAG to these spaces and facilities and the  application of the specific technical requirements in the 2004 ADAAG for  these spaces and facilities. The discussion of the comments received by  the Department on these issues and the Department's response to those  comments can be found in either the section of Appendix A to this rule  entitled ``Other Issues,'' or in Appendix B to the final title III rule,  which will be published today elsewhere in this volume.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151 New construction and alterations</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(a), which provided that those facilities that are  constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public  entity shall be designed, constructed, or altered to be readily  accessible to and usable   by individuals with disabilities, is unchanged in the final rule, but  has been redesignated as Sec.  35.151(a)(1). The Department has added a  new section, designated as Sec.  35.151(a)(2), to provide that full  compliance with the requirements of this section is not required where  an entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet  the requirements. Full compliance will be considered structurally  impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique  characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility  features. This exception was contained in the title III regulation and  in the 1991 Standards (applicable to both public accommodations and  facilities used by public entities), so it has applied to any covered  facility that was constructed under the 1991 Standards since the  effective date of the ADA. The Department added it to the text of Sec.   35.151 to maintain consistency between the design requirements that  apply under title II and those that apply under title III. The  Department received no significant comments about this section.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(b) Alterations</p><p class="depth0">The 1991 title II regulation does not contain any specific  regulatory language comparable to the 1991 title III regulation relating  to alterations and path of travel for covered entities, although the  1991 Standards describe standards for path of travel during alterations  to a primary function. See 28 CFR part 36, app A., section 4.1.6(a)  (2009).</p><p class="depth0">The path of travel requirements contained in the title III  regulation are based on section 303(a)(2) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C.  12183(a)(2), which provides that when an entity undertakes an alteration  to a place of public accommodation or commercial facility that affects  or could affect the usability of or access to an area that contains a  primary function, the entity shall ensure that, to the maximum extent  feasible, the path of travel to the altered area--and the restrooms,  telephones, and drinking fountains serving it--is readily accessible to  and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who  use wheelchairs.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM proposed amending Sec.  35.151 to add both the path of  travel requirements and the exemption relating to barrier removal (as  modified to apply to the program accessibility standard in title II)  that are contained in the title III regulation to the title II  regulation. Proposed Sec.  35.151(b)(4) contained the requirements for  path of travel. Proposed Sec.  35.151(b)(2) stated that the path of  travel requirements of Sec.  35.151(b)(4) shall not apply to measures  taken solely to comply with program accessibility requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Where the specific requirements for path of travel apply under title  III, they are limited to the extent that the cost and scope of  alterations to the path of travel are disproportionate to the cost of  the overall alteration, as determined under criteria established by the  Attorney General.</p><p class="depth0">The Access Board included the path of travel requirement for  alterations to facilities covered by the standards (other than those  subject to the residential facilities standards) in section 202.4 of  2004 ADAAG. Section 35.151(b)(4)(iii) of the final rule establishes the  criteria for determining when the cost of alterations to the path of  travel is ``disproportionate'' to the cost of the overall alteration.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM also provided that areas such as supply storage rooms,  employee lounges and locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances, and  corridors are not areas containing a primary function. Nor are restroom  areas considered to contain a primary function unless the provision of  restrooms is a primary purpose of the facility, such as at a highway  rest stop. In that situation, a restroom would be considered to be an  ``area containing a primary function'' of the facility.</p><p class="depth0">The Department is not changing the requirements for program  accessibility. As provided in Sec.  35.151(b)(2) of the regulation, the  path of travel requirements of Sec.  35.151(b)(4) only apply to  alterations undertaken solely for purposes other than to meet the  program accessibility requirements. The exemption for the specific path  of travel requirement was included in the regulation to ensure that the  specific requirements and disproportionality exceptions for path of  travel are not applied when areas are being altered to meet the title II  program accessibility requirements in Sec.  35.150. In contrast, when  areas are being altered to meet program accessibility requirements, they  must comply with all of the applicable requirements referenced in  section 202 of the 2010 Standards. A covered title II entity must  provide accessibility to meet the requirements of Sec.  35.150 unless  doing so is an undue financial and administrative burden in accordance  with Sec.  35.150(a)(3). A covered title II entity may not use the  disproportionality exception contained in the path of travel provisions  as a defense to providing an accessible route as part of its obligation  to provide program accessibility. The undue financial and administrative  burden standard does not contain any bright line financial tests.</p><p class="depth0">The Department's proposed Sec.  35.151(b)(4) adopted the language  now contained in Sec.  36.403 of the title III regulation, including the  disproportionality limitation (i.e., alterations made to provide an  accessible path of travel to the altered area would be deemed  disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20  percent of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area).  Proposed Sec.  35.151(b)(2) provided that the path of travel  requirements do not apply to alterations undertaken solely to comply  with program accessibility requirements.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received a substantial number of comments objecting  to the Department's adoption of the exemption for the path of travel  requirements when alterations are undertaken solely to meet program  accessibility requirements. These commenters argued that the Department  had no statutory basis for providing this exemption nor does it serve  any purpose. In addition, these commenters argued that the path of  travel exemption has the effect of placing new limitations on the  obligations to provide program access. A number of commenters argued  that doing away with the path of travel requirement would render  meaningless the concept of program access. They argued that just as the  requirement to provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area  (regardless of the reason for the alteration), including making the  restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains that serve the altered  area accessible, is a necessary requirement in other alterations, it is  equally necessary for alterations made to provide program access.  Several commenters expressed concern that a readily accessible path of  travel be available to ensure that persons with disabilities can get to  the physical location in which programs are held. Otherwise, they will  not be able to access the public entity's service, program, or activity.  Such access is a cornerstone of the protections provided by the ADA.  Another commenter argued that it would be a waste of money to create an  accessible facility without having a way to get to the primary area.  This commenter also stated that the International Building Code (IBC)  requires the path of travel to a primary function area, up to 20 percent  of the cost of the project. Another commenter opposed the exemption,  stating that the trigger of an alteration is frequently the only time  that a facility must update its facilities to comply with evolving  accessibility standards.</p><p class="depth0">In the Department's view, the commenters objecting to the path of  travel exemption contained in Sec.  35.151(b)(2) did not understand the  intention behind the exemption. The exemption was not intended to  eliminate any existing requirements related to accessibility for  alterations undertaken in order to meet program access obligations under  Sec.  35.149 and Sec.  35.150. Rather, it was intended to ensure that  covered entities did not apply the path of travel requirements in lieu  of the overarching requirements in this Subpart that apply when making a  facility accessible in order to comply with program accessibility. The  exemption was also intended to make it clear that the disproportionality  test contained in the path of travel standards is not applicable in  determining whether providing program access results in an undue  financial and administration burden within the meaning of Sec.   35.150(a)(3). The exemption was also provided to maintain consistency  with the title III path of travel exemption for barrier removal, see  Sec.  36.304(d), in keeping with the Department's regulatory authority  under title II of the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. 12134(b); see also H. R Rep.  No. 101B485, pt. 2, at 84 (1990) (``The committee intends, however, that  the forms of discrimination prohibited by section 202 be identical to  those set out in the applicable provisions of titles I and III of this  legislation.'').</p><p class="depth0">For title II entities, the path of travel requirements are of  significance in those cases where an alteration is being made solely for  reasons other than program accessibility. For example, a public entity  might have six courtrooms in two existing buildings and might determine  that only three of those courtrooms and the public use and common use  areas serving those courtrooms in one building are needed to be made  accessible in order to satisfy its program access obligations. When the  public entity makes those courtrooms and the public use and common use  areas serving them accessible in order to meet its program access  obligations, it will have to comply with the 2010 Standards unless the  public entity can demonstrate that full compliance would result in undue  financial and administrative burdens as described in Sec.  35.150(a)(3).  If such action would result in an undue financial or administrative  burden, the public entity would nevertheless be required to take some  other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens  but would ensure that the benefits and services provided by the public  entity are readily accessible to persons with disabilities. When the  public entity is making modifications to meet its program access  obligation, it may not rely on the path of travel exception under Sec.   35.151(b)(4), which limits the requirement to those alterations where  the cost and scope of the alterations are not disproportionate to the  cost and scope of the overall alterations. If the public entity later  decides to alter courtrooms in the other building, for purposes of  updating the facility (and, as previously stated, has met its program  access obligations) then in that case, the public entity would have to  comply with the path of travel requirements in the 2010 Standards  subject to the disproportionality exception set forth in Sec.   35.151(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0">The Department has slightly revised proposed Sec.  35.151(b)(2) to  make it clearer that the path of travel requirements only apply when  alterations are undertaken solely for purposes other than program  accessibility.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(b)(4)(ii)(C) Path of travel--safe harbor</p><p class="depth0">In Sec.  35.151(b)(4)(ii)(C) of the NPRM, the Department included a  provision that stated   that public entities that have brought required elements of path of  travel into compliance with the 1991 Standards are not required to  retrofit those elements in order to reflect incremental changes in the  2010 Standards solely because of an alteration to a primary function  area that is served by that path of travel. In these circumstances, the  public entity is entitled to a safe harbor and is only required to  modify elements to comply with the 2010 Standards if the public entity  is planning an alteration to the element.</p><p class="depth0">A substantial number of commenters objected to the Department's  imposition of a safe harbor for alterations to facilities of public  entities that comply with the 1991 Standards. These commenters argued  that if a public entity is already in the process of altering its  facility, there should be a legal requirement that individuals with  disabilities be entitled to increased accessibility by using the 2010  Standards for path of travel work. They also stated that they did not  believe there was a statutory basis for ``grandfathering'' facilities  that comply with the 1991 Standards.</p><p class="depth0">The ADA is silent on the issue of ``grandfathering'' or establishing  a safe harbor for measuring compliance in situations where the covered  entity is not undertaking a planned alteration to specific building  elements. The ADA delegates to the Attorney General the responsibility  for issuing regulations that define the parameters of covered entities'  obligations when the statute does not directly address an issue. This  regulation implements that delegation of authority.</p><p class="depth0">One commenter proposed that a previous record of barrier removal be  one of the factors in determining, prospectively, what renders a  facility, when viewed in its entirety, usable and accessible to persons  with disabilities. Another commenter asked the Department to clarify, at  a minimum, that to the extent compliance with the 1991 Standards does  not provide program access, particularly with regard to areas not  specifically addressed in the 1991 Standards, the safe harbor will not  operate to relieve an entity of its obligations to provide program  access.</p><p class="depth0">One commenter supported the proposal to add a safe harbor for path  of travel.</p><p class="depth0">The final rule retains the safe harbor for required elements of a  path of travel to altered primary function areas for public entities  that have already complied with the 1991 Standards with respect to those  required elements. The Department believes that this safe harbor strikes  an appropriate balance between ensuring that individuals with  disabilities are provided access to buildings and facilities and  potential financial burdens on existing public entities that are  undertaking alterations subject to the 2010 Standards. This safe harbor  is not a blanket exemption for facilities. If a public entity undertakes  an alteration to a primary function area, only the required elements of  a path of travel to that area that already comply with the 1991  Standards are subject to the safe harbor. If a public entity undertakes  an alteration to a primary function area and the required elements of a  path of travel to the altered area do not comply with the 1991  Standards, then the public entity must bring those elements into  compliance with the 2010 Standards.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(b)(3) Alterations to historic facilities</p><p class="depth0">The final rule renumbers the requirements for alterations to  historic facilities enumerated in current Sec.  35.151(d)(1) and (2) as  Sec.  35.151(b)(3)(i) and (ii). Currently, the regulation provides that  alterations to historic facilities shall comply to the maximum extent  feasible with section 4.1.7 of UFAS or section 4.1.7 of the 1991  Standards. See 28 CFR 35.151(d)(1). Section 35.151(b)(3)(i) of the final  rule eliminates the option of using UFAS for alterations that commence  on or after March 15, 2012. The substantive requirement in current Sec.   35.151(d)(2)--that alternative methods of access shall be provided  pursuant to the requirements of Sec.  35.150 if it is not feasible to  provide physical access to an historic property in a manner that will  not threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or  facility--is contained in Sec.  35.151(b)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(c) Accessibility standards for new construction and</p><p class="depth0">alterations</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(c) of the NPRM proposed to adopt ADA Chapter 1, ADA  Chapter 2, and Chapters 3 through 10 of the Americans with Disabilities  Act and Architectural Barriers Act Guidelines (2004 ADAAG) into the ADA  Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards). As the Department has  noted, the development of these standards represents the culmination of  a lengthy effort by the Access Board to update its guidelines, to make  the Federal guidelines consistent to the extent permitted by law, and to  harmonize the Federal requirements with the private sector model codes  that form the basis of many State and local building code requirements.  The full text of the 2010 Standards is available for public review on  the ADA Home Page (http://www.ada.gov) and on the Access Board's Web  site (http://www.access-board.gov/gs.htm) (last visited June 24, 2010).  The Access Board site also includes an extensive discussion of the  development of the 2004 ADA/ABA Guidelines, and a detailed comparison of  the 1991 Standards, the 2004 ADA/ABA Guidelines, and the 2003  International Building Code.</p><p class="depth0">Section 204 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12134, directs the Attorney  General to issue regulations to implement title II that are consistent  with the minimum guidelines published by the Access Board. The Attorney  General (or his designee) is a statutory member of the Access Board (see  29 U.S.C. 792(a)(1)(B(vii)) and was involved in the development of the  2004 ADAAG. Nevertheless, during the process of drafting the NPRM, the  Department reviewed the 2004 ADAAG to determine if additional regulatory  provisions were necessary. As a result of this review, the Department  decided to propose new sections, which were contained in Sec.   35.151(e)-(h) of the NPRM, to clarify how the Department will apply the  proposed standards to social service center establishments, housing at  places of education, assembly areas, and medical care facilities. Each  of these provisions is discussed below.</p><p class="depth0">Congress anticipated that there would be a need for close  coordination of the ADA building requirements with State and local  building code requirements. Therefore, the ADA authorized the Attorney  General to establish an ADA code certification process under title III  of the ADA. That process is addressed in 28 CFR part 36, subpart F.  Revisions to that process are addressed in the regulation amending the  title III regulation published elsewhere in the Federal Register today.  In addition, the Department operates an extensive technical assistance  program. The Department anticipates that once this rule is final,  revised technical assistance material will be issued to provide guidance  about its implementation.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(c) of the 1991 title II regulation establishes two  standards for accessible new construction and alteration. Under  paragraph (c), design, construction, or alteration of facilities in  conformance with UFAS or with the 1991 Standards (which, at the time of  the publication of the rule were also referred to as the Americans with  Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities  (1991 ADAAG)) is deemed to comply with the requirements of this section  with respect to those facilities (except that if the 1991 Standards are  chosen, the elevator exemption does not apply). The 1991 Standards were  based on the 1991 ADAAG, which was initially developed by the Access  Board as guidelines for the accessibility of buildings and facilities  that are subject to title III. The Department adopted the 1991 ADAAG as  the standards for places of public accommodation and commercial  facilities under title III of the ADA and it was published as Appendix A  to the Department's regulation implementing title III, 56 FR 35592 (July  26, 1991) as amended, 58 FR 17522 (April 5, 1993), and as further  amended, 59 FR 2675 (Jan. 18, 1994), codified at 28 CFR part 36 (2009).</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(c) of the final rule adopts the 2010 Standards and  establishes the compliance date and triggering events for the  application of those standards to both new construction and alterations.  Appendix B of the final title III rule (Analysis and Commentary on the  2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design) (which will be published today  elsewhere in this volume and codified as Appendix B to 28 CFR part 36)  provides a description of the major changes in the 2010 Standards (as  compared to the 1991 ADAAG) and a discussion of the public comments that  the Department received on specific sections of the 2004 ADAAG. A number  of commenters asked the Department to revise certain provisions in the  2004 ADAAG in a manner that would reduce either the required scoping or  specific technical accessibility requirements. As previously stated,  although the ADA requires the enforceable standards issued by the  Department under title II and title III to be consistent with the  minimum guidelines published by the Access Board, it is the sole  responsibility of the Attorney General to promulgate standards and to  interpret and enforce those standards. The guidelines adopted by the  Access Board are ``minimum guidelines.'' 42 U.S.C. 12186(c).</p><p class="depth0">Compliance date. When the ADA was enacted, the effective dates for  various provisions were delayed in order to provide time for covered  entities to become familiar with their new obligations. Titles II and  III of the ADA generally became effective on January 26, 1992, six  months after the regulations were published. See 42 U.S.C. 12131 note;  42 U.S.C. 12181 note. New construction under title II and alterations  under either title II or title III had to comply with the design  standards on that date. See 42 U.S.C. 12183(a)(1). For new construction  under title III, the requirements applied to facilities designed and  constructed for first occupancy after January 26, 1993--18 months after  the 1991 Standards were published by the Department. In the NPRM, the  Department proposed to amend Sec.  35.151(c)(1) by revising the current  language to limit the application of the 1991 standards to facilities on  which construction commences within six months of the final rule  adopting revised standards. The NPRM also proposed adding paragraph  (c)(2) to Sec.  35.151, which states that facilities on which  construction commences on or after the date six months following the  effective date of the final rule shall comply with the proposed  standards adopted by that rule.</p><p class="depth0">As a result, under the NPRM, for the first six months after the  effective date, public entities would have the option to use either UFAS  or the 1991 Standards and be in compliance with title II. Six months  after the effective date of the rule, the new standards would take  effect. At that time, construction in accordance with UFAS would no  longer satisfy ADA requirements. The Department   stated that in order to avoid placing the burden of complying with both  standards on public entities, the Department would coordinate a  government-wide effort to revise Federal agencies' section 504  regulations to adopt the 2004 ADAAG as the standard for new construction  and alterations.</p><p class="depth0">The purpose of the proposed six-month delay in requiring compliance  with the 2010 Standards was to allow covered entities a reasonable grace  period to transition between the existing and the proposed standards.  For that reason, if a title II entity preferred to use the 2010  Standards as the standard for new construction or alterations commenced  within the six-month period after the effective date of the final rule,  such entity would be considered in compliance with title II of the ADA.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received a number of comments about the proposed six- month effective date for the title II regulation that were similar in  content to those received on this issue for the proposed title III  regulation. Several commenters supported the six-month effective date.  One commenter stated that any revisions to its State building code  becomes effective six months after adoption and that this has worked  well. In addition, this commenter stated that since 2004 ADAAG is  similar to IBC 2006 and ICC/ANSI A117.1-2003, the transition should be  easy. By contrast, another commenter advocated for a minimum 12-month  effective date, arguing that a shorter effective date could cause  substantial economic hardships to many cities and towns because of the  lengthy lead time necessary for construction projects. This commenter  was concerned that a six-month effective date could lead to projects  having to be completely redrawn, rebid, and rescheduled to ensure  compliance with the new standards. Other commenters advocated that the  effective date be extended to at least 18 months after the publication  of the rule. One of these commenters expressed concern that the kinds of  bureaucratic organizations subject to the title II regulations lack the  internal resources to quickly evaluate the regulatory changes, determine  whether they are currently compliant with the 1991 standards, and  determine what they have to do to comply with the new standards. The  other commenter argued that 18 months is the minimum amount of time  necessary to ensure that projects that have already been designed and  approved do not have to undergo costly design revisions at taxpayer  expense.</p><p class="depth0">The Department is persuaded by the concerns raised by commenters for  both the title II and III regulations that the six-month compliance date  proposed in the NPRM for application of the 2010 Standards may be too  short for certain projects that are already in the midst of the design  and permitting process. The Department has determined that for new  construction and alterations, compliance with the 2010 Standards will  not be required until 18 months from the date the final rule is  published. Until the time compliance with the 2010 Standards is  required, public entities will have the option of complying with the  2010 Standards, the UFAS, or the 1991 Standards. However, public  entities that choose to comply with the 2010 Standards in lieu of the  1991 Standards or UFAS prior to the compliance date described in this  rule must choose one of the three standards, and may not rely on some of  the requirements contained in one standard and some of the requirements  contained in the other standards.</p><p class="depth0">Triggering event. In Sec.  35.151(c)(2) of the NPRM, the Department  proposed that the commencement of construction serve as the triggering  event for applying the proposed standards to new construction and  alterations under title II. This language is consistent with the  triggering event set forth in Sec.  35.151(a) of the 1991 title II  regulation. The Department received only four comments on this section  of the title II rule. Three commenters supported the use of ``start of  construction'' as the triggering event. One commenter argued that the  Department should use the ``last building permit or start of physical  construction, whichever comes first,'' stating that ``altering a design  after a building permit has been issued can be an undue burden.''</p><p class="depth0">After considering these comments, the Department has decided to  continue to use the commencement of physical construction as the  triggering event for application of the 2010 Standards for entities  covered by title II. The Department has also added clarifying language  at Sec.  35.151(c)(4) to the regulation to make it clear that the date  of ceremonial groundbreaking or the date a structure is razed to make it  possible for construction of a facility to take place does not qualify  as the commencement of physical construction.</p><p class="depth0">Section 234 of the 2010 Standards provides accessibility guidelines  for newly designed and constructed amusement rides. The amusement ride  provisions do not provide a ``triggering event'' for new construction or  alteration of an amusement ride. An industry commenter requested that  the triggering event of ``first use,'' as noted in the Advisory note to  section 234.1 of the 2004 ADAAG, be included in the final rule. The  Advisory note provides that ``[a] custom designed and constructed ride  is new upon its first use, which is the first time amusement park  patrons take the ride.'' The Department declines to treat amusement  rides differently than other types of new construction and alterations.  Under the final rule, they are subject to Sec.  35.151(c). Thus, newly  constructed and altered amusement rides shall comply with the 2010  Standards if the start of physical construction or the alteration is on  or after 18 months from the publication date of this   rule. The Department also notes that section 234.4.2 of the 2010  Standards only applies where the structural or operational  characteristics of an amusement ride are altered. It does not apply in  cases where the only change to a ride is the theme.</p><p class="depth0">Noncomplying new construction and alterations. The element-by- element safe harbor referenced in Sec.  35.150(b)(2) has no effect on  new or altered elements in existing facilities that were subject to the  1991 Standards or UFAS on the date that they were constructed or  altered, but do not comply with the technical and scoping specifications  for those elements in the 1991 Standards or UFAS. Section 35.151(c)(5)  of the final rule sets forth the rules for noncompliant new construction  or alterations in facilities that were subject to the requirements of  this part. Under those provisions, noncomplying new construction and  alterations constructed or altered after the effective date of the  applicable ADA requirements and before March 15, 2012 shall, before  March 15, 2012, be made accessible in accordance with either the 1991  Standards, UFAS, or the 2010 Standards. Noncomplying new construction  and alterations constructed or altered after the effective date of the  applicable ADA requirements and before March 15, 2012, shall, on or  after March 15, 2012 be made accessible in accordance with the 2010  Standards.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(d) Scope of coverage</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed a new provision, Sec.   35.151(d), to clarify that the requirements established by Sec.  35.151,  including those contained in the 2004 ADAAG, prescribe what is necessary  to ensure that buildings and facilities, including fixed or built-in  elements in new or altered facilities, are accessible to individuals  with disabilities. Once the construction or alteration of a facility has  been completed, all other aspects of programs, services, and activities  conducted in that facility are subject to the operational requirements  established in this final rule. Although the Department may use the  requirements of the 2010 Standards as a guide to determining when and  how to make equipment and furnishings accessible, those determinations  fall within the discretionary authority of the Department.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also wishes to clarify that the advisory notes,  appendix notes, and figures that accompany the 1991 and 2010 Standards  do not establish separately enforceable requirements unless specifically  stated otherwise in the text of the standards. This clarification has  been made to address concerns expressed by ANPRM commenters who  mistakenly believed that the advisory notes in the 2004 ADAAG  established requirements beyond those established in the text of the  guidelines (e.g., Advisory 504.4 suggests, but does not require, that  covered entities provide visual contrast on stair tread nosing to make  them more visible to individuals with low vision). The Department  received no significant comments on this section and it is unchanged in  the final rule.</p><p class="depth0">Definitions of residential facilities and transient lodging. The  2010 Standards add a definition of ``residential dwelling unit'' and  modify the current definition of ``transient lodging.'' Under section  106.5 of the 2010 Standards, ``residential dwelling unit'' is defined as  ``[a] unit intended to be used as a residence, that is primarily long- term in nature'' and does not include transient lodging, inpatient  medical care, licensed long-term care, and detention or correctional  facilities. Additionally, section 106.5 of the 2010 Standards changes  the definition of ``transient lodging'' to a building or facility  ``containing one or more guest room(s) for sleeping that provides  accommodations that are primarily short-term in nature.'' ``Transient  lodging'' does not include residential dwelling units intended to be  used as a residence. The references to ``dwelling units'' and  ``dormitories'' that are in the definition of the 1991 Standards are  omitted from the 2010 Standards.</p><p class="depth0">The comments about the application of transient lodging or  residential standards to social service center establishments, and  housing at a place of education are addressed separately below. The  Department received one additional comment on this issue from an  organization representing emergency response personnel seeking an  exemption from the transient lodging accessibility requirements for crew  quarters and common use areas serving those crew quarters (e.g., locker  rooms, exercise rooms, day room) that are used exclusively by on-duty  emergency response personnel and that are not used for any public  purpose. The commenter argued that since emergency response personnel  must meet certain physical qualifications that have the effect of  exempting persons with mobility disabilities, there is no need to build  crew quarters and common use areas serving those crew quarters to meet  the 2004 ADAAG. In addition, the commenter argued that applying the  transient lodging standards would impose significant costs and create  living space that is less usable for most emergency response personnel.</p><p class="depth0">The ADA does not exempt spaces because of a belief or policy that  excludes persons with disabilities from certain work. However, the  Department believes that crew quarters that are used exclusively as a  residence by emergency response personnel and the kitchens and bathrooms  exclusively serving those quarters are more like residential dwelling  units and are therefore covered by the residential dwelling standards in  the 2010   Standards, not the transient lodging standards. The residential dwelling  standards address most of the concerns of the commenter. For example,  the commenter was concerned that sinks in kitchens and lavatories in  bathrooms that are accessible under the transient lodging standards  would be too low to be comfortably used by emergency response personnel.  The residential dwelling standards allow such features to be adaptable  so that they would not have to be lowered until accessibility was  needed. Similarly, grab bars and shower seats would not have to be  installed at the time of construction provided that reinforcement has  been installed in walls and located so as to permit their installation  at a later date.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(e) Social service center establishments</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed a new Sec.  35.151(e) requiring  group homes, halfway houses, shelters, or similar social service center  establishments that provide temporary sleeping accommodations or  residential dwelling units to comply with the provisions of the 2004  ADAAG that apply to residential facilities, including, but not limited  to, the provisions in sections 233 and 809.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM explained that this proposal was based on two important  changes in the 2004 ADAAG. First, for the first time, residential  dwelling units are explicitly covered in the 2004 ADAAG in section 233.  Second, the 2004 ADAAG eliminates the language contained in the 1991  Standards addressing scoping and technical requirements for homeless  shelters, group homes, and similar social service center establishments.  Currently, such establishments are covered in section 9.5 of the  transient lodging section of the 1991 Standards. The deletion of section  9.5 creates an ambiguity of coverage that must be addressed.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM explained the Department's belief that transferring  coverage of social service center establishments from the transient  lodging standards to the residential facilities standards would  alleviate conflicting requirements for social service center providers.  The Department believes that a substantial percentage of social service  center establishments are recipients of Federal financial assistance  from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also provides financial  assistance for the operation of shelters through the Administration for  Children and Families programs. As such, these establishments are  covered both by the ADA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. UFAS  is currently the design standard for new construction and alterations  for entities subject to section 504. The two design standards for  accessibility--the 1991 Standards and UFAS--have confronted many social  service providers with separate, and sometimes conflicting, requirements  for design and construction of facilities. To resolve these conflicts,  the residential facilities standards in the 2004 ADAAG have been  coordinated with the section 504 requirements. The transient lodging  standards, however, are not similarly coordinated. The deletion of  section 9.5 of the 1991 Standards from the 2004 ADAAG presented two  options: (1) Require coverage under the transient lodging standards, and  subject such facilities to separate, conflicting requirements for design  and construction; or (2) require coverage under the residential  facilities standards, which would harmonize the regulatory requirements  under the ADA and section 504. The Department chose the option that  harmonizes the regulatory requirements: coverage under the residential  facilities standards.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department expressed concern that the residential  facilities standards do not include a requirement for clear floor space  next to beds similar to the requirement in the transient lodging  standards and as a result, the Department proposed adding a provision  that would require certain social service center establishments that  provide sleeping rooms with more than 25 beds to ensure that a minimum  of 5 percent of the beds have clear floor space in accordance with  section 806.2.3 or of the 2004 ADAAG.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department requested information from providers who  operate homeless shelters, transient group homes, halfway houses, and  other social service center establishments, and from the clients of  these facilities who would be affected by this proposed change, asking,  ``[t]o what extent have conflicts between the ADA and section 504  affected these facilities? What would be the effect of applying the  residential dwelling unit requirements to these facilities, rather than  the requirements for transient lodging guest rooms?'' 73 FR 34466, 34491  (June 17, 2008).</p><p class="depth0">Many of the commenters supported applying the residential facilities  requirements to social service center establishments, stating that even  though the residential facilities requirements are less demanding in  some instances, the existence of one clear standard will result in an  overall increased level of accessibility by eliminating the confusion  and inaction that are sometimes caused by the current existence of  multiple requirements. One commenter also stated that ``it makes sense  to treat social service center establishments like residential  facilities because this is how these establishments function in  practice.''</p><p class="depth0">Two commenters agreed with applying the residential facilities  requirements to social service center establishments but recommended  adding a requirement for various   bathing options, such as a roll-in shower (which is not required under  the residential standards).</p><p class="depth0">One commenter objected to the change and asked the Department to  require that social service center establishments continue to comply  with the transient lodging standards. One commenter stated that it did  not agree that the standards for residential coverage would serve  persons with disabilities as well as the 1991 transient lodging  standards. This commenter expressed concern that the Department had  eliminated guidance for social service agencies and that the rule should  be put on hold until those safeguards are restored. Another commenter  argued that the rule that would provide the greatest access for persons  with disabilities should prevail.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters argued for the application of the transient  lodging standards to all social service center establishments except  those that were ``intended as a person's place of abode,'' referencing  the Department's question related to the definition of ``place of  lodging'' in the title III NPRM. One commenter stated that the  International Building Code requires accessible units in all transient  facilities. The commenter expressed concern that group homes should be  built to be accessible, rather than adaptable.</p><p class="depth0">The Department continues to be concerned about alleviating the  challenges for social service providers that are also subject to section  504 and would likely be subject to conflicting requirements if the  transient lodging standards were applied. Thus, the Department has  retained the requirement that social service center establishments  comply with the residential dwelling standards. The Department believes,  however, that social service center establishments that provide  emergency shelter to large transient populations should be able to  provide bathing facilities that are accessible to persons with mobility  disabilities who need roll-in showers. Because of the transient nature  of the population of these large shelters, it will not be feasible to  modify bathing facilities in a timely manner when faced with a need to  provide a roll-in shower with a seat when requested by an overnight  visitor. As a result, the Department has added a requirement that social  service center establishments with sleeping accommodations for more than  50 individuals must provide at least one roll-in shower with a seat that  complies with the relevant provisions of section 608 of the 2010  Standards. Transfer-type showers are not permitted in lieu of a roll-in  shower with a seat and the exceptions in sections 608.3 and 608.4 for  residential dwelling units are not permitted. When separate shower  facilities are provided for men and for women, at least one roll-in  shower shall be provided for each group. This supplemental requirement  to the residential facilities standards is in addition to the  supplemental requirement that was proposed in the NPRM for clear floor  space in sleeping rooms with more than 25 beds.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also notes that while dwelling units at some social  service center establishments are also subject to the Fair Housing Act  (FHAct) design and construction requirements that require certain  features of adaptable and accessible design, FHAct units do not provide  the same level of accessibility that is required for residential  facilities under the 2010 Standards. The FHAct requirements, where also  applicable, should not be considered a substitute for the 2010  Standards. Rather, the 2010 Standards must be followed in addition to  the FHAct requirements.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also notes that whereas the NPRM used the term  ``social service establishment,'' the final rule uses the term ``social  service center establishment.'' The Department has made this editorial  change so that the final rule is consistent with the terminology used in  the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. 12181(7)(k).</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(f) Housing at a place of education</p><p class="depth0">The Department of Justice and the Department of Education share  responsibility for regulation and enforcement of the ADA in  postsecondary educational settings, including its requirements for  architectural features. In addition, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD) has enforcement responsibility for housing subject to  title II of the ADA. Housing facilities in educational settings range  from traditional residence halls and dormitories to apartment or  townhouse-style residences. In addition to title II of the ADA, public  universities and schools that receive Federal financial assistance are  also subject to section 504, which contains its own accessibility  requirements through the application of UFAS. Residential housing in an  educational setting is also covered by the FHAct, which requires newly  constructed multifamily housing to include certain features of  accessible and adaptable design. Covered entities subject to the ADA  must always be aware of, and comply with, any other Federal statutes or  regulations that govern the operation of residential properties.</p><p class="depth0">Although the 1991 Standards mention dormitories as a form of  transient lodging, they do not specifically address how the ADA applies  to dormitories or other types of residential housing provided in an  educational setting. The 1991 Standards also do not contain any specific  provisions for residential facilities, allowing covered entities to  elect to follow the residential standards contained in UFAS. Although  the 2004 ADAAG contains provisions for both residential facilities and  transient lodging, the guidelines do not indicate which requirements  apply to housing provided in an educational setting, leaving it   to the adopting agencies to make that choice. After evaluating both sets  of standards, the Department concluded that the benefits of applying the  transient lodging standards outweighed the benefits of applying the  residential facilities standards. Consequently, in the NPRM, the  Department proposed a new Sec.  35.151(f) that provided that residence  halls or dormitories operated by or on behalf of places of education  shall comply with the provisions of the proposed standards for transient  lodging, including, but not limited to, the provisions in sections 224  and 806 of the 2004 ADAAG.</p><p class="depth0">Both public and private school housing facilities have varied  characteristics. College and university housing facilities typically  provide housing for up to one academic year, but may be closed during  school vacation periods. In the summer, they are often used for short- term stays of one to three days, a week, or several months. Graduate and  faculty housing is often provided year-round in the form of apartments,  which may serve individuals or families with children. These housing  facilities are diverse in their layout. Some are double-occupancy rooms  with a shared toilet and bathing room, which may be inside or outside  the unit. Others may contain cluster, suite, or group arrangements where  several rooms are located inside a defined unit with bathing, kitchen,  and similar common facilities. In some cases, these suites are  indistinguishable in features from traditional apartments. Universities  may build their own housing facilities or enter into agreements with  private developers to build, own, or lease housing to the educational  institution or to its students. Academic housing may be located on the  campus of the university or may be located in nearby neighborhoods.</p><p class="depth0">Throughout the school year and the summer, academic housing can  become program areas in which small groups meet, receptions and  educational sessions are held, and social activities occur. The ability  to move between rooms--both accessible rooms and standard rooms--in  order to socialize, to study, and to use all public use and common use  areas is an essential part of having access to these educational  programs and activities. Academic housing is also used for short-term  transient educational programs during the time students are not in  regular residence and may be rented out to transient visitors in a  manner similar to a hotel for special university functions.</p><p class="depth0">The Department was concerned that applying the new construction  requirements for residential facilities to educational housing  facilities could hinder access to educational programs for students with  disabilities. Elevators are not generally required under the 2004 ADAAG  residential facilities standards unless they are needed to provide an  accessible route from accessible units to public use and common use  areas, while under the 2004 ADAAG as it applies to other types of  facilities, multistory public facilities must have elevators unless they  meet very specific exceptions. In addition, the residential facilities  standards do not require accessible roll-in showers in bathrooms, while  the transient lodging requirements require some of the accessible units  to be served by bathrooms with roll-in showers. The transient lodging  standards also require that a greater number of units have accessible  features for persons with communication disabilities. The transient  lodging standards provide for installation of the required accessible  features so that they are available immediately, but the residential  facilities standards allow for certain features of the unit to be  adaptable. For example, only reinforcements for grab bars need to be  provided in residential dwellings, but the actual grab bars must be  installed under the transient lodging standards. By contrast, the  residential facilities standards do require certain features that  provide greater accessibility within units, such as more usable  kitchens, and an accessible route throughout the dwelling. The  residential facilities standards also require 5 percent of the units to  be accessible to persons with mobility disabilities, which is a  continuation of the same scoping that is currently required under UFAS,  and is therefore applicable to any educational institution that is  covered by section 504. The transient lodging standards require a lower  percentage of accessible sleeping rooms for facilities with large  numbers of rooms than is required by UFAS. For example, if a dormitory  had 150 rooms, the transient lodging standards would require seven  accessible rooms while the residential standards would require eight. In  a large dormitory with 500 rooms, the transient lodging standards would  require 13 accessible rooms and the residential facilities standards  would require 25. There are other differences between the two sets of  standards as well with respect to requirements for accessible windows,  alterations, kitchens, accessible route throughout a unit, and clear  floor space in bathrooms allowing for a side transfer.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department requested public comment on how to scope  educational housing facilities, asking, ``[w]ould the residential  facility requirements or the transient lodging requirements in the 2004  ADAAG be more appropriate for housing at places of education? How would  the different requirements affect the cost when building new dormitories  and other student housing?'' 73 FR 34466, 34492 (June 17, 2008).</p><p class="depth0">The vast majority of the comments received by the Department  advocated using the residential facilities standards for housing at a  place of education instead of the transient lodging standards, arguing  that housing at places of public education are in   fact homes for the students who live in them. These commenters argued,  however, that the Department should impose a requirement for a variety  of options for accessible bathing and should ensure that all floors of  dormitories be accessible so that students with disabilities have the  same opportunities to participate in the life of the dormitory community  that are provided to students without disabilities. Commenters  representing persons with disabilities and several individuals argued  that, although the transient lodging standards may provide a few more  accessible features (such as roll-in showers), the residential  facilities standards would ensure that students with disabilities have  access to all rooms in their assigned unit, not just to the sleeping  room, kitchenette, and wet bar. One commenter stated that, in its view,  the residential facilities standards were congruent with overlapping  requirements from HUD, and that access provided by the residential  facilities requirements within alterations would ensure dispersion of  accessible features more effectively. This commenter also argued that  while the increased number of required accessible units for residential  facilities as compared to transient lodging may increase the cost of  construction or alteration, this cost would be offset by a reduced need  to adapt rooms later if the demand for accessible rooms exceeds the  supply. The commenter also encouraged the Department to impose a  visitability (accessible doorways and necessary clear floor space for  turning radius) requirement for both the residential facilities and  transient lodging requirements to allow students with mobility  impairments to interact and socialize in a fully integrated fashion.</p><p class="depth0">Two commenters supported the Department's proposed approach. One  commenter argued that the transient lodging requirements in the 2004  ADAAG would provide greater accessibility and increase the opportunity  of students with disabilities to participate fully in campus life. A  second commenter generally supported the provision of accessible  dwelling units at places of education, and pointed out that the relevant  scoping in the International Building Code requires accessible units  ``consistent with hotel accommodations.''</p><p class="depth0">The Department has considered the comments recommending the use of  the residential facilities standards and acknowledges that they require  certain features that are not included in the transient lodging  standards and that should be required for housing provided at a place of  education. In addition, the Department notes that since educational  institutions often use their academic housing facilities as short-term  transient lodging in the summers, it is important that accessible  features be installed at the outset. It is not realistic to expect that  the educational institution will be able to adapt a unit in a timely  manner in order to provide accessible accommodations to someone  attending a one-week program during the summer.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has determined that the best approach to this type of  housing is to continue to require the application of transient lodging  standards, but at the same time to add several requirements drawn from  the residential facilities standards related to accessible turning  spaces and work surfaces in kitchens, and the accessible route  throughout the unit. This will ensure the maintenance of the transient  lodging standard requirements related to access to all floors of the  facility, roll-in showers in facilities with more than 50 sleeping  rooms, and other important accessibility features not found in the  residential facilities standards, but will also ensure usable kitchens  and access to all the rooms in a suite or apartment.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has added a new definition to Sec.  35.104, ``Housing  at a Place of Education,'' and has revised Sec.  35.151(f) to reflect  the accessible features that now will be required in addition to the  requirements set forth under the transient lodging standards. The  Department also recognizes that some educational institutions provide  some residential housing on a year-round basis to graduate students and  staff which is comparable to private rental housing, and which contains  no facilities for educational programming. Section 35.151(f)(3) exempts  from the transient lodging standards apartments or townhouse facilities  provided by or on behalf of a place of education that are leased on a  year-round basis exclusively to graduate students or faculty, and do not  contain any public use or common use areas available for educational  programming; instead, such housing shall comply with the requirements  for residential facilities in sections 233 and 809 of the 2010  Standards.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(f) uses the term ``sleeping room'' in lieu of the  term ``guest room,'' which is the term used in the transient lodging  standards. The Department is using this term because it believes that,  for the most part, it provides a better description of the sleeping  facilities used in a place of education than ``guest room.'' The final  rule states that the Department intends the terms to be used  interchangeably in the application of the transient lodging standards to  housing at a place of education.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(g) Assembly areas</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed Sec.  35.151(g) to supplement  the assembly area requirements of the 2004 ADAAG, which the Department  is adopting as part of the 2010 Standards. The NPRM proposed at Sec.   35.151(g)(1) to require wheelchair spaces and companion seating  locations to be dispersed to all levels of the facility and are served  by   an accessible route. The Department received no significant comments on  this paragraph and has decided to adopt the proposed language with minor  modifications. The Department has retained the substance of this section  in the final rule but has clarified that the requirement applies to  stadiums, arenas, and grandstands. In addition, the Department has  revised the phrase ``wheelchair and companion seating locations'' to  ``wheelchair spaces and companion seats.''</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(g)(1) ensures that there is greater dispersion of  wheelchair spaces and companion seats throughout stadiums, arenas, and  grandstands than would otherwise be required by sections 221 and 802 of  the 2004 ADAAG. In some cases, the accessible route may not be the same  route that other individuals use to reach their seats. For example, if  other patrons reach their seats on the field by an inaccessible route  (e.g., by stairs), but there is an accessible route that complies with  section 206.3 of the 2010 Standards that could be connected to seats on  the field, wheelchair spaces and companion seats must be placed on the  field even if that route is not generally available to the public.</p><p class="depth0">Regulatory language that was included in the 2004 ADAAG advisory,  but that did not appear in the NPRM, has been added by the Department in  Sec.  35.151(g)(2). Section 35.151(g)(2) now requires an assembly area  that has seating encircling, in whole or in part, a field of play or  performance area such as an arena or stadium, to place wheelchair spaces  and companion seats around the entire facility. This rule, which is  designed to prevent a public entity from placing wheelchair spaces and  companion seats on one side of the facility only, is consistent with the  Department's enforcement practices and reflects its interpretation of  section 4.33.3 of the 1991 Standards.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed Sec.  35.151(g)(2) which  prohibits wheelchair spaces and companion seating locations from being  ``located on, (or obstructed by) temporary platforms or other moveable  structures.'' Through its enforcement actions, the Department discovered  that some venues place wheelchair spaces and companion seats on  temporary platforms that, when removed, reveal conventional seating  underneath, or cover the wheelchair spaces and companion seats with  temporary platforms on top of which they place risers of conventional  seating. These platforms cover groups of conventional seats and are used  to provide groups of wheelchair seats and companion seats.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters requested an exception to the prohibition of the  use of temporary platforms for public entities that sell most of their  tickets on a season-ticket or other multi-event basis. Such commenters  argued that they should be able to use temporary platforms because they  know, in advance, that the patrons sitting in certain areas for the  whole season do not need wheelchair spaces and companion seats. The  Department declines to adopt such an exception. As it explained in  detail in the NPRM, the Department believes that permitting the use of  movable platforms that seat four or more wheelchair users and their  companions have the potential to reduce the number of available  wheelchair seating spaces below the level required, thus reducing the  opportunities for persons who need accessible seating to have the same  choice of ticket prices and amenities that are available to other  patrons in the facility. In addition, use of removable platforms may  result in instances where last minute requests for wheelchair and  companion seating cannot be met because entire sections of accessible  seating will be lost when a platform is removed. See 73 FR 34466, 34493  (June 17, 2008). Further, use of temporary platforms allows facilities  to limit persons who need accessible seating to certain seating areas,  and to relegate accessible seating to less desirable locations. The use  of temporary platforms has the effect of neutralizing dispersion and  other seating requirements (e.g., line of sight) for wheelchair spaces  and companion seats. Cf. Independent Living Resources v. Oregon Arena  Corp., 1 F. Supp. 2d 1159, 1171 (D. Or. 1998) (holding that while a  public accommodation may ``infill'' wheelchair spaces with removable  seats when the wheelchair spaces are not needed to accommodate  individuals with disabilities, under certain circumstances ``[s]uch a  practice might well violate the rule that wheelchair spaces must be  dispersed throughout the arena in a manner that is roughly proportionate  to the overall distribution of seating''). In addition, using temporary  platforms to convert unsold wheelchair spaces to conventional seating  undermines the flexibility facilities need to accommodate secondary  ticket markets exchanges as required by Sec.  35.138(g) of the final  rule.</p><p class="depth0">As the Department explained in the NPRM, however, this provision was  not designed to prohibit temporary seating that increases seating for  events (e.g., placing temporary seating on the floor of a basketball  court for a concert). Consequently, the final rule, at Sec.   35.151(g)(3), has been amended to clarify that if an entire seating  section is on a temporary platform for a particular event, then  wheelchair spaces and companion seats may be in that seating section.  However, adding a temporary platform to create wheelchair spaces and  companion seats that are otherwise dissimilar from nearby fixed seating  and then simply adding a small number of additional seats to the  platform would not qualify as an ``entire seating section'' on the  platform. In addition, Sec.  35.151(g)(3) clarifies that facilities may  fill in wheelchair   spaces with removable seats when the wheelchair spaces are not needed by  persons who use wheelchairs.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has been responsive to assembly areas' concerns about  reduced revenues due to unused accessible seating. Accordingly, the  Department has reduced scoping requirements significantly--by almost  half in large assembly areas--and determined that allowing assembly  areas to infill unsold wheelchair spaces with readily removable  temporary individual seats appropriately balances their economic  concerns with the rights of individuals with disabilities. See section  221.2 of the 2010 Standards.</p><p class="depth0">For stadium-style movie theaters, in Sec.  35.151(g)(4) of the NPRM  the Department proposed requiring placement of wheelchair seating spaces  and companion seats on a riser or cross-aisle in the stadium section of  the theater and placement of such seating so that it satisfies at least  one of the following criteria: (1) It is located within the rear 60  percent of the seats provided in the auditorium; or (2) it is located  within the area of the auditorium where the vertical viewing angles are  between the 40th to 100th percentile of vertical viewing angles for all  seats in that theater as ranked from the first row (1st percentile) to  the back row (100th percentile). The vertical viewing angle is the angle  between a horizontal line perpendicular to the seated viewer's eye to  the screen and a line from the seated viewer's eye to the top of the  screen.</p><p class="depth0">The Department proposed this bright-line rule for two reasons: (1)  The movie theater industry petitioned for such a rule; and (2) the  Department has acquired expertise on the design of stadium style  theaters from litigation against several major movie theater chains. See  U.S. v. AMC Entertainment, 232 F. Supp. 2d 1092 (C.D. Ca. 2002), rev'd  in part, 549 F. 3d 760 (9th Cir. 2008); U.S. v. Cinemark USA, Inc., 348  F. 3d 569 (6th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 542 U.S. 937 (2004). Two  industry commenters--at least one of whom otherwise supported this  rule--requested that the Department explicitly state that this rule does  not apply retroactively to existing theaters. Although this rule on its  face applies to new construction and alterations, these commenters were  concerned that the rule could be interpreted to apply retroactively  because of the Department's statement in the ANPRM that this bright-line  rule, although newly-articulated, does not represent a ``substantive  change from the existing line-of-sight requirements'' of section 4.33.3  of the 1991 Standards. See 69 FR 58768, 58776 (Sept. 30, 2004).</p><p class="depth0">Although the Department intends for Sec.  35.151(g)(4) of this rule  to apply prospectively to new construction and alterations, this rule is  not a departure from, and is consistent with, the line-of-sight  requirements in the 1991 Standards. The Department has always  interpreted the line-of-sight requirements in the 1991 Standards to  require viewing angles provided to patrons who use wheelchairs to be  comparable to those afforded to other spectators. Section 35.151(g)(4)  merely represents the application of these requirements to stadium-style  movie theaters.</p><p class="depth0">One commenter from a trade association sought clarification whether  Sec.  35.151(g)(4) applies to stadium-style theaters with more than 300  seats, and argued that it should not since dispersion requirements apply  in those theaters. The Department declines to limit this rule to  stadium-style theaters with 300 or fewer seats; stadium-style theaters  of all sizes must comply with this rule. So, for example, stadium-style  theaters that must vertically disperse wheelchair and companion seats  must do so within the parameters of this rule.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM included a provision that required assembly areas with more  than 5,000 seats to provide at least five wheelchair spaces with at  least three companion seats for each of those five wheelchair spaces.  The Department agrees with commenters who asserted that group seating is  better addressed through ticketing policies rather than design and has  deleted that provision from this section of the final rule.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(h) Medical care facilities</p><p class="depth0">In the 1991 title II regulation, there was no provision addressing  the dispersion of accessible sleeping rooms in medical care facilities.  The Department is aware, however, of problems that individuals with  disabilities face in receiving full and equal medical care when  accessible sleeping rooms are not adequately dispersed. When accessible  rooms are not fully dispersed, a person with a disability is often  placed in an accessible room in an area that is not medically  appropriate for his or her condition, and is thus denied quick access to  staff with expertise in that medical specialty and specialized  equipment. While the Access Board did not establish specific design  requirements for dispersion in the 2004 ADAAG, in response to extensive  comments in support of dispersion it added an advisory note, Advisory  223.1 General, encouraging dispersion of accessible rooms within the  facility so that accessible rooms are more likely to be proximate to  appropriate qualified staff and resources.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department sought additional comment on the issue,  asking whether it should require medical care facilities, such as  hospitals, to disperse their accessible sleeping rooms, and if so, by  what method (by specialty area, floor, or other criteria). All of the  comments the Department received on this issue supported dispersing  accessible sleeping rooms proportionally by specialty area. These  comments, from individuals, organizations, and a building code   association, argued that it would not be difficult for hospitals to  disperse rooms by specialty area, given the high level of regulation to  which hospitals are subject and the planning that hospitals do based on  utilization trends. Further, commenters suggested that without a  requirement, it is unlikely that hospitals would disperse the rooms. In  addition, concentrating accessible rooms in one area perpetuates  segregation of individuals with disabilities, which is counter to the  purpose of the ADA.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has decided to require medical care facilities to  disperse their accessible sleeping rooms in a manner that is  proportionate by type of medical specialty. This does not require exact  mathematical proportionality, which at times would be impossible.  However, it does require that medical care facilities disperse their  accessible rooms by medical specialty so that persons with disabilities  can, to the extent practical, stay in an accessible room within the wing  or ward that is appropriate for their medical needs. The language used  in this rule (``in a manner that is proportionate by type of medical  specialty'') is more specific than that used in the NPRM (``in a manner  that enables patients with disabilities to have access to appropriate  specialty services'') and adopts the concept of proportionality proposed  by the commenters. Accessible rooms should be dispersed throughout all  medical specialties, such as obstetrics, orthopedics, pediatrics, and  cardiac care.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(i) Curb ramps</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(e) on curb ramps in the 1991 rule has been  redesignated as Sec.  35.151(i). In the NPRM, the Department proposed  making a minor editorial change to this section, deleting the phrase  ``other sloped areas'' from the two places in which it appears in the  1991 title II regulation. In the NPRM, the Department stated that the  phrase ``other sloped areas'' lacks technical precision. The Department  received no significant public comments on this proposal. Upon further  consideration, however, the Department has concluded that the regulation  should acknowledge that there are times when there are transitions from  sidewalk to road surface that do not technically qualify as ``curb  ramps'' (sloped surfaces that have a running slope that exceed 5  percent). Therefore, the Department has decided not to delete the phrase  ``other sloped areas.''</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(j) Residential housing for sale to individual owners</p><p class="depth0">Although public entities that operate residential housing programs  are subject to title II of the ADA, and therefore must provide  accessible residential housing, the 1991 Standards did not contain  scoping or technical standards that specifically applied to residential  housing units. As a result, under the Department's title II regulation,  these agencies had the choice of complying with UFAS, which contains  specific scoping and technical standards for residential housing units,  or applying the ADAAG transient lodging standards to their housing.  Neither UFAS nor the 1991 Standards distinguish between residential  housing provided for rent and those provided for sale to individual  owners. Thus, under the 1991 title II regulation, public entities that  construct residential housing units to be sold to individual owners must  ensure that some of those units are accessible. This requirement is in  addition to any accessibility requirements imposed on housing programs  operated by public entities that receive Federal financial assistance  from Federal agencies such as HUD.</p><p class="depth0">The 2010 Standards contain scoping and technical standards for  residential dwelling units. However, section 233.3.2 of the 2010  Standards specifically defers to the Department and to HUD, the  standard-setting agency under the ABA, to decide the appropriate scoping  for those residential dwelling units built by or on behalf of public  entities with the intent that the finished units will be sold to  individual owners. These programs include, for example, HUD's public  housing and HOME programs as well as State-funded programs to construct  units for sale to individuals. In the NPRM, the Department did not make  a specific proposal for this scoping. Instead, the Department stated  that after consultation and coordination with HUD, the Department would  make a determination in the final rule. The Department also sought  public comment on this issue stating that ``[t]he Department would  welcome recommendations from individuals with disabilities, public  housing authorities, and other interested parties that have experience  with these programs. Please comment on the appropriate scoping for  residential dwelling units built by or on behalf of public entities with  the intent that the finished units will be sold to individual owners.''  73 FR 34466, 34492 (June 17, 2008).</p><p class="depth0">All of the public comments received by the Department in response to  this question were supportive of the Department's ensuring that the  residential standards apply to housing built on behalf of public  entities with the intent that the finished units would be sold to  individual owners. The vast majority of commenters recommended that the  Department require that projects consisting of five or more units,  whether or not the units are located on one or multiple locations,  comply with the 2004 ADAAG requirements for scoping of residential  units, which require that 5 percent, and no fewer than one, of the  dwelling units provide mobility features, and that 2 percent, and no  fewer   than one, of the dwelling units provide communication features. See 2004  ADAAG Section 233.3. These commenters argued that the Department should  not defer to HUD because HUD has not yet adopted the 2004 ADAAG and  there is ambiguity on the scope of coverage of pre-built for sale units  under HUD's current section 504 regulations. In addition, these  commenters expressed concern that HUD's current regulation, 24 CFR 8.29,  presumes that a prospective buyer is identified before design and  construction begins so that disability features can be incorporated  prior to construction. These commenters stated that State and Federally  funded homeownership programs typically do not identify prospective  buyers before construction has commenced. One commenter stated that, in  its experience, when public entities build accessible for-sale units,  they often sell these units through a lottery system that does not make  any effort to match persons who need the accessible features with the  units that have those features. Thus, accessible units are often sold to  persons without disabilities. This commenter encouraged the Department  to make sure that accessible for-sale units built or funded by public  entities are placed in a separate lottery restricted to income-eligible  persons with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Two commenters recommended that the Department develop rules for  four types of for-sale projects: single family pre-built (where buyer  selects the unit after construction), single family post-built (where  the buyer chooses the model prior to its construction), multi-family  pre-built, and multi-family post-built. These commenters recommended  that the Department require pre-built units to comply with the 2004  ADAAG 233.1 scoping requirements. For post-built units, the commenters  recommended that the Department require all models to have an alternate  design with mobility features and an alternate design with  communications features in compliance with 2004 ADAAG. Accessible models  should be available at no extra cost to the buyer. One commenter  recommended that, in addition to required fully accessible units, all  ground floor units should be readily convertible for accessibility or  for sensory impairments technology enhancements.</p><p class="depth0">The Department believes that consistent with existing requirements  under title II, housing programs operated by public entities that design  and construct or alter residential units for sale to individual owners  should comply with the 2010 Standards, including the requirements for  residential facilities in sections 233 and 809. These requirements will  ensure that a minimum of 5 percent of the units, but no fewer than one  unit, of the total number of residential dwelling units will be designed  and constructed to be accessible for persons with mobility disabilities.  At least 2 percent, but no fewer than one unit, of the total number of  residential dwelling units shall provide communication features.</p><p class="depth0">The Department recognizes that there are some programs (such as the  one identified by the commenter), in which units are not designed and  constructed until an individual buyer is identified. In such cases, the  public entity is still obligated to comply with the 2010 Standards. In  addition, the public entity must ensure that pre-identified buyers with  mobility disabilities and visual and hearing disabilities are afforded  the opportunity to buy the accessible units. Once the program has  identified buyers who need the number of accessible units mandated by  the 2010 Standards, it may have to make reasonable modifications to its  policies, practices, and procedures in order to provide accessible units  to other buyers with disabilities who request such units.</p><p class="depth0">The Department notes that the residential facilities standards allow  for construction of units with certain features of adaptability. Public  entities that are concerned that fully accessible units are less  marketable may choose to build these units to include the allowable  adaptable features, and then adapt them at their own expense for buyers  with mobility disabilities who need accessible units. For example,  features such as grab bars are not required but may be added by the  public entity if needed by the buyer at the time of purchase and  cabinets under sinks may be designed to be removable to allow access to  the required knee space for a forward approach.</p><p class="depth0">The Department agrees with the commenters that covered entities may  have to make reasonable modifications to their policies, practices, and  procedures in order to ensure that when they offer pre-built accessible  residential units for sale, the units are offered in a manner that gives  access to those units to persons with disabilities who need the features  of the units and who are otherwise eligible for the housing program.  This may be accomplished, for example, by adopting preferences for  accessible units for persons who need the features of the units, holding  separate lotteries for accessible units, or other suitable methods that  result in the sale of accessible units to persons who need the features  of such units. In addition, the Department believes that units designed  and constructed or altered that comply with the requirements for  residential facilities and are offered for sale to individuals must be  provided at the same price as units without such features.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(k) Detention and correctional facilities</p><p class="depth0">The 1991 Standards did not contain specific accessibility standards  applicable to cells in correctional facilities. However, correctional   and detention facilities operated by or on behalf of public entities  have always been subject to the nondiscrimination and program  accessibility requirements of title II of the ADA. The 2004 ADAAG  established specific requirements for the design and construction and  alterations of cells in correctional facilities for the first time.</p><p class="depth0">Based on complaints received by the Department, investigations, and  compliance reviews of jails, prisons, and other detention and  correctional facilities, the Department has determined that many  detention and correctional facilities do not have enough accessible  cells, toilets, and shower facilities to meet the needs of their inmates  with mobility disabilities and some do not have any at all. Inmates are  sometimes housed in medical units or infirmaries separate from the  general population simply because there are no accessible cells. In  addition, some inmates have alleged that they are housed at a more  restrictive classification level simply because no accessible housing  exists at the appropriate classification level. The Department's  compliance reviews and investigations have substantiated certain of  these allegations.</p><p class="depth0">The Department believes that the insufficient number of accessible  cells is, in part, due to the fact that most jails and prisons were  built long before the ADA became law and, since then, have undergone few  alterations that would trigger the obligation to provide accessible  features in accordance with UFAS or the 1991 Standards. In addition, the  Department has found that even some new correctional facilities lack  accessible features. The Department believes that the unmet demand for  accessible cells is also due to the changing demographics of the inmate  population. With thousands of prisoners serving life sentences without  eligibility for parole, prisoners are aging, and the prison population  of individuals with disabilities and elderly individuals is growing. A  Bureau of Justice Statistics study of State and Federal sentenced  inmates (those sentenced to more than one year) shows the total  estimated count of State and Federal prisoners aged 55 and older grew by  36,000 inmates from 2000 (44,200) to 2006 (80,200). William J. Sabol et  al., Prisoners in 2006, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Dec.  2007, at 23 (app. table 7), available at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/ index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid;=908 (last visited July 16, 2008); Allen J.  Beck et al., Prisoners in 2000, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin,  Aug. 2001, at 10 (Aug. 2001) (Table 14), available at bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/ index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid;=927 (last visited July 16, 2008). This jump  constitutes an increase of 81 percent in prisoners aged 55 and older  during this period.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed a new section, Sec.  35.152,  which combined a range of provisions relating to both program  accessibility and application of the proposed standards to detention and  correctional facilities. In the final rule, the Department is placing  those provisions that refer to design, construction, and alteration of  detention and correction facilities in a new paragraph (k) of Sec.   35.151, the section of the rule that addresses new construction and  alterations for covered entities. Those portions of the final rule that  address other issues, such as placement policies and program  accessibility, are placed in the new Sec.  35.152.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department also sought input on how best to meet  the needs of inmates with mobility disabilities in the design,  construction, and alteration of detention and correctional facilities.  The Department received a number of comments in response to this  question.</p><p class="depth0">New Construction. The NPRM did not expressly propose that new  construction of correctional and detention facilities shall comply with  the proposed standards because the Department assumed it would be clear  that the requirements of Sec.  35.151 would apply to new construction of  correctional and detention facilities in the same manner that they apply  to other facilities constructed by covered entities. The Department has  decided to create a new section, Sec.  35.151(k)(1), which clarifies  that new construction of jails, prisons, and other detention facilities  shall comply with the requirements of 2010 Standards. Section  35.151(k)(1) also increases the scoping for accessible cells from the 2  percent specified in the 2004 ADAAG to 3 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Alterations. Although the 2010 Standards contain specifications for  alterations in existing detention and correctional facilities, section  232.2 defers to the Attorney General the decision as to the extent these  requirements will apply to alterations of cells. The NPRM proposed at  Sec.  35.152(c) that ``[a]lterations to jails, prisons, and other  detention and correctional facilities will comply with the requirements  of Sec.  35.151(b).'' 73 FR 34466, 34507 (June 17, 2008). The final rule  retains that requirement at Sec.  35.151(k)(2), but increases the  scoping for accessible cells from the 2 percent specified in the 2004  ADAAG to 3 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Substitute cells. In the ANPRM, the Department sought public comment  about the most effective means to ensure that existing correctional  facilities are made accessible to prisoners with disabilities and  presented three options: (1) Require all altered elements to be  accessible, which would maintain the current policy that applies to  other ADA alteration requirements; (2) permit substitute cells to be  made accessible within the same facility, which would permit  correctional authorities to meet their obligation by providing the  required accessible features in cells within the same facility, other  than those specific cells in which alterations are   planned; or (3) permit substitute cells to be made accessible within a  prison system, which would focus on ensuring that prisoners with  disabilities are housed in facilities that best meet their needs, as  alterations within a prison environment often result in piecemeal  accessibility.</p><p class="depth0">In Sec.  35.152(c) of the NPRM, the Department proposed language  based on Option 2, providing that when cells are altered, a covered  entity may satisfy its obligation to provide the required number of  cells with mobility features by providing the required mobility features  in substitute cells (i.e., cells other than those where alterations are  originally planned), provided that each substitute cell is located  within the same facility, is integrated with other cells to the maximum  extent feasible, and has, at a minimum, physical access equal to that of  the original cells to areas used by inmates or detainees for visitation,  dining, recreation, educational programs, medical services, work  programs, religious services, and participation in other programs that  the facility offers to inmates or detainees.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received few comments on this proposal. The majority  who chose to comment supported an approach that allowed substitute cells  to be made accessible within the same facility. In their view, such an  approach balanced administrators' needs, cost considerations, and the  needs of inmates with disabilities. One commenter noted, however, that  with older facilities, required modifications may be inordinately costly  and technically infeasible. A large county jail system supported the  proposed approach as the most viable option allowing modification or  alteration of existing cells based on need and providing a flexible  approach to provide program and mobility accessibility. It noted, as an  alternative, that permitting substitute cells to be made accessible  within a prison system would also be a viable option since such an  approach could create a centralized location for accessibility needs  and, because that jail system's facilities were in close proximity, it  would have little impact on families for visitation or on accessible  programming.</p><p class="depth0">A large State department of corrections objected to the Department's  proposal. The commenter stated that some very old prison buildings have  thick walls of concrete and reinforced steel that are difficult, if not  impossible to retrofit, and to do so would be very expensive. This State  system approaches accessibility by looking at its system as a whole and  providing access to programs for inmates with disabilities at selected  prisons. This commenter explained that not all of its facilities offer  the same programs or the same levels of medical or mental health  services. An inmate, for example, who needs education, substance abuse  treatment, and sex offender counseling may be transferred between  facilities in order to meet his needs. The inmate population is always  in flux and there are not always beds or program availability for every  inmate at his security level. This commenter stated that the  Department's proposed language would put the State in the position of  choosing between adding accessible cells and modifying paths of travel  to programs and services at great expense or not altering old  facilities, causing them to become in states of disrepair and  obsolescent, which would be fiscally irresponsible.</p><p class="depth0">The Department is persuaded by these comments and has modified the  alterations requirement in Sec.  35.151(k)(2)(iv) in the final rule to  allow that if it is technically infeasible to provide substitute cells  in the same facility, cells can be provided elsewhere within the  corrections system.</p><p class="depth0">Number of accessible cells. Section 232.2.1 of the 2004 ADAAG  requires at least 2 percent, but no fewer than one, of the cells in  newly constructed detention and correctional facilities to have  accessibility features for individuals with mobility disabilities.  Section 232.3 provides that, where special holding cells or special  housing cells are provided, at least one cell serving each purpose shall  have mobility features. The Department sought input on whether these  2004 ADAAG requirements are sufficient to meet the needs of inmates with  mobility disabilities. A major association representing county jails  throughout the country stated that the 2004 ADAAG 2 percent requirement  for accessible cells is sufficient to meet the needs of county jails.  Similarly, a large county sheriff's department advised that the 2  percent requirement far exceeds the need at its detention facility,  where the average age of the population is 32. This commenter stressed  that the regulations need to address the differences between a local  detention facility with low average lengths of stay as opposed to a  State prison housing inmates for lengthy periods. This commenter  asserted that more stringent requirements will raise construction costs  by requiring modifications that are not needed. If more stringent  requirements are adopted, the commenter suggested that they apply only  to State and Federal prisons that house prisoners sentenced to long  terms. The Department notes that a prisoner with a mobility disability  needs a cell with mobility features regardless of the length of  incarceration. However, the length of incarceration is most relevant in  addressing the needs of an aging population.</p><p class="depth0">The overwhelming majority of commenters responded that the 2 percent  ADAAG requirement is inadequate to meet the needs of the incarcerated.  Many commenters suggested that the requirement be expanded to apply to  each area, type, use, and class of   cells in a facility. They asserted that if a facility has separate areas  for specific programs, such as a dog training program or a substance  abuse unit, each of these areas should also have 2 percent accessible  cells but not less than one. These same commenters suggested that 5-7  percent of cells should be accessible to meet the needs of both an aging  population and the larger number of inmates with mobility disabilities.  One organization recommended that the requirement be increased to 5  percent overall, and that at least 2 percent of each type and use of  cell be accessible. Another commenter recommended that 10 percent of  cells be accessible. An organization with extensive corrections  experience noted that the integration mandate requires a sufficient  number and distribution of accessible cells so as to provide  distribution of locations relevant to programs to ensure that persons  with disabilities have access to the programs.</p><p class="depth0">Through its investigations and compliance reviews, the Department  has found that in most detention and correctional facilities, a 2  percent accessible cell requirement is inadequate to meet the needs of  the inmate population with disabilities. That finding is supported by  the majority of the commenters that recommended a 5-7 percent  requirement. Indeed, the Department itself requires more than 2 percent  of the cells to be accessible at its own corrections facilities. The  Federal Bureau of Prisons is subject to the requirements of the 2004  ADAAG through the General Services Administration's adoption of the 2004  ADAAG as the enforceable accessibility standard for Federal facilities  under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. 70 FR 67786, 67846-47  (Nov. 8, 2005). However, in order to meet the needs of inmates with  mobility disabilities, the Bureau of Prisons has elected to increase  that percentage and require that 3 percent of inmate housing at its  facilities be accessible. Bureau of Prisons, Design Construction Branch,  Design Guidelines, Attachment A: Accessibility Guidelines for Design,  Construction, and Alteration of Federal Bureau of Prisons (Oct. 31,  2006).</p><p class="depth0">The Department believes that a 3 percent accessible requirement is  reasonable. Moreover, it does not believe it should impose a higher  percentage on detention and corrections facilities than it utilizes for  its own facilities. Thus, the Department has adopted a 3 percent  requirement in Sec.  35.151(k) for both new construction and  alterations. The Department notes that the 3 percent requirement is a  minimum. As corrections systems plan for new facilities or alterations,  the Department urges planners to include numbers of inmates with  disabilities in their population projections in order to take the  necessary steps to provide a sufficient number of accessible cells to  meet inmate needs.</p><p class="depth0">Dispersion of Cells. The NPRM did not contain express language  addressing dispersion of cells in a facility. However, Advisory 232.2 of  the 2004 ADAAG recommends that ``[a]ccessible cells or rooms should be  dispersed among different levels of security, housing categories, and  holding classifications (e.g., male/female and adult/juvenile) to  facilitate access.'' In explaining the basis for recommending, but not  requiring, this type of dispersal, the Access Board stated that ``[m]any  detention and correctional facilities are designed so that certain areas  (e.g., `shift' areas) can be adapted to serve as different types of  housing according to need'' and that ``[p]lacement of accessible cells  or rooms in shift areas may allow additional flexibility in meeting  requirements for dispersion of accessible cells or rooms.''</p><p class="depth0">The Department notes that inmates are typically housed in separate  areas of detention and correctional facilities based on a number of  factors, including their classification level. In many instances,  detention and correctional facilities have housed inmates in  inaccessible cells, even though accessible cells were available  elsewhere in the facility, because there were no cells in the areas  where they needed to be housed, such as in administrative or  disciplinary segregation, the women's section of the facility, or in a  particular security classification area.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received a number of comments stating that dispersal  of accessible cells together with an adequate number of accessible cells  is necessary to prevent inmates with disabilities from placement in  improper security classification and to ensure integration. Commenters  recommended modification of the scoping requirements to require a  percentage of accessible cells in each program, classification, use or  service area. The Department is persuaded by these comments.  Accordingly, Sec.  35.151(k)(1) and (k)(2) of the final rule require  accessible cells in each classification area.</p><p class="depth0">Medical facilities. The NPRM also did not propose language  addressing the application of the 2004 ADAAG to medical and long-term  care facilities in correctional and detention facilities. The provisions  of the 2004 ADAAG contain requirements for licensed medical and long- term care facilities, but not those that are unlicensed. A disability  advocacy group and a number of other commenters recommended that the  Department expand the application of section 232.4 to apply to all such  facilities in detention and correctional facilities, regardless of  licensure. They recommended that whenever a correctional facility has a  program that is addressed specifically in the 2004 ADAAG, such as a  long-term care facility, the 2004 ADAAG scoping and design features  should apply for those elements. Similarly, a building code organization  noted that its percentage requirements for accessible units is based on   what occurs in the space, not on the building type.</p><p class="depth0">The Department is persuaded by these comments and has added Sec.   35.151(k)(3), which states that ``[w]ith respect to medical and long- term care facilities in jails, prisons, and other detention and  correctional facilities, public entities shall apply the 2010 Standards  technical and scoping requirements for those facilities irrespective of  whether those facilities are licensed.''</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.152 Detention and correctional facilities--program</p><p class="depth0">requirements</p><p class="depth0">As noted in the discussion of Sec.  35.151(k), the Department has  determined that inmates with mobility and other disabilities in  detention and correctional facilities do not have equal access to prison  services. The Department's concerns are based not only on complaints it  has received, but the Department's substantial experience in  investigations and compliance reviews of jails, prisons, and other  detention and correctional facilities. Based on that review, the  Department has found that many detention and correctional facilities  have too few or no accessible cells, toilets, and shower facilities to  meet the needs of their inmates with mobility disabilities. These  findings, coupled with statistics regarding the current percentage of  inmates with mobility disabilities and the changing demographics of the  inmate population reflecting thousands of prisoners serving life  sentences and increasingly large numbers of aging inmates who are not  eligible for parole, led the Department to conclude that a new  regulation was necessary to address these concerns.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed a new section, Sec.  35.152,  which combined a range of provisions relating to both program  accessibility and application of the proposed standards to detention and  correctional facilities. As mentioned above, in the final rule, the  Department is placing those provisions that refer to design,  construction, and alteration of detention and correction facilities in  new paragraph (k) in Sec.  35.151 dealing with new construction and  alterations for covered entities. Those portions of the final rule that  address other program requirements remain in Sec.  35.152.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received many comments in response to the program  accessibility requirements in proposed Sec.  35.152. These comments are  addressed below.</p><p class="depth0">Facilities operated through contractual, licensing, or other  arrangements with other public entities or private entities. The  Department is aware that some public entities are confused about the  applicability of the title II requirements to correctional facilities  built or run by other public entities or private entities. It has  consistently been the Department's position that title II requirements  apply to correctional facilities used by State or local government  entities, irrespective of whether the public entity contracts with  another public or private entity to build or run the correctional  facility. The power to incarcerate citizens rests with the State or  local government, not a private entity. As the Department stated in the  preamble to the original title II regulation, ``[a]ll governmental  activities of public entities are covered, even if they are carried out  by contractors.'' 28 CFR part 35, app. A at 558 (2009). If a prison is  occupied by State prisoners and is inaccessible, the State is  responsible under title II of the ADA. The same is true for a county or  city jail. In essence, the private builder or contractor that operates  the correctional facility does so at the direction of the government  entity. Moreover, even if the State enters into a contractual,  licensing, or other arrangement for correctional services with a public  entity that has its own title II obligations, the State is still  responsible for ensuring that the other public entity complies with  title II in providing these services.</p><p class="depth0">Also, through its experience in investigations and compliance  reviews, the Department has noted that public entities contract for a  number of services to be run by private or other public entities, for  example, medical and mental health services, food services, laundry,  prison industries, vocational programs, and drug treatment and substance  abuse programs, all of which must be operated in accordance with title  II requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Proposed Sec.  35.152(a) in the NPRM was designed to make it clear  that title II applies to all State and local detention and correctional  facilities, regardless of whether the detention or correctional facility  is directly operated by the public entity or operated by a private  entity through a contractual, licensing, or other arrangement.  Commenters specifically supported the language of this section. One  commenter cited Department of Justice statistics stating that of the  approximately 1.6 million inmates in State and Federal facilities in  December 2006, approximately 114,000 of these inmates were held in  private prison facilities. See William J. Sabol et al., Prisoners in  2006, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Dec. 2007, at 1, 4,  available at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid;=908.  Some commenters wanted the text ``through contracts or other  arrangements'' changed to read ``through contracts or any other  arrangements'' to make the intent clear. However, a large number of  commenters recommended that the text of the rule make explicit that it  applies to correctional facilities operated by private contractors. Many  commenters also suggested that the text make clear that the rule applies  to adult facilities, juvenile   justice facilities, and community correctional facilities. In the final  rule, the Department is adopting these latter two suggestions in order  to make the section's intent explicit.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.152(a) of the final rule states specifically that the  requirements of the section apply to public entities responsible for the  operation or management of correctional facilities, ``either directly or  through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements with public or  private entities, in whole or in part, including private correctional  facilities.'' Additionally, the section explicitly provides that it  applies to adult and juvenile justice detention and correctional  facilities and community correctional facilities.</p><p class="depth0">Discrimination prohibited. In the NPRM, Sec.  35.152(b)(1) proposed  language stating that public entities are prohibited from excluding  qualified detainees and inmates from participation in, or denying,  benefits, services, programs, or activities because a facility is  inaccessible to persons with disabilities ``unless the public entity can  demonstrate that the required actions would result in a fundamental  alteration or undue burden.'' 73 FR 34446, 34507 (June 17, 2008). One  large State department of corrections objected to the entire section  applicable to detention and correctional facilities, stating that it  sets a higher standard for correctional and detention facilities because  it does not provide a defense for undue administrative burden. The  Department has not retained the proposed NPRM language referring to the  defenses of fundamental alteration or undue burden because the  Department believes that these exceptions are covered by the general  language of 35.150(a)(3), which states that a public entity is not  required to take ``any action that it can demonstrate would result in a  fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity,  or in undue financial and administrative burdens.'' The Department has  revised the language of Sec.  35.152(b)(1) accordingly.</p><p class="depth0">Integration of inmates and detainees with disabilities. In the NPRM,  the Department proposed language in Sec.  35.152(b)(2) specifically  applying the ADA's general integration mandate to detention and  correctional facilities. The proposed language would have required  public entities to ensure that individuals with disabilities are housed  in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the  individual. It further stated that unless the public entity can  demonstrate that it is appropriate to make an exception for a specific  individual, a public entity:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Should not place inmates or detainees with disabilities in  locations that exceed their security classification because there are no  accessible cells or beds in the appropriate classification;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> should not place inmates or detainees with disabilities in  designated medical areas unless they are actually receiving medical care  or treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> should not place inmates or detainees with disabilities in  facilities that do not offer the same programs as the facilities where  they would ordinarily be housed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> should not place inmates or detainees with disabilities in  facilities farther away from their families in order to provide  accessible cells or beds, thus diminishing their opportunity for  visitation based on their disability. 73 FR 34466, 34507 (June 17,  2008).</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department recognized that there are a wide range  of considerations that affect decisions to house inmates or detainees  and that in specific cases there may be compelling reasons why a  placement that does not meet the general requirements of Sec.   35.152(b)(2) may, nevertheless, comply with the ADA. However, the  Department noted that it is essential that the planning process  initially assume that inmates or detainees with disabilities will be  assigned within the system under the same criteria that would be applied  to inmates who do not have disabilities. Exceptions may be made on a  case-by-case basis if the specific situation warrants different  treatment. For example, if an inmate is deaf and communicates only using  sign language, a prison may consider whether it is more appropriate to  give priority to housing the prisoner in a facility close to his family  that houses no other deaf inmates, or if it would be preferable to house  the prisoner in a setting where there are sign language interpreters and  other sign language users with whom he can communicate.</p><p class="depth0">In general, commenters strongly supported the NPRM's clarification  that the title II integration mandate applies to State and local  corrections agencies and the facilities in which they house inmates.  Commenters pointed out that inmates with disabilities continue to be  segregated based on their disabilities and also excluded from  participation in programs. An organization actively involved in  addressing the needs of prisoners cited a number of recent lawsuits in  which prisoners allege such discrimination.</p><p class="depth0">The majority of commenters objected to the language in proposed  Sec.  35.152(b)(2) that creates an exception to the integration mandate  when the ``public entity can demonstrate that it is appropriate to make  an exception for a specific individual.'' 73 FR 34466, 34507 (June 17,  2008). The vast majority of commenters asserted that, given the practice  of many public entities to segregate and cluster inmates with  disabilities, the exception will be used to justify the status quo. The  commenters acknowledged that the intent of the section is to ensure that  an individual with a disability who can be better served in a less  integrated setting can legally be placed in that setting. They were  concerned, however, that the proposed language would allow certain  objectionable   practices to continue, e.g., automatically placing persons with  disabilities in administrative segregation. An advocacy organization  with extensive experience working with inmates recommended that the  inmate have ``input'' in the placement decision.</p><p class="depth0">Others commented that the exception does not provide sufficient  guidance on when a government entity may make an exception, citing the  need for objective standards. Some commenters posited that a prison  administration may want to house a deaf inmate at a facility designated  and equipped for deaf inmates that is several hundred miles from the  inmate's home. Although under the exception language, such a placement  may be appropriate, these commenters argued that this outcome appears to  contradict the regulation's intent to eliminate or reduce the  segregation of inmates with disabilities and prevent them from being  placed far from their families. The Department notes that in some  jurisdictions, the likelihood of such outcomes is diminished because  corrections facilities with different programs and levels of  accessibility are clustered in close proximity to one another, so that  being far from family is not an issue. The Department also takes note of  advancements in technology that will ease the visitation dilemma, such  as family visitation through the use of videoconferencing.</p><p class="depth0">Only one commenter, a large State department of corrections,  objected to the integration requirement. This commenter stated it houses  all maximum security inmates in maximum security facilities. Inmates  with lower security levels may or may not be housed in lower security  facilities depending on a number of factors, such as availability of a  bed, staffing, program availability, medical and mental health needs,  and enemy separation. The commenter also objected to the proposal to  prohibit housing inmates with disabilities in medical areas unless they  are receiving medical care. This commenter stated that such housing may  be necessary for several days, for example, at a stopover facility for  an inmate with a disability who is being transferred from one facility  to another. Also, this commenter stated that inmates with disabilities  in disciplinary status may be housed in the infirmary because not every  facility has accessible cells in disciplinary housing. Similarly the  commenter objected to the prohibition on placing inmates in facilities  without the same programs as facilities where they normally would be  housed. Finally, the commenter objected to the prohibition on placing an  inmate at a facility distant from where the inmate would normally be  housed. The commenter stressed that in its system, there are few  facilities near most inmates' homes. The commenter noted that most  inmates are housed at facilities far from their homes, a fact shared by  all inmates, not just inmates with disabilities. Another commenter noted  that in some jurisdictions, inmates who need assistance in activities of  daily living cannot obtain that assistance in the general population,  but only in medical facilities where they must be housed.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has considered the concerns raised by the commenters  with respect to this section and recognizes that corrections systems may  move inmates routinely and for a variety of reasons, such as crowding,  safety, security, classification change, need for specialized programs,  or to provide medical care. Sometimes these moves are within the same  facility or prison system. On other occasions, inmates may be  transferred to facilities in other cities, counties, and States. Given  the nature of the prison environment, inmates have little say in their  placement and administrators must have flexibility to meet the needs of  the inmates and the system. The Department has revised the language of  the exception contained in renumbered Sec.  35.152(b)(2) to better  accommodate corrections administrators' need for flexibility in making  placement decisions based on legitimate, specific reasons. Moreover, the  Department believes that temporary, short-term moves that are necessary  for security or administrative purposes (e.g., placing an inmate with a  disability in a medical area at a stopover facility during a transfer  from one facility to another) do not violate the requirements of Sec.   35.152(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">The Department notes that Sec.  35.150(a)(3) states that a public  entity is not required to take ``any action that it can demonstrate  would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service,  program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens.''  Thus, corrections systems would not have to comply with the requirements  of Sec.  35.152(b)(1) in any specific circumstance where these defenses  are met.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters recommended that the word ``should'' be changed  to ``shall'' in the subparts to Sec.  35.152(b)(2). The Department  agrees that because the rule contains a specific exception and because  the integration requirement is subject to the defenses provided in  paragraph (a) of that section, it is more appropriate to use the word  ``shall'' and the Department accordingly is making that change in the  final rule.</p><p class="depth0">Program requirements. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court, in  Pennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206 (1998),  stated explicitly that the ADA covers the operations of State prisons;  accordingly, title II's program accessibility requirements apply to  State and local correctional and detention facilities. In the NPRM, in  addressing the accessibility of existing correctional and detention  facilities, the Department considered the challenges of applying the  title II program access requirement for existing facilities under Sec.   31.150(a) in light of   the realities of many inaccessible correctional facilities and strained  budgets.</p><p class="depth0">Correctional and detention facilities commonly provide a variety of  different programs for education, training, counseling, or other  purposes related to rehabilitation. Some examples of programs generally  available to inmates include programs to obtain GEDs, computer training,  job skill training and on-the-job training, religious instruction and  guidance, alcohol and substance abuse groups, anger management, work  assignments, work release, halfway houses, and other programs.  Historically, individuals with disabilities have been excluded from such  programs because they are not located in accessible locations, or  inmates with disabilities have been segregated in units without  equivalent programs. In light of the Supreme Court's decision in Yeskey  and the requirements of title II, however, it is critical that public  entities provide these opportunities to inmates with disabilities. In  proposed Sec.  35.152, the Department sought to clarify that title II  required equal access for inmates with disabilities to participate in  programs offered to inmates without disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">The Department wishes to emphasize that detention and correctional  facilities are unique facilities under title II. Inmates cannot leave  the facilities and must have their needs met by the corrections system,  including needs relating to a disability. If the detention and  correctional facilities fail to accommodate prisoners with disabilities,  these individuals have little recourse, particularly when the need is  great (e.g., an accessible toilet; adequate catheters; or a shower  chair). It is essential that corrections systems fulfill their  nondiscrimination and program access obligations by adequately  addressing the needs of prisoners with disabilities, which include, but  are not limited to, proper medication and medical treatment, accessible  toilet and shower facilities, devices such as a bed transfer or a shower  chair, and assistance with hygiene methods for prisoners with physical  disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department also sought input on whether it should  establish a program accessibility requirement that public entities  modify additional cells at a detention or correctional facility to  incorporate the accessibility features needed by specific inmates with  mobility disabilities when the number of cells required by sections  232.2 and 232.3 of the 2004 ADAAG are inadequate to meet the needs of  their inmate population.</p><p class="depth0">Commenters supported a program accessibility requirement, viewing it  as a flexible and practical means of allowing facilities to meet the  needs of inmates in a cost effective and expedient manner. One  organization supported a requirement to modify additional cells when the  existing number of accessible cells is inadequate. It cited the example  of a detainee who was held in a hospital because the local jail had no  accessible cells. Similarly, a State agency recommended that the number  of accessible cells should be sufficient to accommodate the population  in need. One group of commenters voiced concern about accessibility  being provided in a timely manner and recommended that the rule specify  that the program accessibility requirement applies while waiting for the  accessibility modifications. A group with experience addressing inmate  needs recommended the inmate's input should be required to prevent  inappropriate segregation or placement in an inaccessible or  inappropriate area.</p><p class="depth0">The Department is persuaded by these comments. Accordingly, Sec.   35.152(b)(3) requires public entities to ``implement reasonable  policies, including physical modifications to additional cells in  accordance with the 2010 Standards, so as to ensure that each inmate  with a disability is housed in a cell with the accessible elements  necessary to afford the inmate access to safe, appropriate housing.''</p><p class="depth0">Communication. Several large disability advocacy organizations  commented on the 2004 ADAAG section 232.2.2 requirement that at least 2  percent of the general holding cells and housing cells must be equipped  with audible emergency alarm systems. Permanently installed telephones  within these cells must have volume control. Commenters said that the  communication features in the 2004 ADAAG do not address the most common  barriers that deaf and hard-of-hearing inmates face. They asserted that  few cells have telephones and the requirements to make them accessible  is limited to volume control, and that emergency alarm systems are only  a small part of the amplified information that inmates need. One large  association commented that it receives many inmate complaints that  announcements are made over loudspeakers or public address systems, and  that inmates who do not hear announcements for inmate count or other  instructions face disciplinary action for failure to comply. They  asserted that inmates who miss announcements miss meals, exercise,  showers, and recreation. They argued that systems that deliver audible  announcements, signals, and emergency alarms must be made accessible and  that TTYs must be made available. Commenters also recommended that  correctional facilities should provide access to advanced forms of  telecommunications. Additional commenters noted that few persons now use  TTYs, preferring instead to communicate by email, texting, and  videophones.</p><p class="depth0">The Department agrees with the commenters that correctional  facilities and jails must ensure that inmates who are deaf or hard of  hearing actually receive the same information provided to other inmates.  The   Department believes, however, that the reasonable modifications, program  access, and effective communications requirements of title II are  sufficient to address the needs of individual deaf and hard of hearing  inmates, and as a result, declines to add specific requirements for  communications features in cells for deaf and hard of hearing inmates at  this time. The Department notes that as part of its ongoing enforcement  of the reasonable modifications, program access, and effective  communications requirements of title II, the Department has required  correctional facilities and jails to provide communication features in  cells serving deaf and hard of hearing inmates.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart E--Communications</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.160 Communications.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.160 of the 1991 title II regulation requires a public  entity to take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with  applicants, participants, and members of the public with disabilities  are as effective as communications with others. 28 CFR 35.160(a). In  addition, a public entity must ``furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and  services where necessary to afford an individual with a disability an  equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a  service, program, or activity conducted by a public entity.'' 28 CFR  35.160(b)(1). Moreover, the public entity must give ``primary  consideration to the requests of the individual with disabilities'' in  determining what type of auxiliary aid and service is necessary. 28 CFR  35.160(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Since promulgation of the 1991 title II regulation, the Department  has investigated hundreds of complaints alleging failures by public  entities to provide effective communication, and many of these  investigations resulted in settlement agreements and consent decrees.  From these investigations, the Department has concluded that public  entities sometimes misunderstand the scope of their obligations under  the statute and the regulation. Section 35.160 in the final rule  codifies the Department's longstanding policies in this area and  includes provisions that reflect technological advances in the area of  auxiliary aids and services.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed adding ``companion'' to the  scope of coverage under Sec.  35.160 to codify the Department's  longstanding position that a public entity's obligation to ensure  effective communication extends not just to applicants, participants,  and members of the public with disabilities, but to companions as well,  if any of them are individuals with disabilities. The NPRM defined  companion as a person who is a family member, friend, or associate of a  program participant, who, along with the program participant, is ``an  appropriate person with whom the public entity should communicate.'' 73  FR 34466, 34507 (June 17, 2008).</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters supported inclusion of ``companions'' in the rule,  and urged even more specific language about public entities'  obligations. Some commenters asked the Department to clarify that a  companion with a disability may be entitled to effective communication  from a public entity even though the applicants, participants, or  members of the general public seeking access to, or participating in,  the public entity's services, programs, or activities are not  individuals with disabilities. Others requested that the Department  explain the circumstances under which auxiliary aids and services should  be provided to companions. Still others requested explicit clarification  that where the individual seeking access to or participating in the  public entity's program, services, or activities requires auxiliary aids  and services, but the companion does not, the public entity may not seek  out, or limit its communications to, the companion instead of  communicating directly with the individual with a disability when it  would be appropriate to do so.</p><p class="depth0">Some in the medical community objected to the inclusion of any  regulatory language regarding companions, asserting that such language  is overbroad, seeks services for individuals whose presence is not  required by the public entity, is not necessary for the delivery of the  services or participation in the program, and places additional burdens  on the medical community. These commenters asked that the Department  limit the public entity's obligation to communicate effectively with a  companion to situations where such communications are necessary to serve  the interests of the person who is receiving the public entity's  services.</p><p class="depth0">After consideration of the many comments on this issue, the  Department believes that explicit inclusion of ``companions'' in the  final rule is appropriate to ensure that public entities understand the  scope of their effective communication obligations. There are many  situations in which the interests of program participants without  disabilities require that their companions with disabilities be provided  effective communication. In addition, the program participant need not  be physically present to trigger the public entity's obligations to a  companion. The controlling principle is that auxiliary aids and services  must be provided if the companion is an appropriate person with whom the  public entity should or would communicate.</p><p class="depth0">Examples of such situations include back-to-school nights or parent- teacher conferences at a public school. If the faculty writes on the  board or otherwise displays information in a visual context during a  back-to-school night, this information must be communicated effectively  to parents or guardians who are blind or have low vision.   At a parent-teacher conference, deaf parents or guardians must be  provided with appropriate auxiliary aids and services to communicate  effectively with the teacher and administrators. It makes no difference  that the child who attends the school does not have a disability.  Likewise, when a deaf spouse attempts to communicate with public social  service agencies about the services necessary for the hearing spouse,  appropriate auxiliary aids and services to the deaf spouse must be  provided by the public entity to ensure effective communication. Parents  or guardians, including foster parents, who are individuals with  disabilities, may need to interact with child services agencies on  behalf of their children; in such a circumstance, the child services  agencies would need to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services  to those parents or guardians.</p><p class="depth0">Effective communication with companions is particularly critical in  health care settings where miscommunication may lead to misdiagnosis and  improper or delayed medical treatment. The Department has encountered  confusion and reluctance by medical care providers regarding the scope  of their obligation with respect to such companions. Effective  communication with a companion is necessary in a variety of  circumstances. For example, a companion may be legally authorized to  make health care decisions on behalf of the patient or may need to help  the patient with information or instructions given by hospital  personnel. A companion may be the patient's next-of-kin or health care  surrogate with whom hospital personnel must communicate about the  patient's medical condition. A companion could be designated by the  patient to communicate with hospital personnel about the patient's  symptoms, needs, condition, or medical history. Or the companion could  be a family member with whom hospital personnel normally would  communicate.</p><p class="depth0">Accordingly, Sec.  35.160(a)(1) in the final rule now reads, ``[a]  public entity shall take appropriate steps to ensure that communications  with applicants, participants, members of the public, and companions  with disabilities are as effective as communications with others.''  Section 35.160(a)(2) further defines ``companion'' as ``a family member,  friend, or associate of an individual seeking access to a service,  program, or activity of a public entity, who, along with the individual,  is an appropriate person with whom the public entity should  communicate.'' Section 35.160(b)(1) clarifies that the obligation to  furnish auxiliary aids and services extends to companions who are  individuals with disabilities, whether or not the individual accompanied  also is an individual with a disability. The provision now states that  ``[a] public entity shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and  services where necessary to afford individuals with disabilities,  including applicants, participants, companions, and members of the  public, an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits  of, a service, program, or activity of a public entity.''</p><p class="depth0">These provisions make clear that if the companion is someone with  whom the public entity normally would or should communicate, then the  public entity must provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services to  that companion to ensure effective communication with the companion.  This common-sense rule provides the guidance necessary to enable public  entities to properly implement the nondiscrimination requirements of the  ADA.</p><p class="depth0">As set out in the final rule, Sec.  35.160(b)(2) states, in  pertinent part, that ``[t]he type of auxiliary aid or service necessary  to ensure effective communication will vary in accordance with the  method of communication used by the individual, the nature, length, and  complexity of the communication involved, and the context in which the  communication is taking place. In determining what types of auxiliary  aids and services are necessary, a public entity shall give primary  consideration to the requests of individuals with disabilities.''</p><p class="depth0">The second sentence of Sec.  35.160(b)(2) of the final rule restores  the ``primary consideration'' obligation set out at Sec.  35.160(b)(2)  in the 1991 title II regulation. This provision was inadvertently  omitted from the NPRM, and the Department agrees with the many  commenters on this issue that this provision should be retained. As  noted in the preamble to the 1991 title II regulation, and reaffirmed  here: ``The public entity shall honor the choice [of the individual with  a disability] unless it can demonstrate that another effective means of  communication exists or that use of the means chosen would not be  required under Sec.  35.164. Deference to the request of the individual  with a disability is desirable because of the range of disabilities, the  variety of auxiliary aids and services, and different circumstances  requiring effective communication.'' 28 CFR part 35, app. A at 580  (2009).</p><p class="depth0">The first sentence in Sec.  35.160(b)(2) codifies the axiom that the  type of auxiliary aid or service necessary to ensure effective  communication will vary with the situation, and provides factors for  consideration in making the determination, including the method of  communication used by the individual; the nature, length, and complexity  of the communication involved; and the context in which the  communication is taking place. Inclusion of this language under title II  is consistent with longstanding policy in this area. See, e.g., The  Americans with Disabilities Act Title II Technical Assistance Manual  Covering State and Local Government Programs and Services, section II- 7.1000, available at   www.ada.gov/taman2.html (``The type of auxiliary aid or service  necessary to ensure effective communication will vary in accordance with  the length and complexity of the communication involved. * * * Sign  language or oral interpreters, for example, may be required when the  information being communicated in a transaction with a deaf individual  is complex, or is exchanged for a lengthy period of time. Factors to be  considered in determining whether an interpreter is required include the  context in which the communication is taking place, the number of people  involved, and the importance of the communication.''); see also 28 CFR  part 35, app. A at 580 (2009). As explained in the NPRM, an individual  who is deaf or hard of hearing may need a qualified interpreter to  communicate with municipal hospital personnel about diagnoses,  procedures, tests, treatment options, surgery, or prescribed medication  (e.g., dosage, side effects, drug interactions, etc.), or to explain  follow-up treatments, therapies, test results, or recovery. In  comparison, in a simpler, shorter interaction, the method to achieve  effective communication can be more basic. An individual who is seeking  local tax forms may only need an exchange of written notes to achieve  effective communication.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.160(c)(1) has been added to the final rule to make clear  that a public entity shall not require an individual with a disability  to bring another individual to interpret for him or her. The Department  receives many complaints from individuals who are deaf or hard of  hearing alleging that public entities expect them to provide their own  sign language interpreters. Proposed Sec.  35.160(c)(1) was intended to  clarify that when a public entity is interacting with a person with a  disability, it is the public entity's responsibility to provide an  interpreter to ensure effective communication. It is not appropriate to  require the person with a disability to bring another individual to  provide such services.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.160(c)(2) of the NPRM proposed codifying the Department's  position that there are certain limited instances when a public entity  may rely on an accompanying individual to interpret or facilitate  communication: (1) In an emergency involving a threat to the public  safety or welfare; or (2) if the individual with a disability  specifically requests it, the accompanying individual agrees to provide  the assistance, and reliance on that individual for this assistance is  appropriate under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters supported this provision, but sought more specific  language to address what they see as a particularly entrenched problem.  Some commenters requested that the Department explicitly require the  public entity first to notify the individual with a disability that the  individual has a right to request and receive appropriate auxiliary aids  and services without charge from the public entity before using that  person's accompanying individual as a communication facilitator.  Advocates stated that an individual who is unaware of his or her rights  may decide to use a third party simply because he or she believes that  is the only way to communicate with the public entity.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has determined that inclusion of specific language  requiring notification is unnecessary. Section 35.160(b)(1) already  states that is the responsibility of the public entity to provide  auxiliary aids and services. Moreover, Sec.  35.130(f) already prohibits  the public entity from imposing a surcharge on a particular individual  with a disability or on any group of individuals with disabilities to  cover the costs of auxiliary aids. However, the Department strongly  advises public entities that they should first inform the individual  with a disability that the public entity can and will provide auxiliary  aids and services, and that there would be no cost for such aids or  services.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters requested that the Department make clear that the  public entity cannot request, rely upon, or coerce an adult accompanying  an individual with a disability to provide effective communication for  that individual with a disability--that only a voluntary offer is  acceptable. The Department states unequivocally that consent of, and  for, the adult accompanying the individual with a disability to  facilitate communication must be provided freely and voluntarily both by  the individual with a disability and the accompanying third party-- absent an emergency involving an imminent threat to the safety or  welfare of an individual or the public where there is no interpreter  available. The public entity may not coerce or attempt to persuade  another adult to provide effective communication for the individual with  a disability. Some commenters expressed concern that the regulation  could be read by public entities, including medical providers, to  prevent parents, guardians, or caregivers from providing effective  communication for children or that a child, regardless of age, would  have to specifically request that his or her caregiver act as  interpreter. The Department does not intend Sec.  35.160(c)(2) to  prohibit parents, guardians, or caregivers from providing effective  communication for children where so doing would be appropriate. Rather,  the rule prohibits public entities, including medical providers, from  requiring, relying on, or forcing adults accompanying individuals with  disabilities, including parents, guardians, or caregivers, to facilitate  communication.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters asked that the Department make absolutely clear  that children are not to be used to provide effective communication for  family members and   friends, and that it is the public entity's responsibility to provide  effective communication, stating that often interpreters are needed in  settings where it would not be appropriate for children to be  interpreting, such as those involving medical issues, domestic violence,  or other situations involving the exchange of confidential or adult- related material. Commenters observed that children are often hesitant  to turn down requests to provide communication services, and that such  requests put them in a very difficult position vis-a-vis family members  and friends. The Department agrees. It is the Department's position that  a public entity shall not rely on a minor child to facilitate  communication with a family member, friend, or other individual, except  in an emergency involving imminent threat to the safety or welfare of an  individual or the public where there is no interpreter available.  Accordingly, the Department has revised the rule to state: ``A public  entity shall not rely on a minor child to interpret or facilitate  communication, except in an emergency involving imminent threat to the  safety or welfare of an individual or the public where there is no  interpreter available.'' Sec.  35.160(c)(3). Sections 35.160(c)(2) and  (3) have no application in circumstances where an interpreter would not  otherwise be required in order to provide effective communication (e.g.,  in simple transactions such as purchasing movie tickets at a theater).  The Department stresses that privacy and confidentiality must be  maintained but notes that covered entities, such as hospitals, that are  subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of  1996 (HIPAA), Public Law 104-191, Privacy Rules are permitted to  disclose to a patient's relative, close friend, or any other person  identified by the patient (such as an interpreter) relevant patient  information if the patient agrees to such disclosures. See 45 CFR parts  160 and 164. The agreement need not be in writing. Covered entities  should consult the HIPAA Privacy Rules regarding other ways disclosures  might be able to be made to such persons.</p><p class="depth0">With regard to emergency situations, the NPRM proposed permitting  reliance on an individual accompanying an individual with a disability  to interpret or facilitate communication in an emergency involving a  threat to the public safety or welfare. Commenters requested that the  Department make clear that often a public entity can obtain appropriate  auxiliary aids and services in advance of an emergency by making  necessary advance arrangements, particularly in anticipated emergencies  such as predicted dangerous weather or certain medical situations such  as childbirth. These commenters did not want public entities to be  relieved of their responsibilities to provide effective communication in  emergency situations, noting that the obligation to provide effective  communication may be more critical in such situations. Several  commenters requested a separate rule that requires public entities to  provide timely and effective communication in the event of an emergency,  noting that the need for effective communication escalates in an  emergency.</p><p class="depth0">Commenters also expressed concern that public entities, particularly  law enforcement authorities and medical personnel, would apply the  ``emergency situation'' provision in inappropriate circumstances and  would rely on accompanying individuals without making any effort to seek  appropriate auxiliary aids and services. Other commenters asked that the  Department narrow this provision so that it would not be available to  entities that are responsible for emergency preparedness and response.  Some commenters noted that certain exigent circumstances, such as those  that exist during and perhaps immediately after, a major hurricane,  temporarily may excuse public entities of their responsibilities to  provide effective communication. However, they asked that the Department  clarify that these obligations are ongoing and that, as soon as such  situations begin to abate or stabilize, the public entity must provide  effective communication.</p><p class="depth0">The Department recognizes that the need for effective communication  is critical in emergency situations. After due consideration of all of  these concerns raised by commenters, the Department has revised Sec.   35.160(c) to narrow the exception permitting reliance on individuals  accompanying the individual with a disability during an emergency to  make it clear that it only applies to emergencies involving an  ``imminent threat to the safety or welfare of an individual or the  public.'' See Sec.  35.160(c)(2)-(3). Arguably, all visits to an  emergency room or situations to which emergency workers respond are by  definition emergencies. Likewise, an argument can be made that most  situations that law enforcement personnel respond to involve, in one way  or another, a threat to the safety or welfare of an individual or the  public. The imminent threat exception in Sec.  35.160(c)(2)-(3) is not  intended to apply to the typical and foreseeable emergency situations  that are part of the normal operations of these institutions. As such, a  public entity may rely on an accompanying individual to interpret or  facilitate communication under the Sec.  35.160(c)(2)-(3) imminent  threat exception only where in truly exigent circumstances, i.e., where  any delay in providing immediate services to the individual could have  life-altering or life-ending consequences.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters urged the Department to stress the obligation of  State and local courts to provide effective communication.   The Department has received many complaints that State and local courts  often do not provide needed qualified sign language interpreters to  witnesses, litigants, jurors, potential jurors, and companions and  associates of persons participating in the legal process. The Department  cautions public entities that without appropriate auxiliary aids and  services, such individuals are denied an opportunity to participate  fully in the judicial process, and denied benefits of the judicial  system that are available to others.</p><p class="depth0">Another common complaint about access to State and local court  systems is the failure to provide effective communication in deferral  programs that are intended as an alternative to incarceration, or for  other court-ordered treatment programs. These programs must provide  effective communication, and courts referring individuals with  disabilities to such programs should only refer individuals with  disabilities to programs or treatment centers that provide effective  communication. No person with a disability should be denied access to  the benefits conferred through participation in a court-ordered referral  program on the ground that the program purports to be unable to provide  effective communication.</p><p class="depth0">The general nondiscrimination provision in Sec.  35.130(a) provides  that no individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability,  be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the  services, programs, or activities of a public entity. The Department  consistently interprets this provision and Sec.  35.160 to require  effective communication in courts, jails, prisons, and with law  enforcement officers. Persons with disabilities who are participating in  the judicial process as witnesses, jurors, prospective jurors, parties  before the court, or companions of persons with business in the court,  should be provided auxiliary aids and services as needed for effective  communication. The Department has developed a variety of technical  assistance and guidance documents on the requirements for title II  entities to provide effective communication; those materials are  available on the Department Web site at: http://www.ada.gov.</p><p class="depth0">Many advocacy groups urged the Department to add language in the  final rule that would require public entities to provide accessible  material in a manner that is timely, accurate, and private. The  Department has included language in Sec.  35.160(b)(2) stating that  ``[i]n order to be effective, auxiliary aids and services must be  provided in accessible formats, in a timely manner, and in such a way so  as to protect the privacy and independence of the individual with a  disability.''</p><p class="depth0">Because the appropriateness of particular auxiliary aids and  services may vary as a situation changes, the Department strongly  encourages public entities to do a communication assessment of the  individual with a disability when the need for auxiliary aids and  services is first identified, and to re-assess communication  effectiveness regularly throughout the communication. For example, a  deaf individual may go to an emergency department of a public community  health center with what is at first believed to be a minor medical  emergency, such as a sore knee, and the individual with a disability and  the public community health center both believe that exchanging written  notes will be effective. However, during that individual's visit, it is  determined that the individual is, in fact, suffering from an anterior  cruciate ligament tear and must have surgery to repair the torn  ligament. As the situation develops and the diagnosis and recommended  course of action evolve into surgery, an interpreter most likely will be  necessary. A public entity has a continuing obligation to assess the  auxiliary aids and services it is providing, and should consult with  individuals with disabilities on a continuing basis to assess what  measures are required to ensure effective communication. Public entities  are further advised to keep individuals with disabilities apprised of  the status of the expected arrival of an interpreter or the delivery of  other requested or anticipated auxiliary aids and services.</p><p class="depth0">Video remote interpreting (VRI) services. In Sec.  35.160(d) of the  NPRM, the Department proposed the inclusion of four performance  standards for VRI (which the NPRM termed video interpreting services  (VIS)), for effective communication: (1) High-quality, clear, real-time,  full-motion video and audio over a dedicated high-speed Internet  connection; (2) a clear, sufficiently large, and sharply delineated  picture of the participating individual's head, arms, hands, and  fingers, regardless of his body position; (3) clear transmission of  voices; and (4) persons who are trained to set up and operate the VRI  quickly. Commenters generally approved of those performance standards,  but recommended that some additional standards be included in the final  rule. Some State agencies and advocates for persons with disabilities  requested that the Department add more detail in the description of the  first standard, including modifying the term ``dedicated high-speed  Internet connection'' to read ``dedicated high-speed, wide-bandwidth  video connection.'' These commenters argued that this change was  necessary to ensure a high-quality video image that will not produce  lags, choppy images, or irregular pauses in communication. The  Department agrees with those comments and has amended the provision in  the final rule accordingly.</p><p class="depth0">For persons who are deaf with limited vision, commenters requested  that the Department include an explicit requirement that interpreters  wear high-contrast clothing with no patterns that might distract from   their hands as they are interpreting, so that a person with limited  vision can see the signs made by the interpreter. While the Department  reiterates the importance of such practices in the delivery of effective  VRI, as well as in-person interpreting, the Department declines to adopt  such performance standards as part of this rule. In general,  professional interpreters already follow such practices--the Code of  Professional Conduct for interpreters developed by the Registry of  Interpreters for the Deaf, Inc. and the National Association of the Deaf  incorporates attire considerations into their standards of  professionalism and conduct. (This code is available at http:// www.vid.org/userfiles/file/pdfs/codeofethics.pdf (Last visited July 18,  2010). Moreover, as a result of this code, many VRI agencies have  adopted detailed dress standards that interpreters hired by the agency  must follow. In addition, commenters urged that a clear image of the  face and eyes of the interpreter and others be explicitly required.  Because the face includes the eyes, the Department has amended Sec.   35.160(d)(2) of the final rule to include a requirement that the  interpreter's face be displayed.</p><p class="depth0">In response to comments seeking more training for users and non- technicians responsible for VRI in title II facilities, the Department  is extending the requirement in Sec.  35.160(d)(4) to require training  for ``users of the technology'' so that staff who would have reason to  use the equipment in an emergency room, State or local court, or  elsewhere are properly trained. Providing for such training will enhance  the success of VRI as means of providing effective communication.</p><p class="depth0">Captioning at sporting venues. In the NPRM at Sec.  35.160(e), the  Department proposed that sports stadiums that have a capacity of 25,000  or more shall provide captioning for safety and emergency information on  scoreboards and video monitors. In addition, the Department posed four  questions about captioning of information, especially safety and  emergency information announcements, provided over public address (PA)  systems. The Department received many extremely detailed and divergent  responses to each of the four questions and the proposed regulatory  text. Because comments submitted on the Department's title II and title  III proposals were intertwined, because of the similarity of issues  involved for title II entities and title III entities, and in  recognition of the fact that many large sports stadiums are covered by  both title II and title III as joint operations of State or local  governments and one or more public accommodations, the Department  presents here a single consolidated review and summary of the issues  raised in comments.</p><p class="depth0">The Department asked whether requiring captioning of safety and  emergency information made over the public address system in stadiums  seating fewer than 25,000 would create an undue burden for smaller  entities, whether it would be feasible for small stadiums, or whether a  larger threshold, such as sports stadiums with a capacity of 50,000 or  more, would be appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">There was a consensus among the commenters, including disability  advocates as well as venue owners and stadium designers and operators,  that using the stadium size or seating capacity as the exclusive  deciding factor for any obligation to provide captioning for safety and  emergency information broadcast over the PA system is not preferred.  Most disability advocacy organizations and individuals with disabilities  complained that using size or seating capacity as a threshold for  captioning safety and emergency information would undermine the ``undue  burden'' defense found in both titles II and III. Many commenters  provided examples of facilities like professional hockey arenas that  seat less than 25,000 fans but which, commenters argued, should be able  to provide real-time captioning. Other commenters suggested that some  high school or college stadiums, for example, may hold 25,000 fans or  more and yet lack the resources to provide real-time captioning. Many  commenters noted that real-time captioning would require trained  stenographers and that most high school and college sports facilities  rely upon volunteers to operate scoreboards and PA systems, and they  would not be qualified stenographers, especially in case of an  emergency. One national association noted that the typical stenographer  expense for a professional football game in Washington, DC is about $550  per game. Similarly, one trade association representing venues estimated  that the cost for a professional stenographer at a sporting event runs  between $500 and $1,000 per game or event, the cost of which, they  argued, would be unduly burdensome in many cases. Some commenters  posited that schools that do not sell tickets to athletic events would  find it difficult to meet such expenses, in contrast to major college  athletic programs and professional sports teams, which would be less  likely to prevail using an ``undue burden'' defense.</p><p class="depth0">Some venue owners and operators and other covered entities argued  that stadium size should not be the key consideration when requiring  scoreboard captioning. Instead, these entities suggested that equipment  already installed in the stadium, including necessary electrical  equipment and backup power supply, should be the determining factor for  whether captioning is mandated. Many commenters argued that the  requirement to provide captioning should only apply to stadiums with  scoreboards that meet the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)  National Fire Alarm Code   (NFPA 72). Commenters reported that NFPA 72 requires at least two  independent and reliable power supplies for emergency information  systems, including one source that is a generator or battery sufficient  to run the system in the event the primary power fails. Alternatively,  some stadium designers and title II entities commented that the  requirement should apply when the facility has at least one elevator  providing firefighter emergency operation, along with approval of  authorities with responsibility for fire safety. Other commenters argued  for flexibility in the requirements for providing captioning and that  any requirement should only apply to stadiums constructed after the  effective date of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department also asked whether the rule should  address the specific means of captioning equipment, whether it should be  provided through any effective means (scoreboards, line boards, handheld  devices, or other means), or whether some means, such as handheld  devices, should be eliminated as options. This question elicited many  comments from advocates for persons with disabilities as well as from  covered entities. Advocacy organizations and individuals with experience  using handheld devices argue that such devices do not provide effective  communication. These commenters noted that information is often delayed  in the transmission to such devices, making them hard to use when  following action on the playing field or in the event of an emergency  when the crowd is already reacting to aural information provided over  the PA system well before it is received on the handheld device.</p><p class="depth0">Several venue owners and operators and others commented that  handheld technology offers advantages of flexibility and portability so  that it may be used successfully regardless of where in the facility the  user is located, even when not in the line of sight of a scoreboard or  other captioning system. Still other commenters urged the Department not  to regulate in such a way as to limit innovation and use of such  technology now and in the future. Cost considerations were included in  some comments from some stadium designers and venue owners and  operators, who reported that the cost of providing handheld systems is  far less than the cost of real-time captioning on scoreboards,  especially in facilities that do not currently have the capacity to  provide real-time captions on existing equipment. Others noted that  handheld technology is not covered by fire and safety model codes,  including the NFPA, and thus would be more easily adapted into existing  facilities if captioning were required by the Department.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also asked about providing open captioning of all  public address announcements, and not limiting captioning to safety and  emergency information. A variety of advocates and persons with  disabilities argued that all information broadcast over a PA system  should be captioned in real time at all facilities in order to provide  effective communication and that a requirement only to provide emergency  and safety information would not be sufficient. A few organizations for  persons with disabilities commented that installation of new systems  should not be required, but that all systems within existing facilities  that are capable of providing captioning must be utilized to the maximum  extent possible to provide captioning of as much information as  possible. Several organizations representing persons with disabilities  commented that all facilities must include in safety planning the  requirement to caption all aurally-provided information for patrons with  communication disabilities. Some advocates suggested that demand for  captions will only increase as the number of deaf and hard of hearing  persons grows with the aging of the general population and with  increasing numbers of veterans returning from war with disabilities.  Multiple comments noted that the captioning would benefit others as well  as those with communication disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">By contrast, venue owners and operators and others commented that  the action on the sports field is self-explanatory and does not require  captioning and they objected to an explicit requirement to provide real- time captioning for all information broadcast on the PA system at a  sporting event. Other commenters objected to requiring captioning even  for emergency and safety information over the scoreboard rather than  through some other means. By contrast, venue operators, State government  agencies, and some model code groups, including NFPA, commented that  emergency and safety information must be provided in an accessible  format and that public safety is a paramount concern. Other commenters  argued that the best method to deliver safety and emergency information  would be television monitors showing local TV broadcasts with captions  already mandated by the FCC. Some commenters posited that the most  reliable information about a major emergency would be provided on the  television news broadcasts. Several commenters argued that television  monitors may be located throughout the facility, improving line of sight  for patrons, some of whom might not be able to see the scoreboard from  their seats or elsewhere in the facility. Some stadium designers, venue  operators, and model code groups pointed out that video monitors are not  regulated by the NFPA or other agencies, so that such monitors could be  more easily provided. Video monitors may receive transmissions from  within the facility and could provide real-time captions if there is the  necessary software and equipment to feed the captioning signal to a  closed video network   within the facility. Several comments suggested that using monitors  would be preferable to requiring captions on the scoreboard if the  regulation mandates real-time captioning. Some venue owners and  operators argued that retrofitting existing stadiums with new systems  could easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per scoreboard or  system. Some stadium designers and others argued that captioning should  only be required in stadiums built after the effective date of the  regulation. For stadiums with existing systems that allow for real-time  captioning, one commenter posited that dedicating the system exclusively  to real-time captioning would lead to an annual loss of between $2 and  $3 million per stadium in revenue from advertising currently running in  that space.</p><p class="depth0">After carefully considering the wide range of public comments on  this issue, the Department has concluded that the final rule will not  provide additional requirements for effective communication or emergency  information provided at sports stadiums at this time. The 1991 title II  and title III regulations and statutory requirements are not in any way  affected by this decision. The decision to postpone rulemaking on this  complex issue is based on a number of factors, including the multiple  layers of existing regulation by various agencies and levels of  government, and the wide array of information, requests, and  recommendations related to developing technology offered by the public.  In addition, there is a huge variety of covered entities, information  and communication systems, and differing characteristics among sports  stadiums. The Department has concluded that further consideration and  review would be prudent before it issues specific regulatory  requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.161 Telecommunications.</p><p class="depth0">The Department proposed to retitle this section  ``Telecommunications'' to reflect situations in which the public entity  must provide an effective means to communicate by telephone for  individuals with disabilities. First, the NPRM proposed redesignating  Sec.  35.161 as Sec.  35.161(a) and replacing the term  ``Telecommunications devices for the deaf (TDD)'' with ``Text telephones  (TTY).'' Public comment was universally supportive of this change in  nomenclature to TTY.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, at Sec.  35.161(b), the Department addressed automated- attendant systems that handle telephone calls electronically. Often  individuals with disabilities, including persons who are deaf or hard of  hearing, are unable to use such automated systems. Some systems are not  compatible with TTYs or the telecommunications relay service. Automated  systems can and often do disconnect calls from TTYs or relay calls,  making it impossible for persons using a TTY or relay system to do  business with title II entities in the same manner as others. The  Department proposed language that would require a telecommunications  service to permit persons using relay or TTYs or other assistive  technology to use the automated-attendant system provided by the public  entity. The FCC raised this concern with the Department after the 1991  title II regulation went into effect, and the Department acted upon that  request in the NPRM. Comments from disability advocates and persons with  disabilities consistently requested the provision be amended to cover  ``voice mail, messaging, auto-attendant, and interactive voice response  systems.'' The Department recognizes that those are important features  of widely used telecommunications technology that should be as  accessible to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing as they are to  others, and has amended the section in the final rule to include the  additional features.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters, including advocates and persons with disabilities,  as well as State agencies and national organizations, asked that all  automated systems have an option for the caller to bypass the automated  system and speak to a live person who could communicate using relay  services. The Department understands that automated telecommunications  systems typically do not offer the opportunity to avoid or bypass the  automated system and speak to a live person. The Department believes  that at this time it is inappropriate to add a requirement that all such  systems provide an override capacity that permits a TTY or relay caller  to speak with a live clerk on a telecommunications relay system.  However, if a system already provides an option to speak to a person,  that system must accept TTY and relay calls and must not disconnect or  refuse to accept such calls.</p><p class="depth0">Other comments from advocacy organizations and individuals urged the  Department to require specifications for the operation of such systems  that would involve issuing technical requirements for encoding and  storage of automated text, as well as controls for speed, pause, rewind,  and repeat, and prompts without any background noise. The same comments  urged that these requirements should be consistent with a pending  advisory committee report to the Access Board, submitted in April 2008.  See Telecommunications and Electronic Information Technology Advisory  Committee, Report to the Access Board Refreshed Accessibility Standards  and Guidelines in Telecommunications and Electronic and Information  Technology (Apr. 2008) available at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/ refresh/report/. The Department is declining at this time to preempt  ongoing consideration of these issues by the Board. Instead, the  Department   will monitor activity by the Board. The Department is convinced that the  general requirement to make such automated systems usable by persons  with disabilities is appropriate at this time and title II entities  should evaluate their automated systems in light of concerns about  providing systems that offer effective communication to persons with  disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Finally, the Department has adopted in Sec.  35.161(c) of the final  rule the requirement that all such systems must not disconnect or refuse  to take calls from all forms of FCC-approved telecommunications relay  systems, including Internet-based relay systems. (Internet-based relay  systems refer to the mechanism by which the message is relayed). They do  not require a public entity to have specialized computer equipment.  Commenters from some State agencies, many advocacy organizations, and  individuals strongly urged the Department to mandate such action because  of the high proportion of TTY calls and relay service calls that are not  completed because the title II entity's phone system or employees do not  take the calls. This presents a serious obstacle for persons doing  business with State and local government and denies persons with  disabilities access to use the telephone for business that is typically  handled over the phone for others.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, commenters requested that the Department include  ``real-time'' before any mention of ``computer-aided'' technology to  highlight the value of simultaneous translation of any communication.  The Department has added ``real-time'' before ``computer-aided  transcription services'' in the definition of ``auxiliary aids in Sec.   35.104 and before ``communication'' in Sec.  35.161(b).</p><p class="depth0">Subpart F--Compliance Procedures</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.171 Acceptance of complaints.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed changing the current language  in Sec.  35.171(a)(2)(i) regarding misdirected complaints to make it  clear that if an agency receives a complaint for which it lacks  jurisdiction either under section 504 or as a designated agency under  the ADA, the agency may refer the complaint to the appropriate agency  with title II or section 504 jurisdiction or to the Department of  Justice. The language of the 1991 title II regulation only requires the  agency to refer such a complaint to the Department, which in turn refers  the complaint to the appropriate designated agency. The proposed  revisions to Sec.  35.171 made it clear that an agency can refer a  misdirected complaint either directly to the appropriate agency or to  the Department. This amendment was intended to protect against the  unnecessary backlogging of complaints and to prevent undue delay in an  agency taking action on a complaint.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters supported this amendment as a more efficient  means of directing title II complaints to the appropriate enforcing  agency. One commenter requested that the Department emphasize the need  for timeliness in referring a complaint. The Department does not believe  it is appropriate to adopt a specific time frame but will continue to  encourage designated agencies to make timely referrals. The final rule  retains, with minor modifications, the language in proposed Sec.   35.171(a)(2)(i). The Department has also amended Sec.  35.171(a)(2)(ii)  to be consistent with the changes in the rule at Sec.  35.190(e), as  discussed below.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.172 Investigations and compliance reviews.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department proposed a number of changes to language  in Sec.  35.172 relating to the resolution of complaints. Subtitle A of  title II of the ADA defines the remedies, procedures, and rights  provided for qualified individuals with disabilities who are  discriminated against on the basis of disability in the services,  programs, or activities of State and local governments. 42 U.S.C. 12131- 12134. Subpart F of the current regulation establishes administrative  procedures for the enforcement of title II of the ADA. 28 CFR 35.170- 35.178. Subpart G identifies eight ``designated agencies,'' including  the Department, that have responsibility for investigating complaints  under title II. See 28 CFR 35.190(b).</p><p class="depth0">The Department's 1991 title II regulation is based on the  enforcement procedures established in regulations implementing section  504. Thus, the Department's 1991 title II regulation provides that the  designated agency ``shall investigate each complete complaint'' alleging  a violation of title II and shall ``attempt informal resolution'' of  such complaint. 28 CFR 35.172(a). The full range of remedies (including  compensatory damages) that are available to the Department when it  resolves a complaint or resolves issues raised in a compliance review  are available to designated agencies when they are engaged in informal  complaint resolution or resolution of issues raised in a compliance  review under title II.</p><p class="depth0">In the years since the 1991 title II regulation went into effect,  the Department has received many more complaints alleging violations of  title II than its resources permit it to resolve. The Department has  reviewed each complaint that the Department has received and directed  its resources to resolving the most critical matters. In the NPRM, the  Department proposed deleting the word ``each'' as it appears before  ``complaint'' in Sec.  35.172(a) of the 1991 title II regulation as a  means of clarifying that designated agencies may exercise discretion in  selecting title II complaints for resolution.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters opposed the removal of the term ``each,'' requesting  that all title II complaints be investigated. The commenters explained  that complaints against title II entities implicate the fundamental  right of access to government facilities and programs, making an  administrative enforcement mechanism critical. Rather than aligning  enforcement discretion of title II complaints with the discretion under  the enforcement procedures of title III, the commenters favored  obtaining additional resources to address more complaints. The  commenters highlighted the advantage afforded by Federal involvement in  complaint investigations in securing favorable voluntary resolutions.  When Federal involvement results in settlement agreements, commenters  believed those agreements are more persuasive to other public entities  than private settlements. Private litigation as a viable alternative was  rejected by the commenters because of the financial limitations of many  complainants, and because in some scenarios legal barriers foreclose  private litigation as an option.</p><p class="depth0">Several of those opposing this amendment argued that designated  agencies are required to investigate each complaint under section 504,  and a departure for title II complaints would be an inconsistency. The  Department believes that Sec.  35.171(a) of the final rule is consistent  with the obligation to evaluate all complaints. However, there is no  statutory requirement that every title II complaint receive a full  investigation. Section 203 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12133, adopts the  ``remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in section 505 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973'' (29 U.S.C. 794a). Section 505 of the  Rehabilitation Act, in turn, incorporates the remedies available under  title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into section 504. Under these  statutes, agencies may engage in conscientious enforcement without fully  investigating each citizen complaint. An agency's decision to conduct a  full investigation requires a complicated balancing of a number of  factors that are particularly within its expertise. Thus, the agency  must not only assess whether a violation may have occurred, but also  whether agency resources are best spent on this complaint or another,  whether the agency is likely to succeed if it acts, and whether the  particular enforcement action requested best fits the agency's overall  policies. Availability of resources will always be a factor, and the  Department believes discretion to maximize these limited resources will  result in the most effective enforcement program. If agencies are bound  to investigate each complaint fully, regardless of merit, such a  requirement could have a deleterious effect on their overall enforcement  efforts. The Department continues to expect that each designated agency  will review the complaints the agency receives to determine whether  further investigation is appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also proposed revising Sec.  35.172 to add a new  paragraph (b) that provided explicit authority for compliance reviews  consistent with the Department's longstanding position that such  authority exists. The proposed section stated, ``[t]he designated agency  may conduct compliance reviews of public entities based on information  indicating a possible failure to comply with the nondiscrimination  requirements of this part.'' Several commenters supported this  amendment, identifying title III compliance reviews as having been a  successful means for the Department and designated agencies to improve  accessibility. The Department has retained this section. However, the  Department has modified the language of the section to make the  authority to conduct compliance reviews consistent with that available  under section 504 and title VI. See, e.g., 28 CFR 42.107(a). The new  provision reads as follows: ``(b) The designated agency may conduct  compliance reviews of public entities in order to ascertain whether  there has been a failure to comply with the nondiscrimination  requirements of this part.'' The Department has also added a provision  to Sec.  35.172(c)(2) clarifying the Department's longstanding view that  agencies may obtain compensatory damages on behalf of complainants as  the result of a finding of discrimination pursuant to a compliance  review or in informal resolution of a complaint.</p><p class="depth0">Finally, in the NPRM, the Department proposed revising the  requirements for letters of findings for clarification and to reflect  current practice. Section 35.172(a) of the 1991 title II regulation  required designated agencies to issue a letter of findings at the  conclusion of an investigation if the complaint was not resolved  informally, and to attempt to negotiate a voluntary compliance agreement  if a violation was found. The Department's proposed changes to the 1991  title II regulation moved the discussion of letters of findings to a new  paragraph (c) in the NPRM, and clarified that letters of findings are  only required when a violation is found.</p><p class="depth0">One commenter opposed the proposal to eliminate the obligation of  the Department and designated agencies to issue letters of finding at  the conclusion of every investigation. The commenter argued that it is  beneficial for public entities, as well as complainants, for the  Department to provide a reasonable explanation of both compliance and  noncompliance findings.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has considered this comment but continues to believe  that this change will promote the overall effectiveness of its  enforcement program. The final rule retains the proposed language.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart G--Designated Agencies</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.190 Designated agencies.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart G of the 1991 title II regulation designates specific  Federal agencies to investigate certain title II complaints. Paragraph  35.190(b) specifies these agency designations. Paragraphs 35.190(c) and  (d), respectively, grant the Department discretion to designate further  oversight responsibilities for matters not specifically assigned or  where there are apparent conflicts of jurisdiction. The NPRM proposed  adding a new Sec.  35.190(e) further refining procedures for complaints  filed with the Department of Justice. Proposed Sec.  35.190(e) provides  that when the Department receives a complaint alleging a violation of  title II that is directed to the Attorney General but may fall within  the jurisdiction of a designated agency or another Federal agency with  jurisdiction under section 504, the Department may exercise its  discretion to retain the complaint for investigation under this part.  The Department would, of course, consult with the designated agency when  the Department plans to retain a complaint. In appropriate  circumstances, the Department and the designated agency may conduct a  joint investigation.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters supported this amendment as a more efficient  means of processing title II complaints. The commenters supported the  Department using its discretion to conduct timely investigations of such  complaints. The language of the proposed Sec.  35.190(e) remains  unchanged in the final rule.</p><p class="depth0">Other Issues</p><p class="depth0">Questions Posed in the NPRM Regarding Costs and Benefits of Complying</p><p class="depth0">With the 2010 Standards</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department requested comment on various cost and  benefit issues related to eight requirements in the Department's Initial  Regulatory Impact Analysis (Initial RIA), available at ada.gov/NPRM2008/ ria.htm), that were projected to have incremental costs exceeding  monetized benefits by more than $100 million when using the 1991  Standards as the comparative baseline, i.e., side reach, water closet  clearances in single-user toilet rooms with in-swinging doors, stairs,  elevators, location of accessible routes to stages, accessible attorney  areas and witness stands, assistive listening systems, and accessible  teeing grounds, putting greens, and weather shelters at golf courses. 73  FR 34466, 34469 (June 17, 2008). The Department noted that pursuant to  the ADA, the Department does not have statutory authority to modify the  2004 ADAAG and is required instead to issue regulations implementing the  ADA that are consistent with the Board's guidelines. In that regard, the  Department also requested comment about whether any of these eight  elements in the 2010 Standards should be returned to the Access Board  for further consideration, in particular as applied to alterations. Many  of the comments received by the Department in response to these  questions addressed both titles II and III. As a result, the  Department's discussion of these comments and its response are  collectively presented for both titles.</p><p class="depth0">Side reach. The 1991 Standards at section 4.2.6 establish a maximum  side-reach height of 54 inches. The 2010 Standards at section 308.3  reduce that maximum height to 48 inches. The 2010 Standards also add  exceptions for certain elements to the scoping requirement for operable  parts.</p><p class="depth0">The vast majority of comments the Department received were in  support of the lower side-reach maximum of 48 inches in the 2010  Standards. Most of these comments, but not all, were received from  individuals of short stature, relatives of individuals of short stature,  or organizations representing the interests of persons with  disabilities, including individuals of short stature. Comments from  individuals with disabilities and disability advocacy groups stated that  the 48-inch side reach would permit independence in performing many  activities of daily living for individuals with disabilities, including  individuals of short stature, persons who use wheelchairs, and persons  who have limited upper body strength. In this regard, one commenter who  is a business owner pointed out that as a person of short stature there  were many occasions when he was unable to exit a public restroom  independently because he could not reach the door handle. The commenter  said that often elevator control buttons are out of his reach and, if he  is alone, he often must wait for someone else to enter the elevator so  that he can ask that person to press a floor button for him. Another  commenter, who is also a person of short stature, said that he has on  several occasions pulled into a gas station only to find that he was  unable to reach the credit card reader on the gas pump. Unlike other  customers who can reach the card reader, swipe their credit or debit  cards, pump their gas and leave the station, he must use another method  to pay for his gas. Another comment from a person of short stature  pointed out that as more businesses take steps to reduce labor costs--a  trend expected to continue--staffed booths are being replaced with  automatic machines for the sale, for example, of parking tickets and  other products. He observed that the ``ability to access and operate  these machines becomes ever more critical to function in society,'' and,  on that basis, urged the Department to adopt the 48-inch side-reach  requirement. Another individual commented that persons of short stature  should not have to carry with them   adaptive tools in order to access building or facility elements that are  out of their reach, any more than persons in wheelchairs should have to  carry ramps with them in order to gain access to facilities.</p><p class="depth0">Many of the commenters who supported the revised side-reach  requirement pointed out that lowering the side-reach requirement to 48  inches would avoid a problem sometimes encountered in the built  environment when an element was mounted for a parallel approach at 54  inches only to find afterwards that a parallel approach was not  possible. Some commenters also suggested that lowering the maximum  unobstructed side reach to 48 inches would reduce confusion among design  professionals by making the unobstructed forward and side-reach maximums  the same (the unobstructed forward reach in both the 1991 and 2010  Standards is 48 inches maximum). These commenters also pointed out that  the ICC/ANSI A117.1 Standard, which is a private sector model  accessibility standard, has included a 48-inch maximum high side-reach  requirement since 1998. Many jurisdictions have already incorporated  this requirement into their building codes, which these commenters  believed would reduce the cost of compliance with the 2010 Standards.  Because numerous jurisdictions have already adopted the 48-inch side- reach requirement, the Department's failure to adopt the 48-inch side- reach requirement in the 2010 Standards, in the view of many commenters,  would result in a significant reduction in accessibility, and would  frustrate efforts that have been made to harmonize private sector model  construction and accessibility codes with Federal accessibility  requirements. Given these concerns, they overwhelmingly opposed the idea  of returning the revised side-reach requirement to the Access Board for  further consideration.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also received comments in support of the 48-inch  side-reach requirement from an association of professional commercial  property managers and operators and from State governmental entities.  The association of property managers pointed out that the revised side- reach requirement provided a reasonable approach to ``regulating  elevator controls and all other operable parts'' in existing facilities  in light of the manner in which the safe harbor, barrier removal, and  alterations obligations will operate in the 2010 Standards. One  governmental entity, while fully supporting the 48-inch side-reach  requirement, encouraged the Department to adopt an exception to the  lower reach range for existing facilities similar to the exception  permitted in the ICC/ANSI A117.1 Standard. In response to this latter  concern, the Department notes that under the safe harbor, existing  facilities that are in compliance with the 1991 Standards, which require  a 54-inch side-reach maximum, would not be required to comply with the  lower side-reach requirement, unless there is an alteration. See Sec.   35.150(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">A number of commenters expressed either concern with, or opposition  to, the 48-inch side-reach requirement and suggested that it be returned  to the Access Board for further consideration. These commenters included  trade and business associations, associations of retail stores,  associations of restaurant owners, retail and convenience store chains,  and a model code organization. Several businesses expressed the view  that the lower side-reach requirement would discourage the use of their  products and equipment by most of the general public. In particular,  concerns were expressed by a national association of pay phone service  providers regarding the possibility that pay telephones mounted at the  lower height would not be used as frequently by the public to place  calls, which would result in an economic burden on the pay phone  industry. The commenter described the lower height required for side  reach as creating a new ``barrier'' to pay phone use, which would reduce  revenues collected from pay phones and, consequently, further discourage  the installation of new pay telephones. In addition, the commenter  expressed concern that phone service providers would simply decide to  remove existing pay phones rather than incur the costs of relocating  them at the lower height. With regard to this latter concern, the  commenter misunderstood the manner in which the safe harbor obligation  will operate in the revised title II regulation for elements that comply  with the 1991 Standards. If the pay phones comply with the 1991  Standards or UFAS, the adoption of the 2010 Standards does not require  retrofitting of these elements to reflect incremental changes in the  2010 Standards (see Sec.  35.150(b)(2)). However, pay telephones that  were required to meet the 1991 Standards as part of new construction or  alterations, but do not in fact comply with those standards, will need  to be brought into compliance with the 2010 Standards as of 18 months  from the publication date of this final rule. See Sec.   35.151(c)(5)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">The Department does not agree with the concerns expressed by the  commenter about reduced revenues from pay phones mounted at lower  heights. The Department believes that, while given the choice some  individuals may prefer to use a pay phone that is at a higher height,  the availability of some phones at a lower height will not deter  individuals from making needed calls.</p><p class="depth0">The 2010 Standards will not require every pay phone to be installed  or moved to a lowered height. The table accompanying section 217.2 of  the 2010 Standards makes clear that, where one or more telephones are  provided on a floor, level, or an exterior site, only one phone per  floor, level, or exterior site must be placed at an accessible height.  Similarly, where there is one bank of phones per floor,   level, or exterior site, only one phone per floor, level, or exterior  site must be accessible. And if there are two or more banks of phones  per floor, level, or exterior site, only one phone per bank must be  placed at an accessible height.</p><p class="depth0">Another comment in opposition to the lower reach range requirement  was submitted on behalf of a chain of convenience stores with fuel  stops. The commenter expressed the concern that the 48-inch side reach  ``will make it uncomfortable for the majority of the public,'' including  persons of taller stature who would need to stoop to use equipment such  as fuel dispensers mounted at the lower height. The commenter offered no  objective support for the observation that a majority of the public  would be rendered uncomfortable if, as required in the 2010 Standards,  at least one of each type of fuel dispenser at a facility was made  accessible in compliance with the lower reach range. Indeed, the  Department received no comments from any individuals of tall stature  expressing concern about accessible elements or equipment being mounted  at the 48-inch height.</p><p class="depth0">Several convenience store, restaurant, and amusement park commenters  expressed concern about the burden the lower side-reach requirement  would place on their businesses in terms of self-service food stations  and vending areas if the 48-inch requirement were applied retroactively.  The cost of lowering counter height, in combination with the lack of  control businesses exercise over certain prefabricated service or  vending fixtures, outweighed, they argued, any benefits to persons with  disabilities. For this reason, they suggested the lower side-reach  requirement be referred back to the Access Board.</p><p class="depth0">These commenters misunderstood the safe harbor and barrier removal  obligations that will be in effect under the 2010 Standards. Those  existing self-service food stations and vending areas that already are  in compliance with the 1991 Standards will not be required to satisfy  the 2010 Standards unless they engage in alterations. With regard to  prefabricated vending machines and food service components that will be  purchased and installed in businesses after the 2010 Standards become  effective, the Department expects that companies will design these  machines and fixtures to comply with the 2010 Standards in the future,  as many have already done in the 10 years since the 48-inch side-reach  requirement has been a part of the model codes and standards used by  many jurisdictions as the basis for their construction codes.</p><p class="depth0">A model code organization commented that the lower side-reach  requirement would create a significant burden if it required entities to  lower the mounting height for light switches, environmental controls,  and outlets when an alteration did not include the walls where these  elements were located, such as when ``an area is altered or as a path of  travel obligation.'' The Department believes that the final rule  adequately addresses those situations about which the commenter  expressed concern by not requiring the relocation of existing elements,  such as light switches, environmental controls, and outlets, unless they  are altered. Moreover, under Sec.  35.151(b)(4)(iii) of the final rule,  costs for altering the path of travel to an altered area of primary  function that exceed 20 percent of the overall costs of the alteration  will be deemed disproportionate.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has determined that the revised side-reach  requirement should not be returned to the Access Board for further  consideration, based in large part on the views expressed by a majority  of the commenters regarding the need for, and importance of, the lower  side-reach requirement to ensure access for persons with disabilities.  Alterations and Water Closet Clearances in Single-User Toilet Rooms With</p><p class="depth0">In-Swinging Doors</p><p class="depth0">The 1991 Standards allow a lavatory to be placed a minimum of 18  inches from the water closet centerline and a minimum of 36 inches from  the side wall adjacent to the water closet, which precludes side  transfers. The 1991 Standards do not allow an in-swinging door in a  toilet or bathing room to overlap the required clear floor space at any  accessible fixture. To allow greater transfer options, section 604.3.2  of the 2010 Standards prohibits lavatories from overlapping the clear  floor space at water closets, except in residential dwelling units.  Section 603.2.3 of the 2010 Standards maintains the prohibition on doors  swinging into the clear floor space or clearance required for any  fixture, except that they permit the doors of toilet or bathing rooms to  swing into the required turning space, provided that there is sufficient  clearance space for the wheelchair outside the door swing. In addition,  in single-user toilet or bathing rooms, exception 2 of section 603.2.3  of the 2010 Standards permits the door to swing into the clear floor  space of an accessible fixture if a clear floor space that measures at  least 30 inches by 48 inches is available outside the arc of the door  swing.</p><p class="depth0">The majority of commenters believed that this requirement would  increase the number of toilet rooms accessible to individuals with  disabilities who use wheelchairs or mobility scooters, and will make it  easier for them to transfer. A number of commenters stated that there  was no reason to return this provision to the Access Board. Numerous  commenters noted that this requirement is already included in other  model accessibility standards and many State and local building codes  and that the adoption of the 2010   Standards is an important part of harmonization efforts.</p><p class="depth0">Other commenters, mostly trade associations, opposed this  requirement, arguing that the added cost to the industry outweighs any  increase in accessibility. Two commenters stated that these proposed  requirements would add two feet to the width of an accessible single- user toilet room; however, another commenter said the drawings in the  proposed regulation demonstrated that there would be no substantial  increase in the size of the toilet room. Several commenters stated that  this requirement would require moving plumbing fixtures, walls, or doors  at significant additional expense. Two commenters wanted the permissible  overlap between the door swing and clearance around any fixture  eliminated. One commenter stated that these new requirements will result  in fewer alterations to toilet rooms to avoid triggering the requirement  for increased clearances, and suggested that the Department specify that  repairs, maintenance, or minor alterations would not trigger the need to  provide increased clearances. Another commenter requested that the  Department exempt existing guest room bathrooms and single-user toilet  rooms that comply with the 1991 Standards from complying with the  increased clearances in alterations.</p><p class="depth0">After careful consideration of these comments, the Department  believes that the revised clearances for single-user toilet rooms will  allow safer and easier transfers for individuals with disabilities, and  will enable a caregiver, aide, or other person to accompany an  individual with a disability into the toilet room to provide assistance.  The illustrations in Appendix B to the final title III rule, ``Analysis  and Commentary on the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design,''  published elsewhere in this volume and codified as Appendix B to 28 CFR  part 36, describe several ways for public entities and public  accommodations to make alterations while minimizing additional costs or  loss of space. Further, in any isolated instances where existing  structural limitations may entail loss of space, the public entity and  public accommodation may have a technical infeasibility defense for that  alteration. The Department also recognizes that in attempting to create  the required clear floor space pursuant to section 604.3.2, there may be  certain specific circumstances where it would be technically infeasible  for a covered entity to comply with the clear floor space requirement,  such as where an entity must move a plumbing wall in a multistory  building where the mechanical chase for plumbing is an integral part of  a building's structure or where the relocation of a wall or fixture  would violate applicable plumbing codes. In such circumstances, the  required clear floor space would not have to be provided although the  covered entity would have to provide accessibility to the maximum extent  feasible. The Department has, therefore, decided not to return this  requirement to the Access Board.</p><p class="depth0">Alterations to stairs. The 1991 Standards only require interior and  exterior stairs to be accessible when they provide access to levels that  are not connected by an elevator, ramp, or other accessible means of  vertical access. In contrast, section 210.1 of the 2010 Standards  requires all newly constructed stairs that are part of a means of egress  to be accessible. However, exception 2 of section 210.1 of the 2010  Standards provides that in alterations, stairs between levels connected  by an accessible route need not be accessible, except that handrails  shall be provided. Most commenters were in favor of this requirement for  handrails in alterations, and stated that adding handrails to stairs  during alterations was not only feasible and not cost-prohibitive, but  also provided important safety benefits. One commenter stated that  making all points of egress accessible increased the number of people  who could use the stairs in an emergency. A majority of the commenters  did not want this requirement returned to the Access Board for further  consideration.</p><p class="depth0">The International Building Code (IBC), which is a private sector  model construction code, contains a similar provision, and most  jurisdictions enforce a version of the IBC as their building code,  thereby minimizing the impact of this provision on public entities and  public accommodations. The Department believes that by requiring only  the addition of handrails to altered stairs where levels are connected  by an accessible route, the costs of compliance for public entities and  public accommodations are minimized, while safe egress for individuals  with disabilities is increased. Therefore, the Department has decided  not to return this requirement to the Access Board.</p><p class="depth0">Alterations to elevators. Under the 1991 Standards, if an existing  elevator is altered, only that altered elevator must comply with the new  construction requirements for accessible elevators to the maximum extent  feasible. It is therefore possible that a bank of elevators controlled  by a single call system may contain just one accessible elevator,  leaving an individual with a disability with no way to call an  accessible elevator and thus having to wait indefinitely until an  accessible elevator happens to respond to the call system. In the 2010  Standards, when an element in one elevator is altered, section 206.6.1  will require the same element to be altered in all elevators that are  programmed to respond to the same call button as the altered elevator.</p><p class="depth0">Most commenters favored the proposed requirement. This requirement,  according to these commenters, is necessary so a person with a  disability need not wait until an accessible elevator responds to his or  her call.   One commenter suggested that elevator owners could also comply by  modifying the call system so the accessible elevator could be summoned  independently. One commenter suggested that this requirement would be  difficult for small businesses located in older buildings, and one  commenter suggested that this requirement be sent back to the Access  Board.</p><p class="depth0">After considering the comments, the Department agrees that this  requirement is necessary to ensure that when an individual with a  disability presses a call button, an accessible elevator will arrive in  a timely manner. The IBC contains a similar provision, and most  jurisdictions enforce a version of the IBC as their building code,  minimizing the impact of this provision on public entities and public  accommodations. Public entities and businesses located in older  buildings need not comply with this requirement where it is technically  infeasible to do so. Further, as pointed out by one commenter, modifying  the call system so the accessible elevator can be summoned independently  is another means of complying with this requirement in lieu of altering  all other elevators programmed to respond to the same call button.  Therefore, the Department has decided not to return this requirement to  the Access Board.</p><p class="depth0">Location of accessible routes to stages. The 1991 Standards at  section 4.33.5 require an accessible route to connect the accessible  seating and the stage, as well as other ancillary spaces used by  performers. The 2010 Standards at section 206.2.6 provide in addition  that where a circulation path directly connects the seating area and the  stage, the accessible route must directly connect the accessible seating  and the stage, and, like the 1991 Standards, an accessible route must  connect the stage with the ancillary spaces used by performers.</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department asked operators of auditoria about the  extent to which auditoria already provide direct access to stages and  whether there were planned alterations over the next 15 years that  included accessible direct routes to stages. The Department also asked  how to quantify the benefits of this requirement for persons with  disabilities, and invited commenters to provide illustrative anecdotal  experiences about the requirement's benefits. The Department received  many comments regarding the costs and benefits of this requirement.  Although little detail was provided, many industry and governmental  entity commenters anticipated that the costs of this requirement would  be great and that it would be difficult to implement. They noted that  premium seats may have to be removed and that load-bearing walls may  have to be relocated. These commenters suggested that the significant  costs would deter alterations to the stage area for a great many  auditoria. Some commenters suggested that ramps to the front of the  stage may interfere with means of egress and emergency exits. Several  commenters requested that the requirement apply to new construction  only, and one industry commenter requested an exemption for stages used  in arenas or amusement parks where there is no audience participation or  where the stage is a work area for performers only. One commenter  requested that the requirement not apply to temporary stages.</p><p class="depth0">The final rule does not require a direct accessible route to be  constructed where a direct circulation path from the seating area to the  stage does not exist. Consequently, those commenters who expressed  concern about the burden imposed by the revised requirement (i.e., where  the stage is constructed with no direct circulation path connecting the  general seating and performing area) should note that the final rule  will not require the provision of a direct accessible route under these  circumstances. The final rule applies to permanent stages, as well as  ``temporary stages,'' if there is a direct circulation path from the  seating area to the stage. However, the Department does recognize that  in some circumstances, such as an alteration to a primary function area,  the ability to provide a direct accessible route to a stage may be  costly or technically infeasible, the auditorium owner is not precluded  by the revised requirement from asserting defenses available under the  regulation. In addition, the Department notes that since section 4.33.5  of the 1991 Standards requires an accessible route to a stage, the safe  harbor will apply to existing facilities whose stages comply with the  1991 Standards.</p><p class="depth0">Several governmental entities supported accessible auditoria and the  revised requirement. One governmental entity noted that its State  building code already required direct access, that it was possible to  provide direct access, and that creative solutions had been found to do  so.</p><p class="depth0">Many advocacy groups and individual commenters strongly supported  the revised requirement, discussing the acute need for direct access to  stages as it impacts a great number of people at important life events  such as graduations and awards ceremonies, at collegiate and competitive  performances and other school events, and at entertainment events that  include audience participation. Many commenters expressed the belief  that direct access is essential for integration mandates to be satisfied  and that separate routes are stigmatizing and unequal. The Department  agrees with these concerns.</p><p class="depth0">Commenters described the impact felt by persons in wheelchairs who  are unable to access the stage at all when others are able to do so.  Some of these commenters also discussed the need for performers and  production staff who use wheelchairs to have direct   access to the stage and provided a number of examples that illustrated  the importance of the rule proposed in the NPRM. Personal anecdotes were  provided in comments and at the Department's public hearing on the NPRM.  One mother spoke passionately and eloquently about the unequal treatment  experienced by her daughter, who uses a wheelchair, at awards ceremonies  and band concerts. Her daughter was embarrassed and ashamed to be  carried by her father onto a stage at one band concert. When the venue  had to be changed for another concert to an accessible auditorium, the  band director made sure to comment that he was unhappy with the switch.  Rather than endure the embarrassment and indignities, her child dropped  out of band the following year. Another father commented about how he  was unable to speak from the stage at a PTA meeting at his child's  school. Speaking from the floor limited his line of sight and his  participation. Several examples were provided of children who could not  participate on stage during graduation, awards programs, or special  school events, such as plays and festivities. One student did not attend  his college graduation because he would not be able to get on stage.  Another student was unable to participate in the class Christmas  programs or end-of-year parties unless her father could attend and lift  her onto the stage. These commenters did not provide a method to  quantify the benefits that would accrue by having direct access to  stages. One commenter stated, however, that ``the cost of dignity and  respect is without measure.''</p><p class="depth0">Many industry commenters and governmental entities suggested that  the requirement be sent back to the Access Board for further  consideration. One industry commenter mistakenly noted that some  international building codes do not incorporate the requirement and that  therefore there is a need for further consideration. However, the  Department notes that both the 2003 and 2006 editions of the IBC include  scoping provisions that are almost identical to this requirement and  that these editions of the model code are the most frequently used. Many  individuals and advocacy group commenters requested that the requirement  be adopted without further delay. These commenters spoke of the acute  need for direct access to stages and the amount of time it would take to  resubmit the requirement to the Access Board. Several commenters noted  that the 2004 ADAAG tracks recent model codes and thus there is no need  for further consideration. The Department agrees that no further delay  is necessary and therefore has decided not to return the requirement to  the Access Board for further consideration.</p><p class="depth0">Attorney areas and witness stands. The 1991 Standards do not require  that public entities meet specific architectural standards with regard  to the construction and alteration of courtrooms and judicial  facilities. Because it is apparent that the judicial facilities of State  and local governments have often been inaccessible to individuals with  disabilities, as part of the NPRM, the Department proposed the adoption  of sections 206.2.4, 231.2, 808, 304, 305, and 902 of the 2004 ADAAG  concerning judicial facilities and courtrooms, including requirements  for accessible courtroom stations and accessible jury boxes and witness  stands.</p><p class="depth0">Those who commented on access to judicial facilities and courtrooms  uniformly favored the adoption of the 2010 Standards. Virtually all of  the commenters stated that accessible judicial facilities are crucial to  ensuring that individuals with disabilities are afforded due process  under law and have an equal opportunity to participate in the judicial  process. None of the commenters favored returning this requirement to  the Access Board for further consideration.</p><p class="depth0">The majority of commenters, including many disability rights and  advocacy organizations, stated that it is crucial for individuals with  disabilities to have effective and meaningful access to our judicial  system so as to afford them due process under law. They objected to  asking the Access Board to reconsider this requirement. In addition to  criticizing the initial RIA for virtually ignoring the intangible and  non-monetary benefits associated with accessible courtrooms, these  commenters frequently cited the Supreme Court's decision in Tennessee v.  Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 531 (2004),\4\ as ample justification for the  requirement, noting the Court's finding that ``[t]he unequal treatment  of disabled persons in the administration of judicial services has a  long history, and has persisted despite several legislative efforts to  remedy the problem of disability discrimination.'' Id. at 531. These  commenters also made a number of observations, including the following:  providing effective access to individuals with mobility impairments is  not possible when architectural barriers impede their path of travel and  negatively emphasize an individual's disability; the perception  generated by makeshift accommodations discredits witnesses and attorneys  with disabilities, who should not be stigmatized or treated like second- class citizens; the cost of accessibility modifications to existing  courthouses can often be significantly decreased by planning ahead, by  focusing on low-cost options that provide effective access, and by  addressing existing barriers when reasonable modifications to the  courtroom can be made;   by planning ahead and by following best practices, jurisdictions can  avoid those situations where it is apparent that someone's disability is  the reason why ad hoc arrangements have to be made prior to the  beginning of court proceedings; and accessibility should be a key  concern during the planning and construction process so as to ensure  that both courtroom grandeur and accessibility are achieved. One  commenter stated that, in order for attorneys with disabilities to  perform their professional duties to their clients and the court, it is  essential that accessible courtrooms, conference rooms, law libraries,  judicial chambers, and other areas of a courthouse be made barrier-free  by taking accessible design into account prior to construction. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ The Supreme Court in Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 533-534  (2004), held that title II of the ADA constitutes a valid exercise of  Congress' enforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment in cases  implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Numerous commenters identified a variety of benefits that would  accrue as a result of requiring judicial facilities to be accessible.  These included the following: maintaining the decorum of the courtroom  and eliminating the disruption of court proceedings when individuals  confront physical barriers; providing an accessible route to the witness  stand and attorney area and clear floor space to accommodate a  wheelchair within the witness area; establishing crucial lines of sight  between the judge, jury, witnesses, and attorneys--which commenters  described as crucial; ensuring that the judge and the jury will not miss  key visual indicators of a witness; maintaining a witness's or  attorney's dignity and credibility; shifting the focus from a witness's  disability to the substance of that person's testimony; fostering the  independence of an individual with disability; allowing persons with  mobility impairments to testify as witnesses, including as expert  witnesses; ensuring the safety of various participants in a courtroom  proceeding; and avoiding unlawful discrimination. One commenter stated  that equal access to the well of the courtroom for both attorney and  client is important for equal participation and representation in our  court system. Other commenters indicated that accessible judicial  facilities benefit a wide range of people, including many persons  without disabilities, senior citizens, parents using strollers with  small children, and attorneys and court personnel wheeling documents  into the courtroom. One commenter urged the adoption of the work area  provisions because they would result in better workplace accessibility  and increased productivity. Several commenters urged the adoption of the  rule because it harmonizes the ADAAG with the model IBC, the standards  developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and model  codes that have been widely adopted by State and local building  departments, thus increasing the prospects for better understanding and  compliance with the ADAAG by architects, designers, and builders.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters mentioned the report ``Justice for All: Designing  Accessible Courthouses'' (Nov. 15, 2006), available at http:// www.access-board.gov/caac/report.htm (Nov. 24, 2009) (last visited June  24, 2010). The report, prepared by the Courthouse Access Advisory  Committee for the Access Board, contained recommendations for the  Board's use in developing and disseminating guidance on accessible  courthouse design under the ADA and the ABA. These commenters identified  some of the report's best practices concerning courtroom accessibility  for witness stands, jury boxes, and attorney areas; addressed the costs  and benefits arising from the use of accessible courtrooms; and  recommended that the report be incorporated into the Department's final  rule. With respect to existing courtrooms, one commenter in this group  suggested that consideration be given to ensuring that there are  barrier-free emergency evacuation routes for all persons in the  courtroom, including different evacuation routes for different classes  of individuals given the unique nature of judicial facilities and  courtrooms.</p><p class="depth0">The Department declines to incorporate the report into the  regulation. However, the Department encourages State and local  governments to consult the Committee report as a useful guide on ways to  facilitate and increase accessibility of their judicial facilities. The  report includes many excellent examples of accessible courtroom design.</p><p class="depth0">One commenter proposed that the regulation also require a sufficient  number of accessible benches for judges with disabilities. Under section  206.2.4 of the 2004 ADAAG, raised courtroom stations used by judges and  other judicial staff are not required to provide full vertical access  when first constructed or altered, as long as the required clear floor  space, maneuvering space, and any necessary electrical service for  future installation of a means of vertical access, is provided at the  time of new construction or can be achieved without substantial  reconstruction during alterations. The Department believes that this  standard easily allows a courtroom station to be adapted to provide  vertical access in the event a judge requires an accessible judge's  bench.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received several anecdotal accounts of courtroom  experiences of individuals with disabilities. One commenter recalled  numerous difficulties that her law partner faced as the result of  inaccessible courtrooms, and their concerns that the attention of judge  and jury was directed away from the merits of case to the lawyer and his  disability. Among other things, the lawyer had to ask the judges on an  appellate panel to wait while he maneuvered through insufficient space  to the counsel table; ask judges to relocate bench conferences to  accessible areas; and make last-minute preparations and rearrangements  that his peers without   disabilities did not have to make. Another commenter with extensive  experience as a lawyer, witness, juror, and consultant observed that it  is common practice for a witness who uses mobility devices to sit in  front of the witness stand. He described how disconcerting and  unsettling it has been for him to testify in front of the witness stand,  which allowed individuals in the courtroom to see his hands or legs  shaking because of spasticity, making him feel like a second-class  citizen.</p><p class="depth0">Two other commenters with mobility disabilities described their  experiences testifying in court. One accessibility consultant stated  that she was able to represent her clients successfully when she had  access to an accessible witness stand because it gave her the ability  ``to look the judge in the eye, speak comfortably and be heard, hold up  visual aids that could be seen by the judge, and perform without an  architectural stigma.'' She did not believe that she was able to achieve  a comparable outcome or have meaningful access to the justice system  when she testified from an inaccessible location. Similarly, a licensed  clinical social worker indicated that she has testified in several cases  in accessible courtrooms, and that having full access to the witness  stand in the presence of the judge and the jury was important to her  effectiveness as an expert witness. She noted that accessible courtrooms  often are not available, and that she was aware of instances in which  victims, witnesses, and attorneys with disabilities have not been able  to obtain needed disability accommodations in order to fulfill their  roles at trial.</p><p class="depth0">Two other commenters indicated that they had been chosen for jury  duty but that they were effectively denied their right to participate as  jurors because the courtrooms were not accessible. Another commenter  indicated that he has had to sit apart from the other jurors because the  jury box was inaccessible.</p><p class="depth0">A number of commenters expressed approval of actions taken by States  to facilitate access in judicial facilities. A member of a State  commission on disability noted that the State had been working toward  full accessibility since 1997 when the Uniform Building Code required  interior accessible routes. This commenter stated that the State's  district courts had been renovated to the maximum extent feasible to  provide greater access. This commenter also noted that a combination of  Community Development Block Grant money and State funds are often  awarded for renovations of courtroom areas. One advocacy group that has  dealt with court access issues stated that members of the State legal  community and disability advocates have long been promoting efforts to  ensure that the State courts are accessible to individuals with  disabilities. The comment cited a publication distributed to the  Washington State courts by the State bar association entitled,  ``Ensuring Equal Access to the Courts for Persons with Disabilities.''  (Aug. 2006), available at http://www.wsba.org/ ensuringaccessguidebook.pdf (last visited July 20, 2010). In addition,  the commenter also indicated that the State supreme court had  promulgated a new rule governing how the courts should respond to  requests of accommodation based upon disability; the State legislature  had created the position of Disability Access Coordinator for Courts to  facilitate accessibility in the court system; and the State legislature  had passed a law requiring that all planned improvements and alterations  to historic courthouses be approved by the ADA State facilities program  manager and committee in order to ensure that the alterations will  enhance accessibility.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has decided to adopt the requirements in the 2004  ADAAG with respect to judicial facilities and courtrooms and will not  ask the Access Board to review these requirements. The final rule is  wholly consistent with the objectives of the ADA. It addresses a well- documented history of discrimination with respect to judicial  administration and significantly increases accessibility for individuals  with disabilities. It helps ensure that they will have an opportunity to  participate equally in the judicial process. As stated, the final rule  is consistent with a number of model and local building codes that have  been widely adopted by State and local building departments and provides  greater uniformity for planners, architects, and builders.</p><p class="depth0">Assistive listening systems. The 1991 Standards at sections 4.33.6  and 4.33.7 require assistive listening systems (ALS) in assembly areas  and prescribe general performance standards for ALS systems. In the  NPRM, the Department proposed adopting the technical specifications in  the 2004 ADAAG for ALS that are intended to ensure better quality and  effective delivery of sound and information for persons with hearing  impairments, especially those using hearing aids. The Department noted  in the NPRM that since 1991, advancements in ALS and the advent of  digital technology have made these systems more amenable to uniform  standards, which, among other things, should ensure that a certain  percentage of required ALS systems are hearing-aid compatible. 73 FR  34466, 34471 (June 17, 2008). The 2010 Standards at section 219 provide  scoping requirements and at section 706 address receiver jacks, hearing  aid compatibility, sound pressure level, signal-to-noise ratio, and peak  clipping level. The Department requested comments specifically from  arena and assembly area administrators on the cost and maintenance  issues associated with ALS, asked generally about the costs and   benefits of ALS, and asked whether, based upon the expected costs of  ALS, the issue should be returned to the Access Board for further  consideration.</p><p class="depth0">Comments from advocacy organizations noted that persons who develop  significant hearing loss often discontinue their normal routines and  activities, including meetings, entertainment, and large group events,  due to a sense of isolation caused by the hearing loss or embarrassment.  Individuals with longstanding hearing loss may never have participated  in group activities for many of the same reasons. Requiring ALS may  allow individuals with disabilities to contribute to the community by  joining in government and public events, and increasing economic  activity associated with community activities and entertainment. Making  public events and entertainment accessible to persons with hearing loss  also brings families and other groups that include persons with hearing  loss into more community events and activities, thus exponentially  increasing the benefit from ALS.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters noted that when a person has significant hearing  loss, that person may be able to hear and understand information in a  quiet situation with the use of hearing aids or cochlear implants;  however, as background noise increases and the distance between the  source of the sound and the listener grows, and especially where there  is distortion in the sound, an ALS becomes essential for basic  comprehension and understanding. Commenters noted that among the 31  million Americans with hearing loss, and with a projected increase to  over 78 million Americans with hearing loss by 2030, the benefit from  ALS is huge and growing. Advocates for persons with disabilities and  individuals commented that they appreciated the improvements in the 2004  ADAAG standards for ALS, including specifications for the ALS systems  and performance standards. They noted that neckloops that translate the  signal from the ALS transmitter to a frequency that can be heard on a  hearing aid or cochlear implant are much more effective than separate  ALS system headsets, which sometimes create feedback, often malfunction,  and may create distractions for others seated nearby. Comments from  advocates and users of ALS systems consistently noted that the  Department's regulation should, at a minimum, be consistent with the  2004 ADAAG. Although there were requests for adjustments in the scoping  requirements from advocates seeking increased scoping requirements, and  from large venue operators seeking fewer requirements, there was no  significant concern expressed by commenters about the technical  specifications for ALS in the 2004 ADAAG.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters from trade associations and large venue owners  criticized the scoping requirements as too onerous and one commenter  asked for a remand to the Access Board for new scoping rules. However,  one State agency commented that the 2004 ADAAG largely duplicates the  requirements in the 2006 IBC and the 2003 ANSI codes, which means that  entities that comply with those standards would not incur additional  costs associated with ADA compliance.</p><p class="depth0">According to one State office of the courts, the cost to install  either an infrared system or an FM system at average-sized facilities,  including most courtrooms covered by title II, would be between $500 and  $2,000, which the agency viewed as a small price in comparison to the  benefits of inclusion. Advocacy organizations estimated wholesale costs  of ALS systems at about $250 each and individual neckloops to link the  signal from the ALS transmitter to hearing aids or cochlear implants at  less than $50 per unit. Many commenters pointed out that if a facility  already is using induction neckloops, it would already be in compliance  and would not have any additional installation costs. One major city  commented that annual maintenance is about $2,000 for the entire system  of performance venues in the city. A trade association representing very  large venues estimated annual maintenance and upkeep expenses, including  labor and replacement parts, to be at most about $25,000 for a very  large professional sports stadium.</p><p class="depth0">One commenter suggested that the scoping requirements for ALS in the  2004 ADAAG were too stringent and that the Department should return them  to the Access Board for further review and consideration. Others  commented that the requirement for new ALS systems should mandate  multichannel receivers capable of receiving audio description for  persons who are blind, in addition to a channel for amplification for  persons who are hard of hearing. Some comments suggested that the  Department should require a set schedule and protocol of mandatory  maintenance. Department regulations already require maintenance of  accessible features at Sec.  35.133(a) of the title II regulation, which  obligates a title II entity to maintain ALS in good working order. The  Department recognizes that maintenance of ALS is key to its usability.  Necessary maintenance will vary dramatically from venue to venue based  upon a variety of factors including frequency of use, number of units,  quality of equipment, and others items. Accordingly, the Department has  determined that it is not appropriate to mandate details of maintenance,  but notes that failure to maintain ALS would violate Sec.  35.133(a) of  this rule.</p><p class="depth0">The NPRM asked whether the Department should return the issue of ALS  requirements to the Access Board. The Department has received  substantial feedback on the technical and scoping requirements for ALS  and is   convinced that these requirements are reasonable and that the benefits  justify the requirements. In addition, the Department believes that the  new specifications will make ALS work more effectively for more persons  with disabilities, which, together with a growing population of new  users, will increase demand for ALS, thus mooting criticism from some  large venue operators about insufficient demand. Thus, the Department  has determined that it is unnecessary to refer this issue back to the  Access Board for reconsideration.</p><p class="depth0">Accessible teeing grounds, putting greens, and weather shelters. In  the NPRM, the Department sought public input on the proposed  requirements for accessible golf courses. These requirements  specifically relate to accessible routes within the boundaries of  courses, as well as the accessibility of golfing elements (e.g., teeing  grounds, putting greens, weather shelters).</p><p class="depth0">In the NPRM, the Department sought information from the owners and  operators of golf courses, both public and private, on the extent to  which their courses already have golf car passages, and, if so, whether  they intended to avail themselves of the proposed accessible route  exception for golf car passages. 73 FR 34466, 34471 (June 17, 2008).</p><p class="depth0">Most commenters expressed support for the adoption of an accessible  route requirement that includes an exception permitting golf car passage  as all or part of an accessible route. Comments in favor of the proposed  standard came from golf course owners and operators, individuals,  organizations, and disability rights groups, while comments opposing  adoption of the golf course requirements generally came from golf  courses and organizations representing the golf course industry.</p><p class="depth0">The majority of commenters expressed the general viewpoint that  nearly all golf courses provide golf cars and have either well-defined  paths or permit golf cars to drive on the course where paths are not  present, thus meeting the accessible route requirement. Several  commenters disagreed with the assumption in the initial RIA, that  virtually every tee and putting green on an existing course would need  to be regraded in order to provide compliant accessible routes.  According to one commenter, many golf courses are relatively flat with  little slope, especially those heavily used by recreational golfers.  This commenter concurred with the Department that it is likely that most  existing golf courses have a golf car passage to tees and greens,  thereby substantially minimizing the cost of bringing an existing golf  course into compliance with the proposed standards. One commenter  reported that golf course access audits found that the vast majority of  public golf courses would have little difficulty in meeting the proposed  golf course requirements. In the view of some commenters, providing  access to golf courses would increase golf participation by individuals  with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">The Department also received many comments requesting clarification  of the term ``golf car passage.'' For example, one commenter requesting  clarification of the term ``golf car passage'' argued that golf courses  typically do not provide golf car paths or pedestrian paths onto the  actual teeing grounds or greens, many of which are higher or lower than  the car path. This commenter argued that if golf car passages were  required to extend onto teeing grounds and greens in order to qualify  for an exception, then some golf courses would have to substantially  regrade teeing grounds and greens at a high cost.</p><p class="depth0">After careful consideration of the comments, the Department has  decided to adopt the 2010 Standards specific to golf facilities. The  Department believes that in order for individuals with mobility  disabilities to have an opportunity to play golf that is equal to  golfers without disabilities, it is essential that golf courses provide  an accessible route or accessible golf car passage to connect accessible  elements and spaces within the boundary of the golf course, including  teeing grounds, putting greens, and weather shelters.</p><p class="depth0">Public Comments on Other NPRM Issues</p><p class="depth0">Equipment and furniture. In the 1991 title II regulation, there are  no specific provisions addressing equipment and furniture, although  Sec.  35.150(b) states that one means by which a public entity can make  its program accessible to individuals with disabilities is ``redesign of  equipment.'' In the NPRM, the Department announced its intention not to  regulate equipment, proposing instead to continue with the current  approach, under which equipment and furniture are covered by other  provisions, including those requiring reasonable modifications of  policies, practices, or procedures, program accessibility, and effective  communication. The Department suggested that entities apply the  accessibility standards for fixed equipment in the 2004 ADAAG to  analogous free-standing equipment in order to ensure that such equipment  is accessible, and that entities consult relevant portions of the 2004  ADAAG and standards from other Federal agencies to make equipment  accessible to individuals who are blind or have low vision (e.g., the  communication-related standards for ATMs in the 2004 ADAAG).</p><p class="depth0">The Department received numerous comments objecting to this decision  and urging the Department to issue equipment and furniture regulations.  Based on these comments, the Department has decided that it needs to  revisit the issuance of equipment and furniture regulations and it  intends to do so in future rulemaking.</p><p class="depth0">Among the commenters' key concerns, many from the disability  community and some public entities, were objections to the Department's  earlier decision not to issue equipment regulations, especially for  medical equipment. These groups recommended that the Department list by  name certain types of medical equipment that must be accessible,  including exam tables (that lower to 15 inches above floor or lower),  scales, medical and dental chairs, and radiologic equipment (including  mammography equipment). These commenters emphasized that the provision  of medically related equipment and furniture should also be specifically  regulated since they are not included in the 2004 ADAAG (while  depositories, change machines, fuel dispensers, and ATMs were) and  because of their crucial role in the provision of healthcare. Commenters  described how the lack of accessible medical equipment negatively  affects the health of individuals with disabilities. For example, some  individuals with mobility disabilities do not get thorough medical care  because their health providers do not have accessible examination tables  or scales.</p><p class="depth0">Commenters also said that the Department's stated plan to assess the  financial impact of free-standing equipment on businesses was not  necessary, as any regulations could include a financial balancing test.  Other commenters representing persons who are blind or have low vision  urged the Department to mandate accessibility for a wide range of  equipment--including household appliances (stoves, washers, microwaves,  and coffee makers), audiovisual equipment (stereos and DVD players),  exercise machines, vending equipment, ATMs, computers at Internet cafes  or hotel business centers, reservations kiosks at hotels, and point-of- sale devices--through speech output and tactile labels and controls.  They argued that modern technology allows such equipment to be made  accessible at minimal cost. According to these commenters, the lack of  such accessibility in point-of-sale devices is particularly problematic  because it forces blind individuals to provide personal or sensitive  information (such as personal identification numbers) to third parties,  which exposes them to identity fraud. Because the ADA does not apply  directly to the manufacture of products, the Department lacks the  authority to issue design requirements for equipment designed  exclusively for use in private homes. See Department of Justice,  Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA Title III Technical Assistance  Manual Covering Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities, III- 4.4200, available at http://www.ada.gov/taman3.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters urged the Department to require swimming pool  operators to provide aquatic wheelchairs for the use of persons with  disabilities when the swimming pool has a sloped entry. If there is a  sloped entry, a person who uses a wheelchair would require a wheelchair  designed for use in the water in order to gain access to the pool  because taking a personal wheelchair into water would rust and corrode  the metal on the chair and damage any electrical components of a power  wheelchair. Providing an aquatic wheelchair made of non-corrosive  materials and designed for access into the water will protect the water  from contamination and avoid damage to personal wheelchairs or other  mobility aids.</p><p class="depth0">Additionally, many commenters urged the Department to regulate the  height of beds in accessible hotel guest rooms and to ensure that such  beds have clearance at the floor to accommodate a mechanical lift. These  commenters noted that in recent years, hotel beds have become higher as  hotels use thicker mattresses, thereby making it difficult or impossible  for many individuals who use wheelchairs to transfer onto hotel beds. In  addition, many hotel beds use a solid-sided platform base with no  clearance at the floor, which prevents the use of a portable lift to  transfer an individual onto the bed. Consequently, individuals who bring  their own lift to transfer onto the bed cannot independently get  themselves onto the bed. Some commenters suggested various design  options that might avoid these situations.</p><p class="depth0">The Department intends to provide specific guidance relating to both  hotel beds and aquatic wheelchairs in a future rulemaking. For the  present, the Department reminds covered entities that they have an  obligation to undertake reasonable modifications to their current  policies and to make their programs accessible to persons with  disabilities. In many cases, providing aquatic wheelchairs or adjusting  hotel bed heights may be necessary to comply with those requirements.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has decided not to add specific scoping or technical  requirements for equipment and furniture in this final rule. Other  provisions of the regulation, including those requiring reasonable  modifications of policies, practices, or procedures, program  accessibility, and effective communication may require the provision of  accessible equipment in individual circumstances. The 1991 title II  regulation at Sec.  35.150(a) requires that entities operate each  service, program, or activity so that, when viewed in its entirety, each  is readily accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities,  subject to a defense of fundamental alteration or undue financial and  administrative burdens. Section 35.150(b) specifies that such entities  may meet their program accessibility obligation through the ``redesign  of equipment.'' The Department expects to undertake a rulemaking to  address these issues in the near future.</p><p class="depth0">Accessible golf cars. An accessible golf car means a device that is  designed and manufactured to be driven on all areas of a golf course, is  independently usable by individuals with mobility disabilities, has a  hand-operated brake and accelerator, carries golf clubs in an accessible  location, and has a seat that both swivels and raises to put the golfer  in a standing or semi-standing position.</p><p class="depth0">The 1991 title II regulation contained no language specifically  referencing accessible golf cars. After considering the comments  addressing the ANPRM's proposed requirement that golf courses make at  least one specialized golf car available for the use of individuals with  disabilities, and the safety of accessible golf cars and their use on  golf course greens, the Department stated in the NPRM that it would not  issue regulations specific to golf cars.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received many comments in response to its decision to  propose no new regulation specific to accessible golf cars. The majority  of commenters urged the Department to require golf courses to provide  accessible golf cars. These comments came from individuals, disability  advocacy and recreation groups, a manufacturer of accessible golf cars,  and representatives of local government. Comments supporting the  Department's decision not to propose a new regulation came from golf  course owners, associations, and individuals.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters argued that while the existing title II regulation  covered the issue, the Department should nonetheless adopt specific  regulatory language requiring golf courses to provide accessible golf  cars. Some commenters noted that many local governments and park  authorities that operate public golf courses have already provided  accessible golf cars. Experience indicates that such golf cars may be  used without damaging courses. Some argued that having accessible golf  cars would increase golf course revenue by enabling more golfers with  disabilities to play the game. Several commenters requested that the  Department adopt a regulation specifically requiring each golf course to  provide one or more accessible golf cars. Other commenters recommended  allowing golf courses to make ``pooling'' arrangements to meet demands  for such cars. A few commenters expressed support for using accessible  golf cars to accommodate golfers with and without disabilities.  Commenters also pointed out that the Departments of the Interior and  Defense have already mandated that golf courses under their  jurisdictional control must make accessible golf cars available unless  it can be demonstrated that doing so would change the fundamental nature  of the game.</p><p class="depth0">While an industry association argued that at least two models of  accessible golf cars meet the specifications recognized in the field,  and that accessible golf cars cause no more damage to greens or other  parts of golf courses than players standing or walking across the  course, other commenters expressed concerns about the potential for  damage associated with the use of accessible golf cars. Citing safety  concerns, golf organizations recommended that an industry safety  standard be developed.</p><p class="depth0">Although the Department declines to add specific scoping or  technical requirements for golf cars to this final rule, the Department  expects to address requirements for accessible golf cars in future  rulemaking. In the meantime, the Department believes that golfers with  disabilities who need accessible golf cars are protected by other  existing provisions in the title II regulation, including those  requiring reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or  procedures, and program accessibility.</p><p class="depth0">Web site accessibility. Many commenters expressed disappointment  that the NPRM did not require title II entities to make their Web sites,  through which they offer programs and services, accessible to  individuals with disabilities, including those who are blind or have low  vision. Commenters argued that the cost of making Web sites accessible,  through Web site design, is minimal, yet critical to enabling  individuals with disabilities to benefit from the entity's programs and  services. Internet Web sites, when accessible, provide individuals with  disabilities great independence, and have become an essential tool for  many Americans. Commenters recommended that the Department require  covered entities, at a minimum, to meet the section 508 Standard for  Electronic and Information Technology for Internet accessibility. Under  section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Federal agencies are  required to make their Web sites accessible. 29 U.S.C. 794(d); 36 CFR  1194.</p><p class="depth0">The Department agrees that the ability to access, on an equal basis,  the programs and activities offered by public entities through Internet- based Web sites is of great importance to individuals with disabilities,  particularly those who are blind or who have low vision. When the ADA  was enacted in 1990, the Internet was unknown to most Americans. Today,  the Internet plays a critical role in daily life for personal, civic,  commercial, and business purposes. In a period of shrinking resources,  public entities increasingly rely on the web as an efficient and  comprehensive way to deliver services and to inform and communicate with  their citizens and the general public. In light of the growing  importance Web sites play in providing access to public services and to  disseminating the information citizens need to participate fully in  civic life, accessing the Web sites of public entities can play a  significant role in fulfilling the goals of the ADA.</p><p class="depth0">Although the language of the ADA does not explicitly mention the  Internet, the Department has taken the position that title II covers  Internet Web site access. Public entities that choose to provide  services through web-based applications (e.g., renewing library books or  driver's licenses) or that communicate with their constituents or  provide information through the Internet must ensure that individuals  with disabilities have equal access to such services or information,  unless doing so would result in an undue financial and administrative  burden or a fundamental alteration in the nature of the programs,  services, or activities being offered. The Department has issued  guidance on the ADA as applied to the Web sites of public entities in a  2003 publication entitled, Accessibility of State and Local Government  Web sites to People with Disabilities, (June 2003) available at http:// www.ada.gov/websites2.htm. As the Department stated in that publication,  an agency with an inaccessible Web site may also meet its legal  obligations by providing an alternative accessible way for citizens to  use the programs or services, such as a staffed telephone information  line. However, such an alternative must provide an equal degree of  access in terms of hours of operation and the range of options and  programs available. For example, if job announcements and application  forms are posted on an inaccessible Web site that is available 24 hours  a day, seven days a week to individuals without disabilities, then the  alternative accessible method must also be available 24 hours a day, 7  days a week. Additional guidance is available in the Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), (May 5, 1999) available at http:// www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT (last visited June 24, 2010) which are  developed and maintained by the Web Accessibility Initiative, a subgroup  of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C[supreg]).</p><p class="depth0">The Department expects to engage in rulemaking relating to website  accessibility under the ADA in the near future. The Department has  enforced the ADA in the area of website accessibility on a case-by-case  basis under existing rules consistent with the guidance noted above, and  will continue to do so until the issue is addressed in a final  regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Multiple chemical sensitivities. The Department received comments  from a number of individuals asking the Department to add specific  language to the final rule addressing the needs of individuals with  chemical sensitivities. These commenters expressed concern that the  presence of chemicals interferes with their ability to participate in a  wide range of activities. These commenters also urged the Department to  add multiple chemical sensitivities to the definition of a disability.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has determined not to include specific provisions  addressing multiple chemical sensitivities in the final rule. In order  to be viewed as a disability under the ADA, an impairment must  substantially limit one or more major life activities. An individual's  major life activities of respiratory or neurological functioning may be  substantially limited by allergies or sensitivity to a degree that he or  she is a person with a disability. When a person has this type of  disability, a covered entity may have to make reasonable modifications  in its policies and practices for that person. However, this  determination is an individual assessment and must be made on a case-by- case basis.</p><p class="depth0">Examinations and Courses. The Department received one comment  requesting that it specifically include language regarding examinations  and courses in the title II regulation. Because section 309 of the ADA  42 U.S.C. 12189, reaches ``[a]ny person that offers examinations or  courses related to applications, licensing, certification, or  credentialing for secondary or post secondary education, professional,  or trade purposes,'' public entities also are covered by this section of  the ADA. Indeed, the requirements contained in title II (including the  general prohibitions against discrimination, the program access  requirements, the reasonable modifications requirements, and the  communications requirements) apply to courses and examinations  administered by public entities that meet the requirements of section  309. While the Department considers these requirements to be sufficient  to ensure that examinations and courses administered by public entities  meet the section 309 requirements, the Department acknowledges that the  title III regulation, because it addresses examinations in some detail,  is useful as a guide for determining what constitutes discriminatory  conduct by a public entity in testing situations. See 28 CFR 36.309.</p><p class="depth0">Hotel Reservations. In the NPRM, at Sec.  36.302(e), the Department  proposed adding specific language to title III addressing the  requirements that hotels, timeshare resorts, and other places of lodging  make reasonable modifications to their policies, practices, or  procedures, when necessary to ensure that individuals with disabilities  are able to reserve accessible hotel rooms with the same efficiency,  immediacy, and convenience as those who do not need accessible guest  rooms. The NPRM did not propose adding comparable language to the title  II regulation as the Department believes that the general  nondiscrimination, program access, effective communication, and  reasonable modifications requirements of title II provide sufficient  guidance to public entities that operate places of lodging (i.e., lodges  in State parks, hotels on public college campuses). The Department  received no public comments suggesting that it add language   on hotel reservations comparable to that proposed for the title III  regulation. Although the Department continues to believe that it is  unnecessary to add specific language to the title II regulation on this  issue, the Department acknowledges that the title III regulation,  because it addresses hotel reservations in some detail, is useful as a  guide for determining what constitutes discriminatory conduct by a  public entity that operates a reservation system serving a place of  lodging.See 28 CFR 36.302(e).  [AG Order No. 3180-2010, 75 FR 56184, Sept. 15, 2010; 76 FR 13285, Mar.  11, 2011]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix B to Part 35--Guidance on ADA Regulation on</p><p class="depth0">Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in State and Local</p><p class="depth0">Government Services Originally Published July 26, 1991</p><p class="depth0">Note: For the convenience of the reader, this appendix contains the  text of the preamble to the final regulation on nondiscrimination on the  basis of disability in State and local government services beginning at  the heading ``Section-by-Section Analysis'' and ending before ``List of  Subjects in 28 CFR Part 35'' (56 FR 35696, July 26, 1991).</p><p class="depth0">Section-by-Section Analysis</p><p class="depth0">Subpart A--General</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.101 Purpose</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.101 states the purpose of the rule, which is to  effectuate subtitle A of title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act  of 1990 (the Act), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of  disability by public entities. This part does not, however, apply to  matters within the scope of the authority of the Secretary of  Transportation under subtitle B of title II of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.102 Application</p><p class="depth0">This provision specifies that, except as provided in paragraph (b),  the regulation applies to all services, programs, and activities  provided or made available by public entities, as that term is defined  in Sec.  35.104. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29  U.S.C. 794), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in  federally assisted programs and activities, already covers those  programs and activities of public entities that receive Federal  financial assistance. Title II of the ADA extends this prohibition of  discrimination to include all services, programs, and activities  provided or made available by State and local governments or any of  their instrumentalities or agencies, regardless of the receipt of  Federal financial assistance. Except as provided in Sec.  35.l34, this  part does not apply to private entities.</p><p class="depth0">The scope of title II's coverage of public entities is comparable to  the coverage of Federal Executive agencies under the 1978 amendment to  section 504, which extended section 504's application to all programs  and activities ``conducted by'' Federal Executive agencies, in that  title II applies to anything a public entity does. Title II coverage,  however, is not limited to ``Executive'' agencies, but includes  activities of the legislative and judicial branches of State and local  governments. All governmental activities of public entities are covered,  even if they are carried out by contractors. For example, a State is  obligated by title II to ensure that the services, programs, and  activities of a State park inn operated under contract by a private  entity are in compliance with title II's requirements. The private  entity operating the inn would also be subject to the obligations of  public accommodations under title III of the Act and the Department's  title III regulations at 28 CFR part 36.</p><p class="depth0">Aside from employment, which is also covered by title I of the Act,  there are two major categories of programs or activities covered by this  regulation: those involving general public contact as part of ongoing  operations of the entity and those directly administered by the entities  for program beneficiaries and participants. Activities in the first  category include communication with the public (telephone contacts,  office walk-ins, or interviews) and the public's use of the entity's  facilities. Activities in the second category include programs that  provide State or local government services or benefits.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b) of Sec.  35.102 explains that to the extent that the  public transportation services, programs, and activities of public  entities are covered by subtitle B of title II of the Act, they are  subject to the regulation of the Department of Transportation (DOT) at  49 CFR part 37, and are not covered by this part. The Department of  Transportation's ADA regulation establishes specific requirements for  construction of transportation facilities and acquisition of vehicles.  Matters not covered by subtitle B, such as the provision of auxiliary  aids, are covered by this rule. For example, activities that are covered  by the Department of Transportation's regulation implementing subtitle B  are not required to be included in the self-evaluation required by Sec.   35.105. In addition, activities not specifically addressed by DOT's ADA  regulation may be covered by DOT's regulation implementing section 504  for its federally assisted programs and activities at 49 CFR part 27.  Like other programs of public entities that are also recipients of  Federal financial assistance, those programs would be covered by both  the section 504 regulation and this part. Although   airports operated by public entities are not subject to DOT's ADA  regulation, they are subject to subpart A of title II and to this rule.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters asked for clarification about the responsibilities  of public school systems under section 504 and the ADA with respect to  programs, services, and activities that are not covered by the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), including, for  example, programs open to parents or to the public, graduation  ceremonies, parent-teacher organization meetings, plays and other events  open to the public, and adult education classes. Public school systems  must comply with the ADA in all of their services, programs, or  activities, including those that are open to parents or to the public.  For instance, public school systems must provide program accessibility  to parents and guardians with disabilities to these programs,  activities, or services, and appropriate auxiliary aids and services  whenever necessary to ensure effective communication, as long as the  provision of the auxiliary aids results neither in an undue burden or in  a fundamental alteration of the program.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.103 Relationship to Other Laws</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.103 is derived from sections 501 (a) and (b) of the ADA.  Paragraph (a) of this section provides that, except as otherwise  specifically provided by this part, title II of the ADA is not intended  to apply lesser standards than are required under title V of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 790-94), or the  regulations implementing that title. The standards of title V of the  Rehabilitation Act apply for purposes of the ADA to the extent that the  ADA has not explicitly adopted a different standard than title V.  Because title II of the ADA essentially extends the antidiscrimination  prohibition embodied in section 504 to all actions of State and local  governments, the standards adopted in this part are generally the same  as those required under section 504 for federally assisted programs.  Title II, however, also incorporates those provisions of titles I and  III of the ADA that are not inconsistent with the regulations  implementing section 504. Judiciary Committee report, H.R. Rep. No. 485,  101st Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 3, at 51 (1990) (hereinafter ``Judiciary  report'') ; Education and Labor Committee report, H.R. Rep. No. 485,  101st Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, at 84 (1990) (hereinafter ``Education and  Labor report''). Therefore, this part also includes appropriate  provisions derived from the regulations implementing those titles. The  inclusion of specific language in this part, however, should not be  interpreted as an indication that a requirement is not included under a  regulation implementing section 504.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b) makes clear that Congress did not intend to displace  any of the rights or remedies provided by other Federal laws (including  section 504) or other State laws (including State common law) that  provide greater or equal protection to individuals with disabilities. As  discussed above, the standards adopted by title II of the ADA for State  and local government services are generally the same as those required  under section 504 for federally assisted programs and activities.  Subpart F of the regulation establishes compliance procedures for  processing complaints covered by both this part and section 504.</p><p class="depth0">With respect to State law, a plaintiff may choose to pursue claims  under a State law that does not confer greater substantive rights, or  even confers fewer substantive rights, if the alleged violation is  protected under the alternative law and the remedies are greater. For  example, a person with a physical disability could seek damages under a  State law that allows compensatory and punitive damages for  discrimination on the basis of physical disability, but not on the basis  of mental disability. In that situation, the State law would provide  narrower coverage, by excluding mental disabilities, but broader  remedies, and an individual covered by both laws could choose to bring  an action under both laws. Moreover, State tort claims confer greater  remedies and are not preempted by the ADA. A plaintiff may join a State  tort claim to a case brought under the ADA. In such a case, the  plaintiff must, of course, prove all the elements of the State tort  claim in order to prevail under that cause of action.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.104 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">``Act.'' The word ``Act'' is used in this part to refer to the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Public Law 101-336, which is  also referred to as the ``ADA.''</p><p class="depth0">``Assistant Attorney General.'' The term ``Assistant Attorney  General'' refers to the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights  Division of the Department of Justice.</p><p class="depth0">``Auxiliary aids and services.'' Auxiliary aids and services include  a wide range of services and devices for ensuring effective  communication. The proposed definition in Sec.  35.104 provided a list  of examples of auxiliary aids and services that were taken from the  definition of auxiliary aids and services in section 3(1) of the ADA and  were supplemented by examples from regulations implementing section 504  in federally conducted programs (see 28 CFR 39.103).</p><p class="depth0">A substantial number of commenters suggested that additional  examples be added to this list. The Department has added several items  to this list but wishes to clarify that the list is not an all-inclusive  or exhaustive catalogue of possible or available auxiliary   aids or services. It is not possible to provide an exhaustive list, and  an attempt to do so would omit the new devices that will become  available with emerging technology.</p><p class="depth0">Subparagraph (1) lists several examples, which would be considered  auxiliary aids and services to make aurally delivered materials  available to individuals with hearing impairments. The Department has  changed the phrase used in the proposed rules, ``orally delivered  materials,'' to the statutory phrase, ``aurally delivered materials,''  to track section 3 of the ADA and to include non-verbal sounds and  alarms, and computer generated speech.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has added videotext displays, transcription services,  and closed and open captioning to the list of examples. Videotext  displays have become an important means of accessing auditory  communications through a public address system. Transcription services  are used to relay aurally delivered material almost simultaneously in  written form to persons who are deaf or hearing-impaired. This  technology is often used at conferences, conventions, and hearings.  While the proposed rule expressly included television decoder equipment  as an auxiliary aid or service, it did not mention captioning itself.  The final rule rectifies this omission by mentioning both closed and  open captioning.</p><p class="depth0">Several persons and organizations requested that the Department  replace the term ``telecommunications devices for deaf persons'' or  ``TDD's'' with the term ``text telephone.'' The Department has declined  to do so. The Department is aware that the Architectural and  Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB) has used the phrase  ``text telephone'' in lieu of the statutory term ``TDD'' in its final  accessibility guidelines. Title IV of the ADA, however, uses the term  ``Telecommunications Device for the Deaf'' and the Department believes  it would be inappropriate to abandon this statutory term at this time.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters urged the Department to include in the definition  of ``auxiliary aids and services'' devices that are now available or  that may become available with emerging technology. The Department  declines to do so in the rule. The Department, however, emphasizes that,  although the definition would include ``state of the art'' devices,  public entities are not required to use the newest or most advanced  technologies as long as the auxiliary aid or service that is selected  affords effective communication.</p><p class="depth0">Subparagraph (2) lists examples of aids and services for making  visually delivered materials accessible to persons with visual  impairments. Many commenters proposed additional examples, such as  signage or mapping, audio description services, secondary auditory  programs, telebraillers, and reading machines. While the Department  declines to add these items to the list, they are auxiliary aids and  services and may be appropriate depending on the circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">Subparagraph (3) refers to acquisition or modification of equipment  or devices. Several commenters suggested the addition of current  technological innovations in microelectronics and computerized control  systems (e.g., voice recognition systems, automatic dialing telephones,  and infrared elevator and light control systems) to the list of  auxiliary aids. The Department interprets auxiliary aids and services as  those aids and services designed to provide effective communications,  i.e., making aurally and visually delivered information available to  persons with hearing, speech, and vision impairments. Methods of making  services, programs, or activities accessible to, or usable by,  individuals with mobility or manual dexterity impairments are addressed  by other sections of this part, including the provision for  modifications in policies, practices, or procedures (Sec.  35.130  (b)(7)).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(4) deals with other similar services and actions.  Several commenters asked for clarification that ``similar services and  actions'' include retrieving items from shelves, assistance in reaching  a marginally accessible seat, pushing a barrier aside in order to  provide an accessible route, or assistance in removing a sweater or  coat. While retrieving an item from a shelf might be an ``auxiliary aid  or service'' for a blind person who could not locate the item without  assistance, it might be a method of providing program access for a  person using a wheelchair who could not reach the shelf, or a reasonable  modification to a self-service policy for an individual who lacked the  ability to grasp the item. As explained above, auxiliary aids and  services are those aids and services required to provide effective  communications. Other forms of assistance are more appropriately  addressed by other provisions of the final rule.</p><p class="depth0">``Complete complaint.'' ``Complete complaint'' is defined to include  all the information necessary to enable the Federal agency designated  under subpart G as responsible for investigation of a complaint to  initiate its investigation.</p><p class="depth0">``Current illegal use of drugs.'' The phrase ``current illegal use  of drugs'' is used in Sec.  35.131. Its meaning is discussed in the  preamble for that section.</p><p class="depth0">``Designated agency.'' The term ``designated agency'' is used to  refer to the Federal agency designated under subpart G of this rule as  responsible for carrying out the administrative enforcement  responsibilities established by subpart F of the rule.</p><p class="depth0">``Disability.'' The definition of the term ``disability'' is the  same as the definition in the title III regulation codified at 28 CFR  part 36. It is comparable to the definition of   the term ``individual with handicaps'' in section 7(8) of the  Rehabilitation Act and section 802(h) of the Fair Housing Act. The  Education and Labor Committee report makes clear that the analysis of  the term ``individual with handicaps'' by the Department of Health,  Education, and Welfare (HEW) in its regulations implementing section 504  (42 FR 22685 (May 4, 1977)) and the analysis by the Department of  Housing and Urban Development in its regulation implementing the Fair  Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (54 FR 3232 (Jan. 23, 1989)) should also  apply fully to the term ``disability'' (Education and Labor report at  50).</p><p class="depth0">The use of the term ``disability'' instead of ``handicap'' and the  term ``individual with a disability'' instead of ``individual with  handicaps'' represents an effort by Congress to make use of up-to-date,  currently accepted terminology. As with racial and ethnic epithets, the  choice of terms to apply to a person with a disability is overlaid with  stereotypes, patronizing attitudes, and other emotional connotations.  Many individuals with disabilities, and organizations representing such  individuals, object to the use of such terms as ``handicapped person''  or ``the handicapped.'' In other recent legislation, Congress also  recognized this shift in terminology, e.g., by changing the name of the  National Council on the Handicapped to the National Council on  Disability (Pub. L. 100-630).</p><p class="depth0">In enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act, Congress concluded  that it was important for the current legislation to use terminology  most in line with the sensibilities of most Americans with disabilities.  No change in definition or substance is intended nor should one be  attributed to this change in phraseology.</p><p class="depth0">The term ``disability'' means, with respect to an individual--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or  more of the major life activities of such individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A record of such an impairment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Being regarded as having such an impairment. If an individual  meets any one of these three tests, he or she is considered to be an  individual with a disability for purposes of coverage under the  Americans with Disabilities Act.</p><p class="depth0">Congress adopted this same basic definition of ``disability,'' first  used in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and in the Fair Housing  Amendments Act of 1988, for a number of reasons. First, it has worked  well since it was adopted in 1974. Second, it would not be possible to  guarantee comprehensiveness by providing a list of specific  disabilities, especially because new disorders may be recognized in the  future, as they have since the definition was first established in 1974.  Test A--A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or</p><p class="depth0">more of the major life activities of such individual</p><p class="depth0">Physical or mental impairment. Under the first test, an individual  must have a physical or mental impairment. As explained in paragraph  (1)(i) of the definition, ``impairment'' means any physiological  disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss  affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological;  musculoskeletal; special sense organs (which would include speech organs  that are not respiratory such as vocal cords, soft palate, tongue,  etc.); respiratory, including speech organs; cardiovascular;  reproductive; digestive; genitourinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and  endocrine. It also means any mental or psychological disorder, such as  mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness,  and specific learning disabilities. This list closely tracks the one  used in the regulations for section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of  1973 (see, e.g., 45 CFR 84.3(j)(2)(i)).</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters asked that ``traumatic brain injury'' be added to  the list in paragraph (1)(i). Traumatic brain injury is already included  because it is a physiological condition affecting one of the listed body  systems, i.e., ``neurological.'' Therefore, it was unnecessary to add  the term to the regulation, which only provides representative examples  of physiological disorders.</p><p class="depth0">It is not possible to include a list of all the specific conditions,  contagious and noncontagious diseases, or infections that would  constitute physical or mental impairments because of the difficulty of  ensuring the comprehensiveness of such a list, particularly in light of  the fact that other conditions or disorders may be identified in the  future. However, the list of examples in paragraph (1)(ii) of the  definition includes: orthopedic, visual, speech and hearing impairments,  cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis,  cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness,  specific learning disabilities, HIV disease (symptomatic or  asymptomatic), tuberculosis, drug addiction, and alcoholism. The phrase  ``symptomatic or asymptomatic'' was inserted in the final rule after  ``HIV disease'' in response to commenters who suggested the  clarification was necessary.</p><p class="depth0">The examples of ``physical or mental impairments'' in paragraph  (1)(ii) are the same as those contained in many section 504 regulations,  except for the addition of the phrase ``contagious and noncontagious''  to describe the types of diseases and conditions included, and the  addition of ``HIV disease   (symptomatic or asymptomatic)'' and ``tuberculosis'' to the list of  examples. These additions are based on the committee reports, caselaw,  and official legal opinions interpreting section 504. In School Board of  Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987), a case involving an  individual with tuberculosis, the Supreme Court held that people with  contagious diseases are entitled to the protections afforded by section  504. Following the Arline decision, this Department's Office of Legal  Counsel issued a legal opinion that concluded that symptomatic HIV  disease is an impairment that substantially limits a major life  activity; therefore it has been included in the definition of disability  under this part. The opinion also concluded that asymptomatic HIV  disease is an impairment that substantially limits a major life  activity, either because of its actual effect on the individual with HIV  disease or because the reactions of other people to individuals with HIV  disease cause such individuals to be treated as though they are  disabled. See Memorandum from Douglas W. Kmiec, Acting Assistant  Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, to  Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr., Counsel to the President (Sept. 27, 1988),  reprinted in Hearings on S. 933, the Americans with Disabilities Act,  Before the Subcomm. on the Handicapped of the Senate Comm. on Labor and  Human Resources, 101st. Cong., 1st Sess. 346 (1989).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (1)(iii) states that the phrase ``physical or mental  impairment'' does not include homosexuality or bisexuality. These  conditions were never considered impairments under other Federal  disability laws. Section 511(a) of the statute makes clear that they are  likewise not to be considered impairments under the Americans with  Disabilities Act.</p><p class="depth0">Physical or mental impairment does not include simple physical  characteristics, such as blue eyes or black hair. Nor does it include  environmental, cultural, economic, or other disadvantages, such as  having a prison record, or being poor. Nor is age a disability.  Similarly, the definition does not include common personality traits  such as poor judgment or a quick temper where these are not symptoms of  a mental or psychological disorder. However, a person who has these  characteristics and also has a physical or mental impairment may be  considered as having a disability for purposes of the Americans with  Disabilities Act based on the impairment.</p><p class="depth0">Substantial Limitation of a Major Life Activity. Under Test A, the  impairment must be one that ``substantially limits a major life  activity.'' Major life activities include such things as caring for  one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking,  breathing, learning, and working.</p><p class="depth0">For example, a person who is paraplegic is substantially limited in  the major life activity of walking, a person who is blind is  substantially limited in the major life activity of seeing, and a person  who is mentally retarded is substantially limited in the major life  activity of learning. A person with traumatic brain injury is  substantially limited in the major life activities of caring for one's  self, learning, and working because of memory deficit, confusion,  contextual difficulties, and inability to reason appropriately.</p><p class="depth0">A person is considered an individual with a disability for purposes  of Test A, the first prong of the definition, when the individual's  important life activities are restricted as to the conditions, manner,  or duration under which they can be performed in comparison to most  people. A person with a minor, trivial impairment, such as a simple  infected finger, is not impaired in a major life activity. A person who  can walk for 10 miles continuously is not substantially limited in  walking merely because, on the eleventh mile, he or she begins to  experience pain, because most people would not be able to walk eleven  miles without experiencing some discomfort.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received many comments on the proposed rule's  inclusion of the word ``temporary'' in the definition of ``disability.''  The preamble indicated that impairments are not necessarily excluded  from the definition of ``disability'' simply because they are temporary,  but that the duration, or expected duration, of an impairment is one  factor that may properly be considered in determining whether the  impairment substantially limits a major life activity. The preamble  recognized, however, that temporary impairments, such as a broken leg,  are not commonly regarded as disabilities, and only in rare  circumstances would the degree of the limitation and its expected  duration be substantial. Nevertheless, many commenters objected to  inclusion of the word ``temporary'' both because it is not in the  statute and because it is not contained in the definition of  ``disability'' set forth in the title I regulations of the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The word ``temporary'' has  been deleted from the final rule to conform with the statutory language.</p><p class="depth0">The question of whether a temporary impairment is a disability must  be resolved on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration both the  duration (or expected duration) of the impairment and the extent to  which it actually limits a major life activity of the affected  individual.</p><p class="depth0">The question of whether a person has a disability should be assessed  without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, such as  reasonable modification or auxiliary aids and services. For example, a  person with hearing loss is substantially limited in the major life  activity of hearing, even though   the loss may be improved through the use of a hearing aid. Likewise,  persons with impairments, such as epilepsy or diabetes, that  substantially limit a major life activity, are covered under the first  prong of the definition of disability, even if the effects of the  impairment are controlled by medication.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters asked that environmental illness (also known as  multiple chemical sensitivity) as well as allergy to cigarette smoke be  recognized as disabilities. The Department, however, declines to state  categorically that these types of allergies or sensitivities are  disabilities, because the determination as to whether an impairment is a  disability depends on whether, given the particular circumstances at  issue, the impairment substantially limits one or more major life  activities (or has a history of, or is regarded as having such an  effect).</p><p class="depth0">Sometimes respiratory or neurological functioning is so severely  affected that an individual will satisfy the requirements to be  considered disabled under the regulation. Such an individual would be  entitled to all of the protections afforded by the Act and this part. In  other cases, individuals may be sensitive to environmental elements or  to smoke but their sensitivity will not rise to the level needed to  constitute a disability. For example, their major life activity of  breathing may be somewhat, but not substantially, impaired. In such  circumstances, the individuals are not disabled and are not entitled to  the protections of the statute despite their sensitivity to  environmental agents.</p><p class="depth0">In sum, the determination as to whether allergies to cigarette  smoke, or allergies or sensitivities characterized by the commenters as  environmental illness are disabilities covered by the regulation must be  made using the same case-by-case analysis that is applied to all other  physical or mental impairments. Moreover, the addition of specific  regulatory provisions relating to environmental illness in the final  rule would be inappropriate at this time pending future consideration of  the issue by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance  Board, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Occupational Safety  and Health Administration of the Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth0">Test B--A record of such an impairment</p><p class="depth0">This test is intended to cover those who have a record of an  impairment. As explained in paragraph (3) of the rule's definition of  disability, this includes a person who has a history of an impairment  that substantially limited a major life activity, such as someone who  has recovered from an impairment. It also includes persons who have been  misclassified as having an impairment.</p><p class="depth0">This provision is included in the definition in part to protect  individuals who have recovered from a physical or mental impairment that  previously substantially limited them in a major life activity.  Discrimination on the basis of such a past impairment is prohibited.  Frequently occurring examples of the first group (those who have a  history of an impairment) are persons with histories of mental or  emotional illness, heart disease, or cancer; examples of the second  group (those who have been misclassified as having an impairment) are  persons who have been misclassified as having mental retardation or  mental illness.</p><p class="depth0">Test C--Being regarded as having such an impairment</p><p class="depth0">This test, as contained in paragraph (4) of the definition, is  intended to cover persons who are treated by a public entity as having a  physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life  activity. It applies when a person is treated as if he or she has an  impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, regardless  of whether that person has an impairment.</p><p class="depth0">The Americans with Disabilities Act uses the same ``regarded as''  test set forth in the regulations implementing section 504 of the  Rehabilitation Act. See, e.g., 28 CFR 42.540(k)(2)(iv), which provides:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> ``Is regarded as having an impairment'' means (A) Has a  physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major  life activities but that is treated by a recipient as constituting such  a limitation; (B) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially  limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others  toward such impairment; or (C) Has none of the impairments defined in  paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section but is treated by a recipient as  having such an impairment.</p><p class="depth0">The perception of the covered entity is a key element of this test.  A person who perceives himself or herself to have an impairment, but  does not have an impairment, and is not treated as if he or she has an  impairment, is not protected under this test.</p><p class="depth0">A person would be covered under this test if a public entity refused  to serve the person because it perceived that the person had an  impairment that limited his or her enjoyment of the goods or services  being offered.</p><p class="depth0">For example, persons with severe burns often encounter  discrimination in community activities, resulting in substantial  limitation of major life activities. These persons would be covered  under this test based on the attitudes of others towards the impairment,  even if they did not view themselves as ``impaired.''</p><p class="depth0">The rationale for this third test, as used in the Rehabilitation Act  of 1973, was articulated by the Supreme Court in Arline, 480 U.S. 273  (1987). The Court noted that although an individual may have an  impairment that does not in fact substantially limit a major life  activity, the reaction of   others may prove just as disabling. ``Such an impairment might not  diminish a person's physical or mental capabilities, but could  nevertheless substantially limit that person's ability to work as a  result of the negative reactions of others to the impairment.'' Id. at  283. The Court concluded that, by including this test in the  Rehabilitation Act's definition, ``Congress acknowledged that society's  accumulated myths and fears about disability and diseases are as  handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual  impairment.'' Id. at 284.</p><p class="depth0">Thus, a person who is denied services or benefits by a public entity  because of myths, fears, and stereotypes associated with disabilities  would be covered under this third test whether or not the person's  physical or mental condition would be considered a disability under the  first or second test in the definition.</p><p class="depth0">If a person is refused admittance on the basis of an actual or  perceived physical or mental condition, and the public entity can  articulate no legitimate reason for the refusal (such as failure to meet  eligibility criteria), a perceived concern about admitting persons with  disabilities could be inferred and the individual would qualify for  coverage under the ``regarded as'' test. A person who is covered because  of being regarded as having an impairment is not required to show that  the public entity's perception is inaccurate (e.g., that he will be  accepted by others) in order to receive benefits from the public entity.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (5) of the definition lists certain conditions that are  not included within the definition of ``disability.'' The excluded  conditions are: Transvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism,  voyeurism, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical  impairments, other sexual behavior disorders, compulsive gambling,  kleptomania, pyromania, and psychoactive substance use disorders  resulting from current illegal use of drugs. Unlike homosexuality and  bisexuality, which are not considered impairments under either section  504 or the Americans with Disabilities Act (see the definition of  ``disability,'' paragraph (1)(iv)), the conditions listed in paragraph  (5), except for transvestism, are not necessarily excluded as  impairments under section 504. (Transvestism was excluded from the  definition of disability for section 504 by the Fair Housing Amendments  Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-430, section 6(b)).</p><p class="depth0">``Drug.'' The definition of the term ``drug'' is taken from section  510(d)(2) of the ADA.</p><p class="depth0">``Facility.'' ``Facility'' means all or any portion of buildings,  structures, sites, complexes, equipment, rolling stock or other  conveyances, roads, walks, passageways, parking lots, or other real or  personal property, including the site where the building, property,  structure, or equipment is located. It includes both indoor and outdoor  areas where human-constructed improvements, structures, equipment, or  property have been added to the natural environment.</p><p class="depth0">Commenters raised questions about the applicability of this part to  activities operated in mobile facilities, such as bookmobiles or mobile  health screening units. Such activities would be covered by the  requirement for program accessibility in Sec.  35.150, and would be  included in the definition of ``facility'' as ``other real or personal  property,'' although standards for new construction and alterations of  such facilities are not yet included in the accessibility standards  adopted by Sec.  35.151. Sections 35.150 and 35.151 specifically address  the obligations of public entities to ensure accessibility by providing  curb ramps at pedestrian walkways.</p><p class="depth0">``Historic preservation programs'' and ``Historic properties'' are  defined in order to aid in the interpretation of Sec. Sec.  35.150  (a)(2) and (b)(2), which relate to accessibility of historic  preservation programs, and Sec.  35.151(d), which relates to the  alteration of historic properties.</p><p class="depth0">``Illegal use of drugs.'' The definition of ``illegal use of drugs''  is taken from section 510(d)(1) of the Act and clarifies that the term  includes the illegal use of one or more drugs.</p><p class="depth0">``Individual with a disability'' means a person who has a disability  but does not include an individual who is currently illegally using  drugs, when the public entity acts on the basis of such use. The phrase  ``current illegal use of drugs'' is explained in Sec.  35.131.</p><p class="depth0">``Public entity.'' The term ``public entity'' is defined in  accordance with section 201(1) of the ADA as any State or local  government; any department, agency, special purpose district, or other  instrumentality of a State or States or local government; or the  National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and any commuter authority (as  defined in section 103(8) of the Rail Passenger Service Act).</p><p class="depth0">``Qualified individual with a disability.'' The definition of  ``qualified individual with a disability'' is taken from section 201(2)  of the Act, which is derived from the definition of ``qualified  handicapped person'' in the Department of Health and Human Services'  regulation implementing section 504 (45 CFR Sec.  84.3(k)). It combines  the definition at 45 CFR 84.3(k)(1) for employment (``a handicapped  person who, with reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential  functions of the job in question'') with the definition for other  services at 45 CFR 84.3(k)(4) (``a handicapped person who meets the  essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of such services'').</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters requested clarification of the term ``essential  eligibility requirements.'' Because of the variety of situations in  which an individual's qualifications will be at issue, it is not  possible to include more   specific criteria in the definition. The ``essential eligibility  requirements'' for participation in some activities covered under this  part may be minimal. For example, most public entities provide  information about their operations as a public service to anyone who  requests it. In such situations, the only ``eligibility requirement''  for receipt of such information would be the request for it. Where such  information is provided by telephone, even the ability to use a voice  telephone is not an ``essential eligibility requirement,'' because Sec.   35.161 requires a public entity to provide equally effective  telecommunication systems for individuals with impaired hearing or  speech.</p><p class="depth0">For other activities, identification of the ``essential eligibility  requirements'' may be more complex. Where questions of safety are  involved, the principles established in Sec.  36.208 of the Department's  regulation implementing title III of the ADA, to be codified at 28 CFR,  part 36, will be applicable. That section implements section 302(b)(3)  of the Act, which provides that a public accommodation is not required  to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the goods,  services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of the  public accommodation, if that individual poses a direct threat to the  health or safety of others.</p><p class="depth0">A ``direct threat'' is a significant risk to the health or safety of  others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies,  practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or  services. In School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273  (1987), the Supreme Court recognized that there is a need to balance the  interests of people with disabilities against legitimate concerns for  public safety. Although persons with disabilities are generally entitled  to the protection of this part, a person who poses a significant risk to  others will not be ``qualified,'' if reasonable modifications to the  public entity's policies, practices, or procedures will not eliminate  that risk.</p><p class="depth0">The determination that a person poses a direct threat to the health  or safety of others may not be based on generalizations or stereotypes  about the effects of a particular disability. It must be based on an  individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on  current medical evidence or on the best available objective evidence, to  determine: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the  probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether  reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will  mitigate the risk. This is the test established by the Supreme Court in  Arline. Such an inquiry is essential if the law is to achieve its goal  of protecting disabled individuals from discrimination based on  prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate  weight to legitimate concerns, such as the need to avoid exposing others  to significant health and safety risks. Making this assessment will not  usually require the services of a physician. Sources for medical  knowledge include guidance from public health authorities, such as the  U.S. Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control, and the  National Institutes of Health, including the National Institute of  Mental Health.</p><p class="depth0">``Qualified interpreter.'' The Department received substantial  comment regarding the lack of a definition of ``qualified interpreter.''  The proposed rule defined auxiliary aids and services to include the  statutory term, ``qualified interpreters'' (Sec.  35.104), but did not  define it. Section 35.160 requires the use of auxiliary aids including  qualified interpreters and commenters stated that a lack of guidance on  what the term means would create confusion among those trying to secure  interpreting services and often result in less than effective  communication.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters were concerned that, without clear guidance on the  issue of ``qualified'' interpreter, the rule would be interpreted to  mean ``available, rather than qualified'' interpreters. Some claimed  that few public entities would understand the difference between a  qualified interpreter and a person who simply knows a few signs or how  to fingerspell.</p><p class="depth0">In order to clarify what is meant by ``qualified interpreter'' the  Department has added a definition of the term to the final rule. A  qualified interpreter means an interpreter who is able to interpret  effectively, accurately, and impartially both receptively and  expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary. This  definition focuses on the actual ability of the interpreter in a  particular interpreting context to facilitate effective communication  between the public entity and the individual with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Public comment also revealed that public entities have at times  asked persons who are deaf to provide family members or friends to  interpret. In certain circumstances, notwithstanding that the family  member of friend is able to interpret or is a certified interpreter, the  family member or friend may not be qualified to render the necessary  interpretation because of factors such as emotional or personal  involvement or considerations of confidentiality that may adversely  affect the ability to interpret``effectively, accurately, and  impartially.''</p><p class="depth0">The definition of ``qualified interpreter'' in this rule does not  invalidate or limit standards for interpreting services of any State or  local law that are equal to or more stringent than those imposed by this  definition. For instance, the definition would not supersede any  requirement of State law for use of a certified interpreter in court  proceedings.</p><p class="depth0">``Section 504.'' The Department added a definition of ``section  504'' because the term is used extensively in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth0">``State.'' The definition of ``State'' is identical to the statutory  definition in section 3(3) of the ADA.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.105 Self-evaluation</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.105 establishes a requirement, based on the section 504  regulations for federally assisted and federally conducted programs,  that a public entity evaluate its current policies and practices to  identify and correct any that are not consistent with the requirements  of this part. As noted in the discussion of Sec.  35.102, activities  covered by the Department of Transportation's regulation implementing  subtitle B of title II are not required to be included in the self- evaluation required by this section.</p><p class="depth0">Experience has demonstrated the self-evaluation process to be a  valuable means of establishing a working relationship with individuals  with disabilities, which has promoted both effective and efficient  implementation of section 504. The Department expects that it will  likewise be useful to public entities newly covered by the ADA.</p><p class="depth0">All public entities are required to do a self-evaluation. However,  only those that employ 50 or more persons are required to maintain the  self-evaluation on file and make it available for public inspection for  three years. The number 50 was derived from the Department of Justice's  section 504 regulations for federally assisted programs, 28 CFR  42.505(c). The Department received comments critical of this limitation,  some suggesting the requirement apply to all public entities and others  suggesting that the number be changed from 50 to 15. The final rule has  not been changed. Although many regulations implementing section 504 for  federally assisted programs do use 15 employees as the cut-off for this  record-keeping requirement, the Department believes that it would be  inappropriate to extend it to those smaller public entities covered by  this regulation that do not receive Federal financial assistance. This  approach has the benefit of minimizing paperwork burdens on small  entities.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (d) provides that the self-evaluation required by this  section shall apply only to programs not subject to section 504 or those  policies and practices, such as those involving communications access,  that have not already been included in a self-evaluation required under  an existing regulation implementing section 504. Because most self- evaluations were done from five to twelve years ago, however, the  Department expects that a great many public entities will be reexamining  all of their policies and programs. Programs and functions may have  changed, and actions that were supposed to have been taken to comply  with section 504 may not have been fully implemented or may no longer be  effective. In addition, there have been statutory amendments to section  504 which have changed the coverage of section 504, particularly the  Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Public Law No. 100-259, 102 Stat.  28 (1988), which broadened the definition of a covered ``program or  activity.''</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters suggested that the Department clarify public  entities' liability during the one-year period for compliance with the  self-evaluation requirement. The self-evaluation requirement does not  stay the effective date of the statute nor of this part. Public entities  are, therefore, not shielded from discrimination claims during that  time.</p><p class="depth0">Other commenters suggested that the rule require that every self- evaluation include an examination of training efforts to assure that  individuals with disabilities are not subjected to discrimination  because of insensitivity, particularly in the law enforcement area.  Although the Department has not added such a specific requirement to the  rule, it would be appropriate for public entities to evaluate training  efforts because, in many cases, lack of training leads to discriminatory  practices, even when the policies in place are nondiscriminatory.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.106 Notice</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.106 requires a public entity to disseminate sufficient  information to applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and other  interested persons to inform them of the rights and protections afforded  by the ADA and this regulation. Methods of providing this information  include, for example, the publication of information in handbooks,  manuals, and pamphlets that are distributed to the public to describe a  public entity's programs and activities; the display of informative  posters in service centers and other public places; or the broadcast of  information by television or radio. In providing the notice, a public  entity must comply with the requirements for effective communication in  Sec.  35.160. The preamble to that section gives guidance on how to  effectively communicate with individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.107 Designation of Responsible Employee and Adoption of</p><p class="depth0">Grievance Procedures</p><p class="depth0">Consistent with Sec.  35.105, self-evaluation, the final rule  requires that public entities with 50 or more employees designate a  responsible employee and adopt grievance procedures. Most of the  commenters who suggested that the requirement that self-evaluation be  maintained on file for three years not be limited to those employing 50  or more persons made a similar suggestion concerning Sec.  35.107.  Commenters recommended either that all public entities be subject to  Sec.  35.107, or that ``50 or more persons'' be changed to ``15 or more  persons.'' As explained in the discussion of Sec.  35.105, the  Department has not adopted this suggestion.</p><p class="depth0">The requirement for designation of an employee responsible for  coordination of efforts to carry out responsibilities under this part is  derived from the HEW regulation implementing section 504 in federally  assisted programs. The requirement for designation of a particular  employee and dissemination of information about how to locate that  employee helps to ensure that individuals dealing with large agencies  are able to easily find a responsible person who is familiar with the  requirements of the Act and this part and can communicate those  requirements to other individuals in the agency who may be unaware of  their responsibilities. This paragraph in no way limits a public  entity's obligation to ensure that all of its employees comply with the  requirements of this part, but it ensures that any failure by individual  employees can be promptly corrected by the designated employee.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.107(b) requires public entities with 50 or more employees  to establish grievance procedures for resolving complaints of violations  of this part. Similar requirements are found in the section 504  regulations for federally assisted programs (see, e.g., 45 CFR 84.7(b)).  The rule, like the regulations for federally assisted programs, provides  for investigation and resolution of complaints by a Federal enforcement  agency. It is the view of the Department that public entities subject to  this part should be required to establish a mechanism for resolution of  complaints at the local level without requiring the complainant to  resort to the Federal complaint procedures established under subpart F.  Complainants would not, however, be required to exhaust the public  entity's grievance procedures before filing a complaint under subpart F.  Delay in filing the complaint at the Federal level caused by pursuit of  the remedies available under the grievance procedure would generally be  considered good cause for extending the time allowed for filing under  Sec.  35.170(b).</p><p class="depth0">Subpart B--General Requirements</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.130 General Prohibitions Against Discrimination</p><p class="depth0">The general prohibitions against discrimination in the rule are  generally based on the prohibitions in existing regulations implementing  section 504 and, therefore, are already familiar to State and local  entities covered by section 504. In addition, Sec.  35.130 includes a  number of provisions derived from title III of the Act that are implicit  to a certain degree in the requirements of regulations implementing  section 504.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters suggested that this part should include the  section of the proposed title III regulation that implemented section  309 of the Act, which requires that courses and examinations related to  applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing be provided in  an accessible place and manner or that alternative accessible  arrangements be made. The Department has not adopted this suggestion.  The requirements of this part, including the general prohibitions of  discrimination in this section, the program access requirements of  subpart D, and the communications requirements of subpart E, apply to  courses and examinations provided by public entities. The Department  considers these requirements to be sufficient to ensure that courses and  examinations administered by public entities meet the requirements of  section 309. For example, a public entity offering an examination must  ensure that modifications of policies, practices, or procedures or the  provision of auxiliary aids and services furnish the individual with a  disability an equal opportunity to demonstrate his or her knowledge or  ability. Also, any examination specially designed for individuals with  disabilities must be offered as often and in as timely a manner as are  other examinations. Further, under this part, courses and examinations  must be offered in the most integrated setting appropriate. The analysis  of Sec.  35.130(d) is relevant to this determination.</p><p class="depth0">A number of commenters asked that the regulation be amended to  require training of law enforcement personnel to recognize the  difference between criminal activity and the effects of seizures or  other disabilities such as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, traumatic  brain injury, mental illness, or deafness. Several disabled commenters  gave personal statements about the abuse they had received at the hands  of law enforcement personnel. Two organizations that commented cited the  Judiciary report at 50 as authority to require law enforcement training.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has not added such a training requirement to the  regulation. Discriminatory arrests and brutal treatment are already  unlawful police activities. The general regulatory obligation to modify  policies, practices, or procedures requires law enforcement to make  changes in policies that result in discriminatory arrests or abuse of  individuals with disabilities. Under this section law enforcement  personnel would be required to make appropriate efforts to determine  whether perceived strange or disruptive behavior or unconsciousness is  the result of a disability. The Department notes that a number of States  have attempted to address the problem of arresting disabled persons for  noncriminal conduct resulting from their disability through adoption of  the Uniform Duties to Disabled Persons Act, and encourages other  jurisdictions to consider that approach.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (a) restates the nondiscrimination mandate of section 202  of the ADA. The remaining paragraphs in Sec.  35.130 establish the  general principles for analyzing whether any   particular action of the public entity violates this mandate.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b) prohibits overt denials of equal treatment of  individuals with disabilities. A public entity may not refuse to provide  an individual with a disability with an equal opportunity to participate  in or benefit from its program simply because the person has a  disability.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(1)(i) provides that it is discriminatory to deny a  person with a disability the right to participate in or benefit from the  aid, benefit, or service provided by a public entity. Paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) provides that the aids, benefits, and services provided to  persons with disabilities must be equal to those provided to others, and  paragraph (b)(1)(iii) requires that the aids, benefits, or services  provided to individuals with disabilities must be as effective in  affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same  benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as those provided to  others. These paragraphs are taken from the regulations implementing  section 504 and simply restate principles long established under section  504.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) permits the public entity to develop separate  or different aids, benefits, or services when necessary to provide  individuals with disabilities with an equal opportunity to participate  in or benefit from the public entity's programs or activities, but only  when necessary to ensure that the aids, benefits, or services are as  effective as those provided to others. Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) must be read  in conjunction with paragraphs (b)(2), (d), and (e). Even when separate  or different aids, benefits, or services would be more effective,  paragraph (b)(2) provides that a qualified individual with a disability  still has the right to choose to participate in the program that is not  designed to accommodate individuals with disabilities. Paragraph (d)  requires that a public entity administer services, programs, and  activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of  qualified individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(2) specifies that, notwithstanding the existence of  separate or different programs or activities provided in accordance with  this section, an individual with a disability shall not be denied the  opportunity to participate in such programs or activities that are not  separate or different. Paragraph (e), which is derived from section  501(d) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, states that nothing in  this part shall be construed to require an individual with a disability  to accept an accommodation, aid, service, opportunity, or benefit that  he or she chooses not to accept.</p><p class="depth0">Taken together, these provisions are intended to prohibit exclusion  and segregation of individuals with disabilities and the denial of equal  opportunities enjoyed by others, based on, among other things,  presumptions, patronizing attitudes, fears, and stereotypes about  individuals with disabilities. Consistent with these standards, public  entities are required to ensure that their actions are based on facts  applicable to individuals and not on presumptions as to what a class of  individuals with disabilities can or cannot do.</p><p class="depth0">Integration is fundamental to the purposes of the Americans with  Disabilities Act. Provision of segregated accommodations and services  relegates persons with disabilities to second-class status. For example,  it would be a violation of this provision to require persons with  disabilities to eat in the back room of a government cafeteria or to  refuse to allow a person with a disability the full use of recreation or  exercise facilities because of stereotypes about the person's ability to  participate.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters objected to proposed paragraphs (b)(1)(iv) and (d)  as allowing continued segregation of individuals with disabilities. The  Department recognizes that promoting integration of individuals with  disabilities into the mainstream of society is an important objective of  the ADA and agrees that, in most instances, separate programs for  individuals with disabilities will not be permitted. Nevertheless,  section 504 does permit separate programs in limited circumstances, and  Congress clearly intended the regulations issued under title II to adopt  the standards of section 504. Furthermore, Congress included authority  for separate programs in the specific requirements of title III of the  Act. Section 302(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act provides for separate benefits  in language similar to that in Sec.  35.130(b)(1)(iv), and section  302(b)(1)(B) includes the same requirement for ``the most integrated  setting appropriate'' as in Sec.  35.130(d).</p><p class="depth0">Even when separate programs are permitted, individuals with  disabilities cannot be denied the opportunity to participate in programs  that are not separate or different. This is an important and overarching  principle of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Separate, special, or  different programs that are designed to provide a benefit to persons  with disabilities cannot be used to restrict the participation of  persons with disabilities in general, integrated activities.</p><p class="depth0">For example, a person who is blind may wish to decline participating  in a special museum tour that allows persons to touch sculptures in an  exhibit and instead tour the exhibit at his or her own pace with the  museum's recorded tour. It is not the intent of this section to require  the person who is blind to avail himself or herself of the special tour.  Modified participation for persons with disabilities must be a choice,  not a requirement.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, it would not be a violation of this section for a  public entity to offer recreational programs specially designed for  children with mobility impairments. However, it would be a violation of  this section if the entity then excluded these children from other  recreational services for which they are qualified to participate when  these services are made available to nondisabled children, or if the  entity required children with disabilities to attend only designated  programs.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters asked that the Department clarify a public entity's  obligations within the integrated program when it offers a separate  program but an individual with a disability chooses not to participate  in the separate program. It is impossible to make a blanket statement as  to what level of auxiliary aids or modifications would be required in  the integrated program. Rather, each situation must be assessed  individually. The starting point is to question whether the separate  program is in fact necessary or appropriate for the individual. Assuming  the separate program would be appropriate for a particular individual,  the extent to which that individual must be provided with modifications  in the integrated program will depend not only on what the individual  needs but also on the limitations and defenses of this part. For  example, it may constitute an undue burden for a public accommodation,  which provides a full-time interpreter in its special guided tour for  individuals with hearing impairments, to hire an additional interpreter  for those individuals who choose to attend the integrated program. The  Department cannot identify categorically the level of assistance or aid  required in the integrated program.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(1)(v) provides that a public entity may not aid or  perpetuate discrimination against a qualified individual with a  disability by providing significant assistance to an agency,  organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of disability in  providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the public  entity's program. This paragraph is taken from the regulations  implementing section 504 for federally assisted programs.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) prohibits the public entity from denying a  qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate as  a member of a planning or advisory board.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(1)(vii) prohibits the public entity from limiting a  qualified individual with a disability in the enjoyment of any right,  privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving any  aid, benefit, or service.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(3) prohibits the public entity from utilizing criteria  or methods of administration that deny individuals with disabilities  access to the public entity's services, programs, and activities or that  perpetuate the discrimination of another public entity, if both public  entities are subject to common administrative control or are agencies of  the same State. The phrase ``criteria or methods of administration''  refers to official written policies of the public entity and to the  actual practices of the public entity. This paragraph prohibits both  blatantly exclusionary policies or practices and nonessential policies  and practices that are neutral on their face, but deny individuals with  disabilities an effective opportunity to participate. This standard is  consistent with the interpretation of section 504 by the U.S. Supreme  Court in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985). The Court in Choate  explained that members of Congress made numerous statements during  passage of section 504 regarding eliminating architectural barriers,  providing access to transportation, and eliminating discriminatory  effects of job qualification procedures. The Court then noted: ``These  statements would ring hollow if the resulting legislation could not  rectify the harms resulting from action that discriminated by effect as  well as by design.'' Id. at 297 (footnote omitted).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(4) specifically applies the prohibition enunciated in  Sec.  35.130(b)(3) to the process of selecting sites for construction of  new facilities or selecting existing facilities to be used by the public  entity. Paragraph (b)(4) does not apply to construction of additional  buildings at an existing site.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(5) prohibits the public entity, in the selection of  procurement contractors, from using criteria that subject qualified  individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of  disability.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(6) prohibits the public entity from discriminating  against qualified individuals with disabilities on the basis of  disability in the granting of licenses or certification. A person is a  ``qualified individual with a disability'' with respect to licensing or  certification if he or she can meet the essential eligibility  requirements for receiving the license or certification (see Sec.   35.104).</p><p class="depth0">A number of commenters were troubled by the phrase ``essential  eligibility requirements'' as applied to State licensing requirements,  especially those for health care professions. Because of the variety of  types of programs to which the definition of ``qualified individual with  a disability'' applies, it is not possible to use more specific language  in the definition. The phrase ``essential eligibility requirements,''  however, is taken from the definitions in the regulations implementing  section 504, so caselaw under section 504 will be applicable to its  interpretation. In Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S.  397, for example, the Supreme Court held that section 504 does not  require an institution to ``lower or effect substantial modifications of  standards to accommodate   a handicapped person,'' 442 U.S. at 413, and that the school had  established that the plaintiff was not ``qualified'' because she was not  able to ``serve the nursing profession in all customary ways,'' id.  Whether a particular requirement is ``essential'' will, of course,  depend on the facts of the particular case.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, the public entity may not establish requirements for  the programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that  subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the  basis of disability. For example, the public entity must comply with  this requirement when establishing safety standards for the operations  of licensees. In that case the public entity must ensure that standards  that it promulgates do not discriminate against the employment of  qualified individuals with disabilities in an impermissible manner.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(6) does not extend the requirements of the Act or this  part directly to the programs or activities of licensees or certified  entities themselves. The programs or activities of licensees or  certified entities are not themselves programs or activities of the  public entity merely by virtue of the license or certificate.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(7) is a specific application of the requirement under  the general prohibitions of discrimination that public entities make  reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures where  necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability. Section  302(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the ADA sets out this requirement specifically for  public accommodations covered by title III of the Act, and the House  Judiciary Committee Report directs the Attorney General to include those  specific requirements in the title II regulation to the extent that they  do not conflict with the regulations implementing section 504. Judiciary  report at 52.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(8), a new paragraph not contained in the proposed  rule, prohibits the imposition or application of eligibility criteria  that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or  any class of individuals with disabilities from fully and equally  enjoying any service, program, or activity, unless such criteria can be  shown to be necessary for the provision of the service, program, or  activity being offered. This prohibition is also a specific application  of the general prohibitions of discrimination and is based on section  302(b)(2)(A)(i) of the ADA. It prohibits overt denials of equal  treatment of individuals with disabilities, or establishment of  exclusive or segregative criteria that would bar individuals with  disabilities from participation in services, benefits, or activities.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(8) also prohibits policies that unnecessarily impose  requirements or burdens on individuals with disabilities that are not  placed on others. For example, public entities may not require that a  qualified individual with a disability be accompanied by an attendant. A  public entity is not, however, required to provide attendant care, or  assistance in toileting, eating, or dressing to individuals with  disabilities, except in special circumstances, such as where the  individual is an inmate of a custodial or correctional institution.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, paragraph (b)(8) prohibits the imposition of criteria  that ``tend to'' screen out an individual with a disability. This  concept, which is derived from current regulations under section 504  (see, e.g., 45 CFR 84.13), makes it discriminatory to impose policies or  criteria that, while not creating a direct bar to individuals with  disabilities, indirectly prevent or limit their ability to participate.  For example, requiring presentation of a driver's license as the sole  means of identification for purposes of paying by check would violate  this section in situations where, for example, individuals with severe  vision impairments or developmental disabilities or epilepsy are  ineligible to receive a driver's license and the use of an alternative  means of identification, such as another photo I.D. or credit card, is  feasible.</p><p class="depth0">A public entity may, however, impose neutral rules and criteria that  screen out, or tend to screen out, individuals with disabilities if the  criteria are necessary for the safe operation of the program in  question. Examples of safety qualifications that would be justifiable in  appropriate circumstances would include eligibility requirements for  drivers' licenses, or a requirement that all participants in a  recreational rafting expedition be able to meet a necessary level of  swimming proficiency. Safety requirements must be based on actual risks  and not on speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about  individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (c) provides that nothing in this part prohibits a public  entity from providing benefits, services, or advantages to individuals  with disabilities, or to a particular class of individuals with  disabilities, beyond those required by this part. It is derived from a  provision in the section 504 regulations that permits programs conducted  pursuant to Federal statute or Executive order that are designed to  benefit only individuals with disabilities or a given class of  individuals with disabilities to be limited to those individuals with  disabilities. Section 504 ensures that federally assisted programs are  made available to all individuals, without regard to disabilities,  unless the Federal program under which the assistance is provided is  specifically limited to individuals with disabilities or a particular  class of individuals with disabilities. Because coverage under this part  is not limited to federally assisted programs, paragraph (c) has been  revised to clarify that State and local governments may provide special  benefits, beyond those required by   the nondiscrimination requirements of this part, that are limited to  individuals with disabilities or a particular class of individuals with  disabilities, without thereby incurring additional obligations to  persons without disabilities or to other classes of individuals with  disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraphs (d) and (e), previously referred to in the discussion of  paragraph (b)(1)(iv), provide that the public entity must administer  services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting  appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities,  i.e., in a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to  interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible, and  that persons with disabilities must be provided the option of declining  to accept a particular accommodation.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters expressed concern that Sec.  35.130(e), which states  that nothing in the rule requires an individual with a disability to  accept special accommodations and services provided under the ADA, could  be interpreted to allow guardians of infants or older people with  disabilities to refuse medical treatment for their wards. Section  35.130(e) has been revised to make it clear that paragraph (e) is  inapplicable to the concern of the commenters. A new paragraph (e)(2)  has been added stating that nothing in the regulation authorizes the  representative or guardian of an individual with a disability to decline  food, water, medical treatment, or medical services for that individual.  New paragraph (e) clarifies that neither the ADA nor the regulation  alters current Federal law ensuring the rights of incompetent  individuals with disabilities to receive food, water, and medical  treatment. See, e.g., Child Abuse Amendments of 1984 (42 U.S.C.  5106a(b)(10), 5106g(10)); Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29  U.S.C. 794); the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights  Act (42 U.S.C. 6042).</p><p class="depth0">Sections 35.130(e) (1) and (2) are based on section 501(d) of the  ADA. Section 501(d) was designed to clarify that nothing in the ADA  requires individuals with disabilities to accept special accommodations  and services for individuals with disabilities that may segregate them:</p><p class="depth0">The Committee added this section [501(d)] to clarify that nothing in  the ADA is intended to permit discriminatory treatment on the basis of  disability, even when such treatment is rendered under the guise of  providing an accommodation, service, aid or benefit to the individual  with disability. For example, a blind individual may choose not to avail  himself or herself of the right to go to the front of a line, even if a  particular public accommodation has chosen to offer such a modification  of a policy for blind individuals. Or, a blind individual may choose to  decline to participate in a special museum tour that allows persons to  touch sculptures in an exhibit and instead tour the exhibits at his or  her own pace with the museum's recorded tour.  Judiciary report at 71-72. The Act is not to be construed to mean that  an individual with disabilities must accept special accommodations and  services for individuals with disabilities when that individual can  participate in the regular services already offered. Because medical  treatment, including treatment for particular conditions, is not a  special accommodation or service for individuals with disabilities under  section 501(d), neither the Act nor this part provides affirmative  authority to suspend such treatment. Section 501(d) is intended to  clarify that the Act is not designed to foster discrimination through  mandatory acceptance of special services when other alternatives are  provided; this concern does not reach to the provision of medical  treatment for the disabling condition itself.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (f) provides that a public entity may not place a  surcharge on a particular individual with a disability, or any group of  individuals with disabilities, to cover any costs of measures required  to provide that individual or group with the nondiscriminatory treatment  required by the Act or this part. Such measures may include the  provision of auxiliary aids or of modifications required to provide  program accessibility.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters asked for clarification that the costs of  interpreter services may not be assessed as an element of ``court  costs.'' The Department has already recognized that imposition of the  cost of courtroom interpreter services is impermissible under section  504. The preamble to the Department's section 504 regulation for its  federally assisted programs states that where a court system has an  obligation to provide qualified interpreters, ``it has the corresponding  responsibility to pay for the services of the interpreters.'' (45 FR  37630 (June 3, 1980)). Accordingly, recouping the costs of interpreter  services by assessing them as part of court costs would also be  prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (g), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of an  individual's or entity's known relationship or association with an  individual with a disability, is based on sections 102(b)(4) and  302(b)(1)(E) of the ADA. This paragraph was not contained in the  proposed rule. The individuals covered under this paragraph are any  individuals who are discriminated against because of their known  association with an individual with a disability. For example, it would  be a violation of this paragraph for a local government to refuse to  allow a theater company to use a school auditorium on the grounds that  the company had recently performed for an audience of individuals with  HIV disease.</p><p class="depth0">This protection is not limited to those who have a familial  relationship with the individual who has a disability. Congress  considered, and rejected, amendments that would have limited the scope  of this provision to specific associations and relationships. Therefore,  if a public entity refuses admission to a person with cerebral palsy and  his or her companions, the companions have an independent right of  action under the ADA and this section.</p><p class="depth0">During the legislative process, the term ``entity'' was added to  section 302(b)(1)(E) to clarify that the scope of the provision is  intended to encompass not only persons who have a known association with  a person with a disability, but also entities that provide services to  or are otherwise associated with such individuals. This provision was  intended to ensure that entities such as health care providers,  employees of social service agencies, and others who provide  professional services to persons with disabilities are not subjected to  discrimination because of their professional association with persons  with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.131 Illegal Use of Drugs</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.131 effectuates section 510 of the ADA, which clarifies  the Act's application to people who use drugs illegally. Paragraph (a)  provides that this part does not prohibit discrimination based on an  individual's current illegal use of drugs.</p><p class="depth0">The Act and the regulation distinguish between illegal use of drugs  and the legal use of substances, whether or not those substances are  ``controlled substances,'' as defined in the Controlled Substances Act  (21 U.S.C. 812). Some controlled substances are prescription drugs that  have legitimate medical uses. Section 35.131 does not affect use of  controlled substances pursuant to a valid prescription under supervision  by a licensed health care professional, or other use that is authorized  by the Controlled Substances Act or any other provision of Federal law.  It does apply to illegal use of those substances, as well as to illegal  use of controlled substances that are not prescription drugs. The key  question is whether the individual's use of the substance is illegal,  not whether the substance has recognized legal uses. Alcohol is not a  controlled substance, so use of alcohol is not addressed by Sec.  35.131  (although alcoholics are individuals with disabilities, subject to the  protections of the statute).</p><p class="depth0">A distinction is also made between the use of a substance and the  status of being addicted to that substance. Addiction is a disability,  and addicts are individuals with disabilities protected by the Act. The  protection, however, does not extend to actions based on the illegal use  of the substance. In other words, an addict cannot use the fact of his  or her addiction as a defense to an action based on illegal use of  drugs. This distinction is not artificial. Congress intended to deny  protection to people who engage in the illegal use of drugs, whether or  not they are addicted, but to provide protection to addicts so long as  they are not currently using drugs.</p><p class="depth0">A third distinction is the difficult one between current use and  former use. The definition of ``current illegal use of drugs'' in Sec.   35.104, which is based on the report of the Conference Committee, H.R.  Conf. Rep. No. 596, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 64 (1990) (hereinafter  ``Conference report''), is ``illegal use of drugs that occurred recently  enough to justify a reasonable belief that a person's drug use is  current or that continuing use is a real and ongoing problem.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (a)(2)(i) specifies that an individual who has  successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program or has  otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and who is not engaging in  current illegal use of drugs is protected. Paragraph (a)(2)(ii)  clarifies that an individual who is currently participating in a  supervised rehabilitation program and is not engaging in current illegal  use of drugs is protected. Paragraph (a)(2)(iii) provides that a person  who is erroneously regarded as engaging in current illegal use of drugs,  but who is not engaging in such use, is protected.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b) provides a limited exception to the exclusion of  current illegal users of drugs from the protections of the Act. It  prohibits denial of health services, or services provided in connection  with drug rehabilitation to an individual on the basis of current  illegal use of drugs, if the individual is otherwise entitled to such  services. A health care facility, such as a hospital or clinic, may not  refuse treatment to an individual in need of the services it provides on  the grounds that the individual is illegally using drugs, but it is not  required by this section to provide services that it does not ordinarily  provide. For example, a health care facility that specializes in a  particular type of treatment, such as care of burn victims, is not  required to provide drug rehabilitation services, but it cannot refuse  to treat an individual's burns on the grounds that the individual is  illegally using drugs.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters pointed out that abstention from the use of drugs is  an essential condition of participation in some drug rehabilitation  programs, and may be a necessary requirement in inpatient or residential  settings. The Department believes that this comment is well-founded.  Congress clearly intended to prohibit exclusion from drug treatment  programs of the very individuals who need such programs because of their  use of drugs, but, once an individual has been admitted to a program,  abstention may be a necessary and appropriate condition to continued  participation. The final rule therefore   provides that a drug rehabilitation or treatment program may prohibit  illegal use of drugs by individuals while they are participating in the  program.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (c) expresses Congress' intention that the Act be neutral  with respect to testing for illegal use of drugs. This paragraph  implements the provision in section 510(b) of the Act that allows  entities ``to adopt or administer reasonable policies or procedures,  including but not limited to drug testing,'' that ensure that an  individual who is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program,  or who has completed such a program or otherwise been rehabilitated  successfully is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs. The  section is not to be ``construed to encourage, prohibit, restrict, or  authorize the conducting of testing for the illegal use of drugs.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35.131(c) clarifies that it is not a violation of this  part to adopt or administer reasonable policies or procedures to ensure  that an individual who formerly engaged in the illegal use of drugs is  not currently engaging in illegal use of drugs. Any such policies or  procedures must, of course, be reasonable, and must be designed to  identify accurately the illegal use of drugs. This paragraph does not  authorize inquiries, tests, or other procedures that would disclose use  of substances that are not controlled substances or are taken under  supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other uses  authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or other provisions of  Federal law, because such uses are not included in the definition of  ``illegal use of drugs.'' A commenter argued that the rule should permit  testing for lawful use of prescription drugs, but most commenters  preferred that tests must be limited to unlawful use in order to avoid  revealing the lawful use of prescription medicine used to treat  disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.132 Smoking</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.132 restates the clarification in section 501(b) of the  Act that the Act does not preclude the prohibition of, or imposition of  restrictions on, smoking in transportation covered by title II. Some  commenters argued that this section is too limited in scope, and that  the regulation should prohibit smoking in all facilities used by public  entities. The reference to smoking in section 501, however, merely  clarifies that the Act does not require public entities to accommodate  smokers by permitting them to smoke in transportation facilities.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.133 Maintenance of Accessible Features</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.133 provides that a public entity shall maintain in  operable working condition those features of facilities and equipment  that are required to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with  disabilities by the Act or this part. The Act requires that, to the  maximum extent feasible, facilities must be accessible to, and usable  by, individuals with disabilities. This section recognizes that it is  not sufficient to provide features such as accessible routes, elevators,  or ramps, if those features are not maintained in a manner that enables  individuals with disabilities to use them. Inoperable elevators, locked  accessible doors, or ``accessible'' routes that are obstructed by  furniture, filing cabinets, or potted plants are neither ``accessible  to'' nor ``usable by'' individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters objected that this section appeared to establish an  absolute requirement and suggested that language from the preamble be  included in the text of the regulation. It is, of course, impossible to  guarantee that mechanical devices will never fail to operate. Paragraph  (b) of the final regulation provides that this section does not prohibit  isolated or temporary interruptions in service or access due to  maintenance or repairs. This paragraph is intended to clarify that  temporary obstructions or isolated instances of mechanical failure would  not be considered violations of the Act or this part. However, allowing  obstructions or ``out of service'' equipment to persist beyond a  reasonable period of time would violate this part, as would repeated  mechanical failures due to improper or inadequate maintenance. Failure  of the public entity to ensure that accessible routes are properly  maintained and free of obstructions, or failure to arrange prompt repair  of inoperable elevators or other equipment intended to provide access  would also violate this part.</p><p class="depth0">Other commenters requested that this section be expanded to include  specific requirements for inspection and maintenance of equipment, for  training staff in the proper operation of equipment, and for maintenance  of specific items. The Department believes that this section properly  establishes the general requirement for maintaining access and that  further details are not necessary.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.134 Retaliation or Coercion</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.134 implements section 503 of the ADA, which prohibits  retaliation against any individual who exercises his or her rights under  the Act. This section is unchanged from the proposed rule. Paragraph (a)  of Sec.  35.134 provides that no private or public entity shall  discriminate against any individual because that individual has  exercised his or her right to oppose any act or practice made unlawful  by this part, or because that individual made a charge, testified,  assisted, or participated in any manner   in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Act or this part.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b) provides that no private or public entity shall  coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any individual in the  exercise of his or her rights under this part or because that individual  aided or encouraged any other individual in the exercise or enjoyment of  any right granted or protected by the Act or this part.</p><p class="depth0">This section protects not only individuals who allege a violation of  the Act or this part, but also any individuals who support or assist  them. This section applies to all investigations or proceedings  initiated under the Act or this part without regard to the ultimate  resolution of the underlying allegations. Because this section prohibits  any act of retaliation or coercion in response to an individual's effort  to exercise rights established by the Act and this part (or to support  the efforts of another individual), the section applies not only to  public entities subject to this part, but also to persons acting in an  individual capacity or to private entities. For example, it would be a  violation of the Act and this part for a private individual to harass or  intimidate an individual with a disability in an effort to prevent that  individual from attending a concert in a State-owned park. It would,  likewise, be a violation of the Act and this part for a private entity  to take adverse action against an employee who appeared as a witness on  behalf of an individual who sought to enforce the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.135 Personal Devices and Services</p><p class="depth0">The final rule includes a new Sec.  35.135, entitles ``Personal  devices and services,'' which states that the provision of personal  devices and services is not required by title II. This new section,  which serves as a limitation on all of the requirements of the  regulation, replaces Sec.  35.160(b)(2) of the proposed rule, which  addressed the issue of personal devices and services explicitly only in  the context of communications. The personal devices and services  limitation was intended to have general application in the proposed rule  in all contexts where it was relevant. The final rule, therefore,  clarifies this point by including a general provision that will  explicitly apply not only to auxiliary aids and services but across-the- board to include other relevant areas such as, for example,  modifications in policies, practices, and procedures (Sec.   35.130(b)(7)). The language of Sec.  35.135 parallels an analogous  provision in the Department's title III regulations (28 CFR 36.306) but  preserves the explicit reference to ``readers for personal use or  study'' in Sec.  35.160(b)(2) of the proposed rule. This section does  not preclude the short-term loan of personal receivers that are part of  an assistive listening system.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart C--Employment</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.140 Employment Discrimination Prohibited</p><p class="depth0">Title II of the ADA applies to all activities of public entities,  including their employment practices. The proposed rule cross-referenced  the definitions, requirements, and procedures of title I of the ADA, as  established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR  part 1630. This proposal would have resulted in use, under Sec.  35.140,  of the title I definition of ``employer,'' so that a public entity with  25 or more employees would have become subject to the requirements of  Sec.  35.140 on July 26, 1992, one with 15 to 24 employees on July 26,  1994, and one with fewer than 15 employees would have been excluded  completely.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received comments objecting to this approach. The  commenters asserted that Congress intended to establish  nondiscrimination requirements for employment by all public entities,  including those that employ fewer than 15 employees; and that Congress  intended the employment requirements of title II to become effective at  the same time that the other requirements of this regulation become  effective, January 26, 1992. The Department has reexamined the statutory  language and legislative history of the ADA on this issue and has  concluded that Congress intended to cover the employment practices of  all public entities and that the applicable effective date is that of  title II.</p><p class="depth0">The statutory language of section 204(b) of the ADA requires the  Department to issue a regulation that is consistent with the ADA and the  Department's coordination regulation under section 504, 28 CFR part 41.  The coordination regulation specifically requires nondiscrimination in  employment, 28 CFR 41.52-41.55, and does not limit coverage based on  size of employer. Moreover, under all section 504 implementing  regulations issued in accordance with the Department's coordination  regulation, employment coverage under section 504 extends to all  employers with federally assisted programs or activities, regardless of  size, and the effective date for those employment requirements has  always been the same as the effective date for nonemployment  requirements established in the same regulations. The Department  therefore concludes that Sec.  35.140 must apply to all public entities  upon the effective date of this regulation.</p><p class="depth0">In the proposed regulation the Department cross-referenced the  regulations implementing title I of the ADA, issued by the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission at 29 CFR part 1630, as a compliance  standard for Sec.  35.140 because, as proposed, the scope of coverage  and effective date of coverage under title II would have been  coextensive   with title I. In the final regulation this language is modified  slightly. Subparagraph (1) of new paragraph (b) makes it clear that the  standards established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in  29 CFR part 1630 will be the applicable compliance standards if the  public entity is subject to title I. If the public entity is not covered  by title I, or until it is covered by title I, subparagraph (b)(2)  cross-references section 504 standards for what constitutes employment  discrimination, as established by the Department of Justice in 28 CFR  part 41. Standards for title I of the ADA and section 504 of the  Rehabilitation Act are for the most part identical because title I of  the ADA was based on requirements set forth in regulations implementing  section 504.</p><p class="depth0">The Department, together with the other Federal agencies responsible  for the enforcement of Federal laws prohibiting employment  discrimination on the basis of disability, recognizes the potential for  jurisdictional overlap that exists with respect to coverage of public  entities and the need to avoid problems related to overlapping coverage.  The other Federal agencies include the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission, which is the agency primarily responsible for enforcement of  title I of the ADA, the Department of Labor, which is the agency  responsible for enforcement of section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of  1973, and 26 Federal agencies with programs of Federal financial  assistance, which are responsible for enforcing section 504 in those  programs. Section 107 of the ADA requires that coordination mechanisms  be developed in connection with the administrative enforcement of  complaints alleging discrimination under title I and complaints alleging  discrimination in employment in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.  Although the ADA does not specifically require inclusion of employment  complaints under title II in the coordinating mechanisms required by  title I, Federal investigations of title II employment complaints will  be coordinated on a government-wide basis also. The Department is  currently working with the EEOC and other affected Federal agencies to  develop effective coordinating mechanisms, and final regulations on this  issue will be issued on or before January 26, 1992.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart D--Program Accessibility</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.149 Discrimination Prohibited</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.149 states the general nondiscrimination principle  underlying the program accessibility requirements of Sec. Sec.  35.150  and 35.151.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.150 Existing Facilities</p><p class="depth0">Consistent with section 204(b) of the Act, this regulation adopts  the program accessibility concept found in the section 504 regulations  for federally conducted programs or activities (e.g., 28 CFR part 39).  The concept of ``program accessibility'' was first used in the section  504 regulation adopted by the Department of Health, Education, and  Welfare for its federally assisted programs and activities in 1977. It  allowed recipients to make their federally assisted programs and  activities available to individuals with disabilities without extensive  retrofitting of their existing buildings and facilities, by offering  those programs through alternative methods. Program accessibility has  proven to be a useful approach and was adopted in the regulations issued  for programs and activities conducted by Federal Executive agencies. The  Act provides that the concept of program access will continue to apply  with respect to facilities now in existence, because the cost of  retrofitting existing facilities is often prohibitive.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.150 requires that each service, program, or activity  conducted by a public entity, when viewed in its entirety, be readily  accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The  regulation makes clear, however, that a public entity is not required to  make each of its existing facilities accessible (Sec.  35.150(a)(1)).  Unlike title III of the Act, which requires public accommodations to  remove architectural barriers where such removal is ``readily  achievable,'' or to provide goods and services through alternative  methods, where those methods are ``readily achievable,'' title II  requires a public entity to make its programs accessible in all cases,  except where to do so would result in a fundamental alteration in the  nature of the program or in undue financial and administrative burdens.  Congress intended the ``undue burden'' standard in title II to be  significantly higher than the ``readily achievable'' standard in title  III. Thus, although title II may not require removal of barriers in some  cases where removal would be required under title III, the program  access requirement of title II should enable individuals with  disabilities to participate in and benefit from the services, programs,  or activities of public entities in all but the most unusual cases.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (a)(2), which establishes a special limitation on the  obligation to ensure program accessibility in historic preservation  programs, is discussed below in connection with paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (a)(3), which is taken from the section 504 regulations  for federally conducted programs, generally codifies case law that  defines the scope of the public entity's obligation to ensure program  accessibility. This paragraph provides that, in meeting the program  accessibility requirement, a public entity is not required to take any  action that would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of  its service, program,   or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. A similar  limitation is provided in Sec.  35.164.</p><p class="depth0">This paragraph does not establish an absolute defense; it does not  relieve a public entity of all obligations to individuals with  disabilities. Although a public entity is not required to take actions  that would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a  service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative  burdens, it nevertheless must take any other steps necessary to ensure  that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits or services  provided by the public entity.</p><p class="depth0">It is the Department's view that compliance with Sec.  35.150(a),  like compliance with the corresponding provisions of the section 504  regulations for federally conducted programs, would in most cases not  result in undue financial and administrative burdens on a public entity.  In determining whether financial and administrative burdens are undue,  all public entity resources available for use in the funding and  operation of the service, program, or activity should be considered. The  burden of proving that compliance with paragraph (a) of Sec.  35.150  would fundamentally alter the nature of a service, program, or activity  or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens rests with  the public entity.</p><p class="depth0">The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or  burdens must be made by the head of the public entity or his or her  designee and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons  for reaching that conclusion. The Department recognizes the difficulty  of identifying the official responsible for this determination, given  the variety of organizational forms that may be taken by public entities  and their components. The intention of this paragraph is that the  determination must be made by a high level official, no lower than a  Department head, having budgetary authority and responsibility for  making spending decisions.</p><p class="depth0">Any person who believes that he or she or any specific class of  persons has been injured by the public entity head's decision or failure  to make a decision may file a complaint under the compliance procedures  established in subpart F.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(1) sets forth a number of means by which program  accessibility may be achieved, including redesign of equipment,  reassignment of services to accessible buildings, and provision of  aides.</p><p class="depth0">The Department wishes to clarify that, consistent with longstanding  interpretation of section 504, carrying an individual with a disability  is considered an ineffective and therefore an unacceptable method for  achieving program accessibility. Department of Health, Education, and  Welfare, Office of Civil Rights, Policy Interpretation No. 4, 43 FR  36035 (August 14, 1978). Carrying will be permitted only in manifestly  exceptional cases, and only if all personnel who are permitted to  participate in carrying an individual with a disability are formally  instructed on the safest and least humiliating means of carrying.  ``Manifestly exceptional'' cases in which carrying would be permitted  might include, for example, programs conducted in unique facilities,  such as an oceanographic vessel, for which structural changes and  devices necessary to adapt the facility for use by individuals with  mobility impairments are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.  Carrying is not permitted as an alternative to structural modifications  such as installation of a ramp or a chairlift.</p><p class="depth0">In choosing among methods, the public entity shall give priority  consideration to those that will be consistent with provision of  services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of  individuals with disabilities. Structural changes in existing facilities  are required only when there is no other feasible way to make the public  entity's program accessible. (It should be noted that ``structural  changes'' include all physical changes to a facility; the term does not  refer only to changes to structural features, such as removal of or  alteration to a load-bearing structural member.) The requirements of  Sec.  35.151 for alterations apply to structural changes undertaken to  comply with this section. The public entity may comply with the program  accessibility requirement by delivering services at alternate accessible  sites or making home visits as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">Historic Preservation Programs</p><p class="depth0">In order to avoid possible conflict between the congressional  mandates to preserve historic properties, on the one hand, and to  eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities on the  other, paragraph (a)(2) provides that a public entity is not required to  take any action that would threaten or destroy the historic significance  of an historic property. The special limitation on program accessibility  set forth in paragraph (a)(2) is applicable only to historic  preservation programs, as defined in Sec.  35.104, that is, programs  that have preservation of historic properties as a primary purpose.  Narrow application of the special limitation is justified because of the  inherent flexibility of the program accessibility requirement. Where  historic preservation is not a primary purpose of the program, the  public entity is not required to use a particular facility. It can  relocate all or part of its program to an accessible facility, make home  visits, or use other standard methods of achieving program accessibility  without making structural alterations that might threaten or destroy  significant historic features of the historic   property. Thus, government programs located in historic properties, such  as an historic State capitol, are not excused from the requirement for  program access.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (a)(2), therefore, will apply only to those programs that  uniquely concern the preservation and experience of the historic  property itself. Because the primary benefit of an historic preservation  program is the experience of the historic property, paragraph (b)(2)  requires the public entity to give priority to methods of providing  program accessibility that permit individuals with disabilities to have  physical access to the historic property. This priority on physical  access may also be viewed as a specific application of the general  requirement that the public entity administer programs in the most  integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals  with disabilities (Sec.  35.130(d)). Only when providing physical access  would threaten or destroy the historic significance of an historic  property, or would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of  the program or in undue financial and administrative burdens, may the  public entity adopt alternative methods for providing program  accessibility that do not ensure physical access. Examples of some  alternative methods are provided in paragraph (b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Time Periods</p><p class="depth0">Paragraphs (c) and (d) establish time periods for complying with the  program accessibility requirement. Like the regulations for federally  assisted programs (e.g., 28 CFR 41.57(b)), paragraph (c) requires the  public entity to make any necessary structural changes in facilities as  soon as practicable, but in no event later than three years after the  effective date of this regulation.</p><p class="depth0">The proposed rule provided that, aside from structural changes, all  other necessary steps to achieve compliance with this part must be taken  within sixty days. The sixty day period was taken from regulations  implementing section 504, which generally were effective no more than  thirty days after publication. Because this regulation will not be  effective until January 26, 1992, the Department has concluded that no  additional transition period for non-structural changes is necessary, so  the sixty day period has been omitted in the final rule. Of course, this  section does not reduce or eliminate any obligations that are already  applicable to a public entity under section 504.</p><p class="depth0">Where structural modifications are required, paragraph (d) requires  that a transition plan be developed by an entity that employs 50 or more  persons, within six months of the effective date of this regulation. The  legislative history of title II of the ADA makes it clear that, under  title II, ``local and state governments are required to provide curb  cuts on public streets.'' Education and Labor report at 84. As the  rationale for the provision of curb cuts, the House report explains,  ``The employment, transportation, and public accommodation sections of *  * * (the ADA) would be meaningless if people who use wheelchairs were  not afforded the opportunity to travel on and between the streets.'' Id.  Section 35.151(e), which establishes accessibility requirements for new  construction and alterations, requires that all newly constructed or  altered streets, roads, or highways must contain curb ramps or other  sloped areas at any intersection having curbs or other barriers to entry  from a street level pedestrian walkway, and all newly constructed or  altered street level pedestrian walkways must have curb ramps or other  sloped areas at intersections to streets, roads, or highways. A new  paragraph (d)(2) has been added to the final rule to clarify the  application of the general requirement for program accessibility to the  provision of curb cuts at existing crosswalks. This paragraph requires  that the transition plan include a schedule for providing curb ramps or  other sloped areas at existing pedestrian walkways, giving priority to  walkways serving entities covered by the Act, including State and local  government offices and facilities, transportation, public  accommodations, and employers, followed by walkways serving other areas.  Pedestrian ``walkways'' include locations where access is required for  use of public transportation, such as bus stops that are not located at  intersections or crosswalks.</p><p class="depth0">Similarly, a public entity should provide an adequate number of  accessible parking spaces in existing parking lots or garages over which  it has jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (d)(3) provides that, if a public entity has already  completed a transition plan required by a regulation implementing  section 504, the transition plan required by this part will apply only  to those policies and practices that were not covered by the previous  transition plan. Some commenters suggested that the transition plan  should include all aspects of the public entity's operations, including  those that may have been covered by a previous transition plan under  section 504. The Department believes that such a duplicative requirement  would be inappropriate. Many public entities may find, however, that it  will be simpler to include all of their operations in the transition  plan than to attempt to identify and exclude specifically those that  were addressed in a previous plan. Of course, entities covered under  section 504 are not shielded from their obligations under that statute  merely because they are included under the transition plan developed  under this section.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151 New Construction and Alterations</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151 provides that those buildings that are constructed or  altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall be  designed, constructed, or altered to be readily accessible to and usable  by individuals with disabilities if the construction was commenced after  the effective date of this part. Facilities under design on that date  will be governed by this section if the date that bids were invited  falls after the effective date. This interpretation is consistent with  Federal practice under section 504.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(c) establishes two standards for accessible new  construction and alteration. Under paragraph (c), design, construction,  or alteration of facilities in conformance with the Uniform Federal  Accessibility Standards (UFAS) or with the Americans with Disabilities  Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (hereinafter  ADAAG) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section  with respect to those facilities except that, if ADAAG is chosen, the  elevator exemption contained at Sec. Sec.  36.40l(d) and 36.404 does not  apply. ADAAG is the standard for private buildings and was issued as  guidelines by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance  Board (ATBCB) under title III of the ADA. It has been adopted by the  Department of Justice and is published as appendix A to the Department's  title III rule in today's Federal Register. Departures from particular  requirements of these standards by the use of other methods shall be  permitted when it is clearly evident that equivalent access to the  facility or part of the facility is thereby provided. Use of two  standards is a departure from the proposed rule.</p><p class="depth0">The proposed rule adopted UFAS as the only interim accessibility  standard because that standard was referenced by the regulations  implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act promulgated by most  Federal funding agencies. It is, therefore, familiar to many State and  local government entities subject to this rule. The Department, however,  received many comments objecting to the adoption of UFAS. Commenters  pointed out that, except for the elevator exemption, UFAS is not as  stringent as ADAAG. Others suggested that the standard should be the  same to lessen confusion.</p><p class="depth0">Section 204(b) of the Act states that title II regulations must be  consistent not only with section 504 regulations but also with ``this  Act.'' Based on this provision, the Department has determined that a  public entity should be entitled to choose to comply either with ADAAG  or UFAS.</p><p class="depth0">Public entities who choose to follow ADAAG, however, are not  entitled to the elevator exemption contained in title III of the Act and  implemented in the title III regulation at Sec.  36.401(d) for new  construction and Sec.  36.404 for alterations. Section 303(b) of title  III states that, with some exceptions, elevators are not required in  facilities that are less than three stories or have less than 3000  square feet per story. The section 504 standard, UFAS, contains no such  exemption. Section 501 of the ADA makes clear that nothing in the Act  may be construed to apply a lesser standard to public entities than the  standards applied under section 504. Because permitting the elevator  exemption would clearly result in application of a lesser standard than  that applied under section 504, paragraph (c) states that the elevator  exemption does not apply when public entities choose to follow ADAAG.  Thus, a two-story courthouse, whether built according to UFAS or ADAAG,  must be constructed with an elevator. It should be noted that Congress  did not include an elevator exemption for public transit facilities  covered by subtitle B of title II, which covers public transportation  provided by public entities, providing further evidence that Congress  intended that public buildings have elevators.</p><p class="depth0">Section 504 of the ADA requires the ATBCB to issue supplemental  Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible Design of buildings  and facilities subject to the Act, including title II. Section 204(c) of  the ADA provides that the Attorney General shall promulgate regulations  implementing title II that are consistent with the ATBCB's ADA  guidelines. The ATBCB has announced its intention to issue title II  guidelines in the future. The Department anticipates that, after the  ATBCB's title II guidelines have been published, this rule will be  amended to adopt new accessibility standards consistent with the ATBCB's  rulemaking. Until that time, however, public entities will have a choice  of following UFAS or ADAAG, without the elevator exemption.</p><p class="depth0">Existing buildings leased by the public entity after the effective  date of this part are not required by the regulation to meet  accessibility standards simply by virtue of being leased. They are  subject, however, to the program accessibility standard for existing  facilities in Sec.  35.150. To the extent the buildings are newly  constructed or altered, they must also meet the new construction and  alteration requirements of Sec.  35.151.</p><p class="depth0">The Department received many comments urging that the Department  require that public entities lease only accessible buildings. Federal  practice under section 504 has always treated newly leased buildings as  subject to the existing facility program accessibility standard. Section  204(b) of the Act states that, in the area of ``program accessibility,  existing facilities,'' the title II regulations must be consistent with  section 504 regulations. Thus, the Department has adopted the section  504 principles for these   types of leased buildings. Unlike the construction of new buildings  where architectural barriers can be avoided at little or no cost, the  application of new construction standards to an existing building being  leased raises the same prospect of retrofitting buildings as the use of  an existing Federal facility, and the same program accessibility  standard should apply to both owned and leased existing buildings.  Similarly, requiring that public entities only lease accessible space  would significantly restrict the options of State and local governments  in seeking leased space, which would be particularly burdensome in rural  or sparsely populated areas.</p><p class="depth0">On the other hand, the more accessible the leased space is, the  fewer structural modifications will be required in the future for  particular employees whose disabilities may necessitate barrier removal  as a reasonable accommodation. Pursuant to the requirements for leased  buildings contained in the Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for  Accessible Design published under the Architectural Barriers Act by the  ATBCB, 36 CFR 1190.34, the Federal Government may not lease a building  unless it contains (1) One accessible route from an accessible entrance  to those areas in which the principal activities for which the building  is leased are conducted, (2) accessible toilet facilities, and (3)  accessible parking facilities, if a parking area is included within the  lease (36 CFR 1190.34). Although these requirements are not applicable  to buildings leased by public entities covered by this regulation, such  entities are encouraged to look for the most accessible space available  to lease and to attempt to find space complying at least with these  minimum Federal requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.151(d) gives effect to the intent of Congress, expressed  in section 504(c) of the Act, that this part recognize the national  interest in preserving significant historic structures. Commenters  criticized the Department's use of descriptive terms in the proposed  rule that are different from those used in the ADA to describe eligible  historic properties. In addition, some commenters criticized the  Department's decision to use the concept of ``substantially impairing''  the historic features of a property, which is a concept employed in  regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Those commenters recommended that the Department adopt the criteria of  ``adverse effect'' published by the Advisory Council on Historic  Preservation under the National Historic Preservation Act, 36 CFR 800.9,  as the standard for determining whether an historic property may be  altered.</p><p class="depth0">The Department agrees with these comments to the extent that they  suggest that the language of the rule should conform to the language  employed by Congress in the ADA. A definition of ``historic property,''  drawn from section 504 of the ADA, has been added to Sec.  35.104 to  clarify that the term applies to those properties listed or eligible for  listing in the National Register of Historic Places, or properties  designated as historic under State or local law.</p><p class="depth0">The Department intends that the exception created by this section be  applied only in those very rare situations in which it is not possible  to provide access to an historic property using the special access  provisions established by UFAS and ADAAG. Therefore, paragraph (d)(1) of  Sec.  35.151 has been revised to clearly state that alterations to  historic properties shall comply, to the maximum extent feasible, with  section 4.1.7 of UFAS or section 4.1.7 of ADAAG. Paragraph (d)(2) has  been revised to provide that, if it has been determined under the  procedures established in UFAS and ADAAG that it is not feasible to  provide physical access to an historic property in a manner that will  not threaten or destroy the historic significance of the property,  alternative methods of access shall be provided pursuant to the  requirements of Sec.  35.150.</p><p class="depth0">In response to comments, the Department has added to the final rule  a new paragraph (e) setting out the requirements of Sec.  36.151 as  applied to curb ramps. Paragraph (e) is taken from the statement  contained in the preamble to the proposed rule that all newly  constructed or altered streets, roads, and highways must contain curb  ramps at any intersection having curbs or other barriers to entry from a  street level pedestrian walkway, and that all newly constructed or  altered street level pedestrian walkways must have curb ramps at  intersections to streets, roads, or highways.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart E--Communications</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.160 General</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.160 requires the public entity to take such steps as may  be necessary to ensure that communications with applicants,  participants, and members of the public with disabilities are as  effective as communications with others.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(1) requires the public entity to furnish appropriate  auxiliary aids and services when necessary to afford an individual with  a disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the  benefits of, the public entity's service, program, or activity. The  public entity must provide an opportunity for individuals with  disabilities to request the auxiliary aids and services of their choice.  This expressed choice shall be given primary consideration by the public  entity (Sec.  35.160(b)(2)). The public entity shall honor the choice  unless it can demonstrate that another effective means of communication  exists or that use of the means chosen would not be required under Sec.   35.164.</p><p class="depth0">Deference to the request of the individual with a disability is  desirable because of the range of disabilities, the variety of auxiliary  aids and services, and different circumstances requiring effective  communication. For instance, some courtrooms are now equipped for  ``computer-assisted transcripts,'' which allow virtually instantaneous  transcripts of courtroom argument and testimony to appear on displays.  Such a system might be an effective auxiliary aid or service for a  person who is deaf or has a hearing loss who uses speech to communicate,  but may be useless for someone who uses sign language.</p><p class="depth0">Although in some circumstances a notepad and written materials may  be sufficient to permit effective communication, in other circumstances  they may not be sufficient. For example, a qualified interpreter may be  necessary when the information being communicated is complex, or is  exchanged for a lengthy period of time. Generally, factors to be  considered in determining whether an interpreter is required include the  context in which the communication is taking place, the number of people  involved, and the importance of the communication.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters asked that the rule clarify that the provision of  readers is sometimes necessary to ensure access to a public entity's  services, programs or activities. Reading devices or readers should be  provided when necessary for equal participation and opportunity to  benefit from any governmental service, program, or activity, such as  reviewing public documents, examining demonstrative evidence, and  filling out voter registration forms or forms needed to receive public  benefits. The importance of providing qualified readers for examinations  administered by public entities is discussed under Sec.  35.130. Reading  devices and readers are appropriate auxiliary aids and services where  necessary to permit an individual with a disability to participate in or  benefit from a service, program, or activity.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.160(b)(2) of the proposed rule, which provided that a  public entity need not furnish individually prescribed devices, readers  for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature, has  been deleted in favor of a new section in the final rule on personal  devices and services (see Sec.  35.135).</p><p class="depth0">In response to comments, the term ``auxiliary aids and services'' is  used in place of ``auxiliary aids'' in the final rule. This phrase  better reflects the range of aids and services that may be required  under this section.</p><p class="depth0">A number of comments raised questions about the extent of a public  entity's obligation to provide access to television programming for  persons with hearing impairments. Television and videotape programming  produced by public entities are covered by this section. Access to audio  portions of such programming may be provided by closed captioning.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.161 Telecommunication Devices for the Deaf (TDD's)</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.161 requires that, where a public entity communicates  with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, TDD's or equally  effective telecommunication systems be used to communicate with  individuals with impaired speech or hearing.</p><p class="depth0">Problems arise when a public entity which does not have a TDD needs  to communicate with an individual who uses a TDD or vice versa. Title IV  of the ADA addresses this problem by requiring establishment of  telephone relay services to permit communications between individuals  who communicate by TDD and individuals who communicate by the telephone  alone. The relay services required by title IV would involve a relay  operator using both a standard telephone and a TDD to type the voice  messages to the TDD user and read the TDD messages to the standard  telephone user.</p><p class="depth0">Section 204(b) of the ADA requires that the regulation implementing  title II with respect to communications be consistent with the  Department's regulation implementing section 504 for its federally  conducted programs and activities at 28 CFR part 39. Section 35.161,  which is taken from Sec.  39.160(a)(2) of that regulation, requires the  use of TDD's or equally effective telecommunication systems for  communication with people who use TDD's. Of course, where relay  services, such as those required by title IV of the ADA are available, a  public entity may use those services to meet the requirements of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters were concerned that public entities should not rely  heavily on the establishment of relay services. The commenters explained  that while relay services would be of vast benefit to both public  entities and individuals who use TDD's, the services are not sufficient  to provide access to all telephone services. First, relay systems do not  provide effective access to the increasingly popular automated systems  that require the caller to respond by pushing a button on a touch tone  phone. Second, relay systems cannot operate fast enough to convey  messages on answering machines, or to permit a TDD user to leave a  recorded message. Third, communication through relay systems may not be  appropriate in cases of crisis lines pertaining to rape, domestic  violence, child abuse, and drugs. The Department believes that it is  more appropriate for the Federal Communications Commission to address  these issues in its rulemaking under title IV.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters requested that those entities with frequent contacts  with clients who use TDD's have on-site TDD's to provide for direct  communication between the entity   and the individual. The Department encourages those entities that have  extensive telephone contact with the public such as city halls, public  libraries, and public aid offices, to have TDD's to insure more  immediate access. Where the provision of telephone service is a major  function of the entity, TDD's should be available.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.162 Telephone Emergency Services</p><p class="depth0">Many public entities provide telephone emergency services by which  individuals can seek immediate assistance from police, fire, ambulance,  and other emergency services. These telephone emergency services-- including ``911'' services--are clearly an important public service  whose reliability can be a matter of life or death. The legislative  history of title II specifically reflects congressional intent that  public entities must ensure that telephone emergency services, including  911 services, be accessible to persons with impaired hearing and speech  through telecommunication technology (Conference report at 67; Education  and Labor report at 84-85).</p><p class="depth0">Proposed Sec.  35.162 mandated that public entities provide  emergency telephone services to persons with disabilities that are  ``functionally equivalent'' to voice services provided to others. Many  commenters urged the Department to revise the section to make clear that  direct access to telephone emergency services is required by title II of  the ADA as indicated by the legislative history (Conference report at  67-68; Education and Labor report at 85). In response, the final rule  mandates ``direct access,'' instead of ``access that is functionally  equivalent'' to that provided to all other telephone users. Telephone  emergency access through a third party or through a relay service would  not satisfy the requirement for direct access.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters asked about a separate seven-digit emergency call  number for the 911 services. The requirement for direct access disallows  the use of a separate seven-digit number where 911 service is available.  Separate seven-digit emergency call numbers would be unfamiliar to many  individuals and also more burdensome to use. A standard emergency 911  number is easier to remember and would save valuable time spent in  searching in telephone books for a local seven-digit emergency number.</p><p class="depth0">Many commenters requested the establishment of minimum standards of  service (e.g., the quantity and location of TDD's and computer modems  needed in a given emergency center). Instead of establishing these  scoping requirements, the Department has established a performance  standard through the mandate for direct access.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.162 requires public entities to take appropriate steps,  including equipping their emergency systems with modern technology, as  may be necessary to promptly receive and respond to a call from users of  TDD's and computer modems. Entities are allowed the flexibility to  determine what is the appropriate technology for their particular needs.  In order to avoid mandating use of particular technologies that may  become outdated, the Department has eliminated the references to the  Baudot and ASCII formats in the proposed rule.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters requested that the section require the installation  of a voice amplification device on the handset of the dispatcher's  telephone to amplify the dispatcher's voice. In an emergency, a person  who has a hearing loss may be using a telephone that does not have an  amplification device. Installation of speech amplification devices on  the handsets of the dispatchers' telephones would respond to that  situation. The Department encourages their use.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters emphasized the need for proper maintenance of  TDD's used in telephone emergency services. Section 35.133, which  mandates maintenance of accessible features, requires public entities to  maintain in operable working condition TDD's and other devices that  provide direct access to the emergency system.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.163 Information and Signage</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.163(a) requires the public entity to provide information  to individuals with disabilities concerning accessible services,  activities, and facilities. Paragraph (b) requires the public entity to  provide signage at all inaccessible entrances to each of its facilities  that directs users to an accessible entrance or to a location with  information about accessible facilities.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters requested that, where TDD-equipped pay phones or  portable TDD's exist, clear signage should be posted indicating the  location of the TDD. The Department believes that this is required by  paragraph (a). In addition, the Department recommends that, in large  buildings that house TDD's, directional signage indicating the location  of available TDD's should be placed adjacent to banks of telephones that  do not contain a TDD.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.164 Duties</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.164, like paragraph (a)(3) of Sec.  35.150, is taken from  the section 504 regulations for federally conducted programs. Like  paragraph (a)(3), it limits the obligation of the public entity to  ensure effective communication in accordance with Davis and the circuit  court opinions interpreting it. It also includes specific requirements  for determining the existence of undue financial and administrative  burdens. The preamble discussion of Sec.  35.150(a) regarding that  determination is applicable to this section and further explains the  public entity's obligation to comply with Sec. Sec.  35.160-35.164.  Because   of the essential nature of the services provided by telephone emergency  systems, the Department assumes that Sec.  35.164 will rarely be applied  to Sec.  35.162.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart F--Compliance Procedures</p><p class="depth0">Subpart F sets out the procedures for administrative enforcement of  this part. Section 203 of the Act provides that the remedies,  procedures, and rights set forth in section 505 of the Rehabilitation  Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794a) for enforcement of section 504 of the  Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of  handicap in programs and activities that receive Federal financial  assistance, shall be the remedies, procedures, and rights for  enforcement of title II. Section 505, in turn, incorporates by reference  the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil  Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d to 2000d-4a). Title VI, which  prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin  in federally assisted programs, is enforced by the Federal agencies that  provide the Federal financial assistance to the covered programs and  activities in question. If voluntary compliance cannot be achieved,  Federal agencies enforce title VI either by the termination of Federal  funds to a program that is found to discriminate, following an  administrative hearing, or by a referral to this Department for judicial  enforcement.</p><p class="depth0">Title II of the ADA extended the requirements of section 504 to all  services, programs, and activities of State and local governments, not  only those that receive Federal financial assistance. The House  Committee on Education and Labor explained the enforcement provisions as  follows:</p><p class="depth0">It is the Committee's intent that administrative enforcement of  section 202 of the legislation should closely parallel the Federal  government's experience with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of  1973. The Attorney General should use section 504 enforcement procedures  and the Department's coordination role under Executive Order 12250 as  models for regulation in this area.</p><p class="depth0">The Committee envisions that the Department of Justice will identify  appropriate Federal agencies to oversee compliance activities for State  and local governments. As with section 504, these Federal agencies,  including the Department of Justice, will receive, investigate, and  where possible, resolve complaints of discrimination. If a Federal  agency is unable to resolve a complaint by voluntary means, * * * the  major enforcement sanction for the Federal government will be referral  of cases by these Federal agencies to the Department of Justice.</p><p class="depth0">The Department of Justice may then proceed to file suits in Federal  district court. As with section 504, there is also a private right of  action for persons with disabilities, which includes the full panoply of  remedies. Again, consistent with section 504, it is not the Committee's  intent that persons with disabilities need to exhaust Federal  administrative remedies before exercising their private right of action.  Education & Labor report at 98. See also S. Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong.,  1st Sess., at 57-58 (1989).</p><p class="depth0">Subpart F effectuates the congressional intent by deferring to  section 504 procedures where those procedures are applicable, that is,  where a Federal agency has jurisdiction under section 504 by virtue of  its provision of Federal financial assistance to the program or activity  in which the discrimination is alleged to have occurred. Deferral to the  504 procedures also makes the sanction of fund termination available  where necessary to achieve compliance. Because the Civil Rights  Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-259) extended the application of section  504 to all of the operations of the public entity receiving the Federal  financial assistance, many activities of State and local governments are  already covered by section 504. The procedures in subpart F apply to  complaints concerning services, programs, and activities of public  entities that are covered by the ADA.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart G designates the Federal agencies responsible for enforcing  the ADA with respect to specific components of State and local  government. It does not, however, displace existing jurisdiction under  section 504 of the various funding agencies. Individuals may still file  discrimination complaints against recipients of Federal financial  assistance with the agencies that provide that assistance, and the  funding agencies will continue to process those complaints under their  existing procedures for enforcing section 504. The substantive standards  adopted in this part for title II of the ADA are generally the same as  those required under section 504 for federally assisted programs, and  public entities covered by the ADA are also covered by the requirements  of section 504 to the extent that they receive Federal financial  assistance. To the extent that title II provides greater protection to  the rights of individuals with disabilities, however, the funding  agencies will also apply the substantive requirements established under  title II and this part in processing complaints covered by both this  part and section 504, except that fund termination procedures may be  used only for violations of section 504.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart F establishes the procedures to be followed by the agencies  designated in subpart G for processing complaints against State and  local government entities when the designated agency does not have  jurisdiction under section 504.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.170 Complaints</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.170 provides that any individual who believes that he or  she or a specific class of individuals has been subjected to  discrimination on the basis of disability by a public entity may, by  himself or herself or by an authorized representative, file a complaint  under this part within 180 days of the date of the alleged  discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the agency for  good cause. Although Sec.  35.107 requires public entities that employ  50 or more persons to establish grievance procedures for resolution of  complaints, exhaustion of those procedures is not a prerequisite to  filing a complaint under this section. If a complainant chooses to  follow the public entity's grievance procedures, however, any resulting  delay may be considered good cause for extending the time allowed for  filing a complaint under this part.</p><p class="depth0">Filing the complaint with any Federal agency will satisfy the  requirement for timely filing. As explained below, a complaint filed  with an agency that has jurisdiction under section 504 will be processed  under the agency's procedures for enforcing section 504.</p><p class="depth0">Some commenters objected to the complexity of allowing complaints to  be filed with different agencies. The multiplicity of enforcement  jurisdiction is the result of following the statutorily mandated  enforcement scheme. The Department has, however, attempted to simplify  procedures for complainants by making the Federal agency that receives  the complaint responsible for referring it to an appropriate agency.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has also added a new paragraph (c) to this section  providing that a complaint may be filed with any agency designated under  subpart G of this part, or with any agency that provides funding to the  public entity that is the subject of the complaint, or with the  Department of Justice. Under Sec.  35.171(a)(2), the Department of  Justice will refer complaints for which it does not have jurisdiction  under section 504 to an agency that does have jurisdiction under section  504, or to the agency designated under subpart G as responsible for  complaints filed against the public entity that is the subject of the  complaint or in the case of an employment complaint that is also subject  to title I of the Act, to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  Complaints filed with the Department of Justice may be sent to the  Coordination and Review Section, P.O. Box 66118, Civil Rights Division,  U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20035-6118.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.171 Acceptance of Complaints</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.171 establishes procedures for determining jurisdiction  and responsibility for processing complaints against public entities.  The final rule provides complainants an opportunity to file with the  Federal funding agency of their choice. If that agency does not have  jurisdiction under section 504, however, and is not the agency  designated under subpart G as responsible for that public entity, the  agency must refer the complaint to the Department of Justice, which will  be responsible for referring it either to an agency that does have  jurisdiction under section 504 or to the appropriate designated agency,  or in the case of an employment complaint that is also subject to title  I of the Act, to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p><p class="depth0">Whenever an agency receives a complaint over which it has  jurisdiction under section 504, it will process the complaint under its  section 504 procedures. When the agency designated under subpart G  receives a complaint for which it does not have jurisdiction under  section 504, it will treat the complaint as an ADA complaint under the  procedures established in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.171 also describes agency responsibilities for the  processing of employment complaints. As described in connection with  Sec.  35.140, additional procedures regarding the coordination of  employment complaints will be established in a coordination regulation  issued by DOJ and EEOC. Agencies with jurisdiction under section 504 for  complaints alleging employment discrimination also covered by title I  will follow the procedures established by the coordination regulation  for those complaints. Complaints covered by title I but not section 504  will be referred to the EEOC, and complaints covered by this part but  not title I will be processed under the procedures in this part.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.172 Resolution of Complaints</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.172 requires the designated agency to either resolve the  complaint or issue to the complainant and the public entity a Letter of  Findings containing findings of fact and conclusions of law and a  description of a remedy for each violation found.</p><p class="depth0">The Act requires the Department of Justice to establish  administrative procedures for resolution of complaints, but does not  require complainants to exhaust these administrative remedies. The  Committee Reports make clear that Congress intended to provide a private  right of action with the full panoply of remedies for individual victims  of discrimination. Because the Act does not require exhaustion of  administrative remedies, the complainant may elect to proceed with a  private suit at any time.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.173 Voluntary Compliance Agreements</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.173 requires the agency to attempt to resolve all  complaints in which it   finds noncompliance through voluntary compliance agreements enforceable  by the Attorney General.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.174 Referral</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.174 provides for referral of the matter to the Department  of Justice if the agency is unable to obtain voluntary compliance.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.175 Attorney's Fees</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.175 states that courts are authorized to award attorneys  fees, including litigation expenses and costs, as provided in section  505 of the Act. Litigation expenses include items such as expert witness  fees, travel expenses, etc. The Judiciary Committee Report specifies  that such items are included under the rubric of ``attorneys fees'' and  not ``costs'' so that such expenses will be assessed against a plaintiff  only under the standard set forth in Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission, 434 U.S. 412 (1978). (Judiciary  report at 73.)</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.176 Alternative Means of Dispute Resolution</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.176 restates section 513 of the Act, which encourages use  of alternative means of dispute resolution.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.177 Effect of Unavailability of Technical Assistance</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.177 explains that, as provided in section 506(e) of the  Act, a public entity is not excused from compliance with the  requirements of this part because of any failure to receive technical  assistance.</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.178 State Immunity</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.178 restates the provision of section 502 of the Act that  a State is not immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution  of the United States from an action in Federal or State court for  violations of the Act, and that the same remedies are available for any  such violations as are available in an action against an entity other  than a State.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart G--Designated Agencies</p><p class="depth0">Section 35.190 Designated Agencies</p><p class="depth0">Subpart G designates the Federal agencies responsible for  investigating complaints under this part. At least 26 agencies currently  administer programs of Federal financial assistance that are subject to  the nondiscrimination requirements of section 504 as well as other civil  rights statutes. A majority of these agencies administer modest programs  of Federal financial assistance and/or devote minimal resources  exclusively to ``external'' civil rights enforcement activities. Under  Executive Order 12250, the Department of Justice has encouraged the use  of delegation agreements under which certain civil rights compliance  responsibilities for a class of recipients funded by more than one  agency are delegated by an agency or agencies to a ``lead'' agency. For  example, many agencies that fund institutions of higher education have  signed agreements that designate the Department of Education as the  ``lead'' agency for this class of recipients.</p><p class="depth0">The use of delegation agreements reduces overlap and duplication of  effort, and thereby strengthens overall civil rights enforcement.  However, the use of these agreements to date generally has been limited  to education and health care recipients. These classes of recipients are  funded by numerous agencies and the logical connection to a lead agency  is clear (e.g., the Department of Education for colleges and  universities, and the Department of Health and Human Services for  hospitals).</p><p class="depth0">The ADA's expanded coverage of State and local government operations  further complicates the process of establishing Federal agency  jurisdiction for the purpose of investigating complaints of  discrimination on the basis of disability. Because all operations of  public entities now are covered irrespective of the presence or absence  of Federal financial assistance, many additional State and local  government functions and organizations now are subject to Federal  jurisdiction. In some cases, there is no historical or single clear-cut  subject matter relationship with a Federal agency as was the case in the  education example described above. Further, the 33,000 governmental  jurisdictions subject to the ADA differ greatly in their organization,  making a detailed and workable division of Federal agency jurisdiction  by individual State, county, or municipal entity unrealistic.</p><p class="depth0">This regulation applies the delegation concept to the investigation  of complaints of discrimination on the basis of disability by public  entities under the ADA. It designates eight agencies, rather than all  agencies currently administering programs of Federal financial  assistance, as responsible for investigating complaints under this part.  These ``designated agencies'' generally have the largest civil rights  compliance staffs, the most experience in complaint investigations and  disability issues, and broad yet clear subject area responsibilities.  This division of responsibilities is made functionally rather than by  public entity type or name designation. For example, all entities  (regardless of their title) that exercise responsibilities, regulate, or  administer services or programs relating to lands and natural resources  fall within the jurisdiction of the Department of Interior.</p><p class="depth0">Complaints under this part will be investigated by the designated  agency most closely related to the functions exercised by the  governmental component against which the complaint is lodged. For  example, a complaint against a State medical board, where such a board  is a recognizable entity, will be investigated by the Department of  Health and Human Services (the designated agency for regulatory  activities relating to the provision of health care), even if the board  is part of a general umbrella department of planning and regulation (for  which the Department of Justice is the designated agency). If two or  more agencies have apparent responsibility over a complaint, Sec.   35.190(c) provides that the Assistant Attorney General shall determine  which one of the agencies shall be the designated agency for purposes of  that complaint.</p><p class="depth0">Thirteen commenters, including four proposed designated agencies,  addressed the Department of Justice's identification in the proposed  regulation of nine ``designated agencies'' to investigate complaints  under this part. Most comments addressed the proposed specific  delegations to the various individual agencies. The Department of  Justice agrees with several commenters who pointed out that  responsibility for ``historic and cultural preservation'' functions  appropriately belongs with the Department of Interior rather than the  Department of Education. The Department of Justice also agrees with the  Department of Education that ``museums'' more appropriately should be  delegated to the Department of Interior, and that ``preschool and  daycare programs'' more appropriately should be assigned to the  Department of Health and Human Services, rather than to the Department  of Education. The final rule reflects these decisions.</p><p class="depth0">The Department of Commerce opposed its listing as the designated  agency for ``commerce and industry, including general economic  development, banking and finance, consumer protection, insurance, and  small business''. The Department of Commerce cited its lack of a  substantial existing section 504 enforcement program and experience with  many of the specific functions to be delegated. The Department of  Justice accedes to the Department of Commerce's position, and has  assigned itself as the designated agency for these functions.</p><p class="depth0">In response to a comment from the Department of Health and Human  Services, the regulation's category of ``medical and nursing schools''  has been clarified to read ``schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing,  and other health-related fields''. Also in response to a comment from  the Department of Health and Human Services, ``correctional  institutions'' have been specifically added to the public safety and  administration of justice functions assigned to the Department of  Justice.</p><p class="depth0">The regulation also assigns the Department of Justice as the  designated agency responsible for all State and local government  functions not assigned to other designated agencies. The Department of  Justice, under an agreement with the Department of the Treasury,  continues to receive and coordinate the investigation of complaints  filed under the Revenue Sharing Act. This entitlement program, which was  terminated in 1986, provided civil rights compliance jurisdiction for a  wide variety of complaints regarding the use of Federal funds to support  various general activities of local governments. In the absence of any  similar program of Federal financial assistance administered by another  Federal agency, placement of designated agency responsibilities for  miscellaneous and otherwise undesignated functions with the Department  of Justice is an appropriate continuation of current practice.</p><p class="depth0">The Department of Education objected to the proposed rule's  inclusion of the functional area of ``arts and humanities'' within its  responsibilities, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development  objected to its proposed designation as responsible for activities  relating to rent control, the real estate industry, and housing code  enforcement. The Department has deleted these areas from the lists  assigned to the Departments of Education and Housing and Urban  Development, respectively, and has added a new paragraph (c) to Sec.   35.190, which provides that the Department of Justice may assign  responsibility for components of State or local governments that  exercise responsibilities, regulate, or administer services, programs,  or activities relating to functions not assigned to specific designated  agencies by paragraph (b) of this section to other appropriate agencies.  The Department believes that this approach will provide more flexibility  in determining the appropriate agency for investigation of complaints  involving those components of State and local governments not  specifically addressed by the listings in paragraph (b). As provided in  Sec. Sec.  35.170 and 35.171, complaints filed with the Department of  Justice will be referred to the appropriate agency.</p><p class="depth0">Several commenters proposed a stronger role for the Department of  Justice, especially with respect to the receipt and assignment of  complaints, and the overall monitoring of the effectiveness of the  enforcement activities of Federal agencies. As discussed above,  Sec. Sec.  35.170 and 35.171 have been revised to provide for referral  of complaints by the Department of Justice to appropriate enforcement  agencies. Also, language has been added to Sec.  35.190(a) of the final  regulation stating that the Assistant Attorney   General shall provide policy guidance and interpretations to designated  agencies to ensure the consistent and effective implementation of this  part.
