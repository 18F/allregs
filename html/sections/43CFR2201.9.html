Schurz, 102 U.S. 378 (1880), or any other law or ruling to the contrary, title to both the non-Federal and Federal lands simultaneously shall pass and be deemed accepted by the United States and the non-Federal landowner, respectively, when the documents of conveyance are recorded in the county clerk's or other local recorder's office. Before recordation, all instructions, requirements, and conditions set forth by the United States and the non-Federal landowner shall be met. The requirements and conditions necessary for recordation at a minimum will include the following, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The determination by the authorized officer that the United States will receive possession, acceptable to it, of such lands; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The issuance of title evidence as of the date and time of recordation, which conforms to the instructions and requirements of the Office of the Solicitor's preliminary title opinion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Automatic segregation of lands. Subject to valid existing rights, non-Federal lands acquired through exchange by the United States automatically shall be segregated from appropriation under the public land laws and mineral laws until midnight of the 90th day after acceptance of title by the United States, and the public land records shall be noted accordingly. Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, the lands shall be open to the operation of the public land laws and mineral laws at midnight 90 days after the day title was accepted unless otherwise segregated pursuant to part 2300 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice to State and local governments. Following the transfer of title to the Federal lands involved in an exchange, notice will be given to State and local officials as prescribed in Sec. 2200.0-6(m) of this part.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 2203_Exchanges Involving Fee Federal Coal Deposits</p><p class="depth2">Source: 51 FR 12612, Apr. 14, 1986, unless otherwise noted.</p>
