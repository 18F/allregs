                            <p class="depth0">Heads of field organizations shall ensure that provisions of the  FPMR concerning contractor use of Government motor vehicles are complied  with by their designated contractors.    Sec. 109-38.301-1.50  Authorization for transportation between residence and place of employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Government motor vehicles shall not be used for transportation  between residence and place of employment by designated contractor  personnel except under extenuating circumstances specifically provided  for under the terms of the contract. Examples of circumstances eligible  for prior approval of home-to-work motor vehicle use which would be  appropriate to include in the terms of the contract include: use related  to safety or security operations, use related to compelling operational  considerations, and use determined as cost effective to DOE's interest.  Under no circumstances shall the comfort and convenience, or managerial  position, of contractor employees be considered justification for  authorization of use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The use of Government motor vehicles for transportation between  residence and place of employment (including sporadic use) by designated  contractor personnel shall be approved in writing by the Head of the  field organization or designee, with delegation no lower than the  Assistant Manager for Administration at the Operations Offices or the  equivalent position at other DOE contracting activities provided that  the individual is a warranted contracting officer. The contractor's  request for approval shall include the name and title of the employee,  the reason for the use, and the expected duration of the use. Each  authorization is limited to one year, but can be extended for an  unlimited number of additional one-year periods.    Sec. 109-38.301-1.51  Emergency use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Procedures for authorization of designated contractor use of  Government motor vehicles in emergencies, including unscheduled overtime  situations at remote sites where prior approval is not possible, shall  be included in a contractor's approved property management procedures.  The procedures shall include examples of emergency situations warranting  such use. Records detailing instances of emergency use shall be  maintained and review of all such emergency or overtime use must be  certified through established audit procedures on at least an annual  basis by the OPMO.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In limiting the use of Government motor vehicles to official  purposes, it is not intended to preclude their use in emergencies  threatening loss of life or   property. Such use shall be documented and the documentation retained  for three years.    Sec. 109-38.301-1.52  Maintenance of records.</p><p class="depth0">Designated contractors shall maintain logs or other records on the  use of a Government motor vehicle for transportation between an  employee's residence and place of employment. As a minimum, these logs  shall indicate the employee's name, date of use, time of departure and  arrival, miles driven, and names of other passengers. Cognizant finance  offices shall be provided with applicable data on employees who utilize  Government motor vehicles for such transportation for purposes of the  Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 concerning the taxation of fringe  benefits.    Sec. 109-38.301-1.53  Responsibilities of motor vehicle operators.</p><p class="depth0">Designated contractors shall assure that their employees are aware  of their responsibilities, identical to those listed in Sec. 109-6.400- 50 of this chapter for DOE employees, concerning the use and operation  of Government motor vehicles.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 109	38.4_Use and Replacement Standards</p>
