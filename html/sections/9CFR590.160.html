                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Administrator (for such period, or indefinitely, as he deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Act) may refuse to provide or may withdraw inspection service under this part with respect to any plant if he determines after opportunity for a hearing (following the procedures of 7 CFR, part 1, subpart H) is accorded to the applicant for, or recipient of, such service, that such applicant or recipient is unfit to engage in any business requiring inspection under the Act or this part, because the applicant or recipient or anyone responsibly connected with such person has been convicted in any Federal or State court, within the previous 10 years, of (1) any felony or more than one misdemeanor under any law based upon the acquiring, handling, or distributing of adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged food or fraud in connection with transactions in food or (2) any felony, involving, fraud, bribery, extortion, or any other act or circumstances indicating a lack of the integrity needed for the conduct of operations affecting the public health.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purpose of this section, a person shall be deemed to be responsibly connected with the business if he is a partner, officer, director, holder, or owner of 10 percentum or more of its voting stock, or employee in a managerial or executive capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The determination and order of the Administrator with respect thereto under this section shall be final and conclusive unless the affected applicant for, or recipient of, inspection service files application for judicial review within 30 days after the effective date of such order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which such applicant or recipient has its principal place of business or in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Judicial review of any such order shall be upon the record upon which the determination and order are based. The provisions of section 204 of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, as amended (7 U.S.C. 194) shall be applicable to appeals taken under this section. This section shall not affect in any way other provisions of the Act or these regulations for refusal of inspection services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any applicant for inspection at a plant where the operations thereof may result in any discharge into the navigable waters in the United States is required by subsection 401(a)(1) (33 U.S.C. 1341) of the Clean Water Act as amended (86 Stat. 816, 91 Stat. 1566; 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), to provide the Administrator with a certification, as prescribed in said subsection, that any such discharge will comply with the

applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307 of the Act (33 U.S.C. 1311, 1312, 1313, 1316, and 1317). No grant of inspection can be issued unless such certification has been obtained, or is waived, because of failure or refusal of the State, interstate agency, or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to act on a request for certification within a reasonable period (which shall not exceed 1 year after receipt of such request). Further, upon receipt of an application for inspection and a certification as required by subsection 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, the Administrator (as defined in Sec. 590.5) is required by subparagraph (2) of said subsection to notify the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for proceedings in accordance with that subsection. No grant of inspection can be made until the requirements of 401(a) (1) and (2) have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Inspection may be suspended or revoked and plant approval terminated as provided in subsection 401(a) (4) and (5) of the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1341(a) (4) and (5)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Suspension of plant approval and withdrawal of service:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any plant approval given pursuant to these regulations may be suspended by the Administrator for (i) failure to maintain premises, facilities, and equipment in a satisfactory state of repair; (ii) the use of operating procedures or practices which are not in accordance with the regulations; (iii) the alterations of buildings, facilities, or equipment which have not been approved in accordance with the regulations; or (iv) assaulting, intimidating, impeding, obstructing, or interfering with any person engaged in or on account of the performance of his official duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During such period of suspension, no processing of egg products for commerce shall be carried on in the official plant. If the plant facilities or methods of operation are not brought into compliance within a reasonable period of time, to be specified by the Administrator, inspection service shall be withdrawn from the official plant. Upon withdrawal of inspection service in an official plant, the plant approval for processing egg products shall also become terminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The operator shall be notified of the withdrawal action and the reasons therefor and afforded an opportunity to present his views informally prior to the effective date of such withdrawal, and upon written request, he shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the applicable rules of practice (7 CFR, part 1, subpart H), with respect to the merits or validity of the withdrawal, but such a suspension or other withdrawal shall continue in effect pending the outcome of any such hearing unless otherwise ordered by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In any case where inspection service is suspended under this paragraph (f) of this section, such service, after appropriate corrective action is taken, will be restored immediately, or as soon thereafter as an inspector can be made available. In any case where inspection service is withdrawn for a specified period under this paragraph (f) of this section, the person concerned may, after said specified period has expired, apply for inspection service as provided in Sec. Sec. 590.140 through 590.146.
