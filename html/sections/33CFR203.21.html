                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Disaster preparedness is a basic tenet of State and local responsibility. Assistance provided under authority of Public Law 84-99 is intended to be supplemental to the maximum efforts of State and local interests. Assistance under Public Law 84-99 will not be provided when non-Federal interests have made insufficient efforts to address the situation for which assistance is requested. Assistance under Public Law 84-99 will not be provided when a request for such assistance is based entirely on a lack of fiscal resources with which to address the situation. Non-Federal interests' responsibilities are addressed in detail as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Operation and maintenance of flood control works. Flood control works must be operated and maintained by non-Federal interests. Maintenance includes both short-term activities (normally done on an annual cycle, or more frequently) such as vegetation control and control of burrowing animals, and longer term activities such as repair or replacement of structural components (e.g., culverts) of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procurement/stockpiling. Procurement and stockpiling of sandbags, pumps, and/or other materials or equipment that might be needed during flood situations is a non-Federal responsibility. The Corps is normally a last resort option for obtaining such materials. Local interests should request such materials from State assets prior to seeking Corps assistance. Local interests are responsible for reimbursing (either in kind or in cash) the Corps for expendable flood fight supplies and materials, and returning items such as pumps. When a flood is of sufficient magnitude to receive a Stafford Act emergency or disaster declaration, then the District Engineer may waive reimbursement of expendable supplies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Training and plans. Training personnel to operate, maintain, and patrol flood control projects during crisis situations is a non-Federal responsibility. Specific plans should be developed and in place to address known problem areas. For instance, the non-Federal sponsor of a levee reach prone to boils should have personnel specifically trained in flood fighting boils. In addition, contingency plans must be made when needed to address short term situations. For instance, if a culvert through a levee is being replaced, then the contingency plan should address all actions needed should a flood event occur during the construction period when levee integrity is lacking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Corps Rehabilitation and Inspection Program for Flood Control Works. To be eligible for Rehabilitation Assistance under Public Law 84-99, it is a non-Federal responsibility to take those actions necessary for flood control works to gain and maintain an Active status in the Corps Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP), as detailed in subpart D of this part.</p>
