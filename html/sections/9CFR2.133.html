                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(3)</em>  of this section that acquire any live dog or cat shall, before selling  or providing the live dog or cat to a dealer, hold and care for the dog  or cat for a period of not less than 5 full days after acquiring the  animal, not including the date of acquisition and excluding time in  transit. This holding period shall include at least one Saturday. The  provisions of this paragraph apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each pound or shelter owned and operated by a State, county, or  city;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each private pound or shelter established for the purpose of  caring for animals, such as a humane society, or other organization that  is under contract with a State, county, or city, that operates as a  pound or shelter, and that releases animals on a voluntary basis; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each research facility licensed by USDA as a dealer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A dealer shall not sell, provide, or make available to any  person a live random source dog or cat unless the dealer provides the  recipient of the dog or cat with certification that contains the  following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, USDA license number, and signature of the  dealer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name, address, USDA license or registration number, if such  number exists, and signature of the recipient of the dog or cat;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of each dog or cat being sold, provided, or made  available that shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The species and breed or type (for mixed breeds, estimate the  two dominant breeds or types);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sex;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date of birth or, if unknown, then the approximate age;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The color and any distinctive markings; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The Official USDA-approved identification number of the animal.  However, if the certification is attached to a certificate provided by a  prior dealer which contains the required description, then only the  official identification numbers are required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name and address of the person, pound, or shelter from which  the dog or cat was acquired by the dealer, and an assurance that the  person, pound, or shelter was notified that the cat or dog might be used  for research or educational purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The date the dealer acquired the dog or cat from the person,  pound, or shelter referred to in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the dealer acquired the dog or cat from a pound or shelter, a  signed statement by the pound or shelter that it met the requirements of  paragraph (a) of this section. This statement must at least describe the  animals by their official USDA identification numbers. It may be  incorporated within the certification if the dealer makes the  certification at the time that the animals are acquired from the pound  or shelter or it may be made separately and attached to the  certification later. If made separately, it must include the same  information describing each animal as is required in the certification.  A photocopy of the statement will be regarded as a duplicate original.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The original certification required under paragraph (b) of this  section shall accompany the shipment of a live dog or cat to be sold,  provided, or otherwise made available by the dealer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A dealer who acquires a live dog or cat from another dealer must  obtain from that dealer the certification required by paragraph (b) of  this section   and must attach that certification (including any previously attached  certification) to the certification which he or she provides pursuant to  paragraph (b) of this section (a photocopy of the original certification  will be deemed a duplicate original if the dealer does not dispose of  all of the dogs or cats in a single transaction).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A dealer who completes, provides, or receives a certification  required under paragraph (b) of this section shall keep, maintain, and  make available for APHIS inspection a copy of the certification for at  least 1 year following disposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A research facility which acquires any live random source dog or  cat from a dealer must obtain the certification required under paragraph  (b) of this section and shall keep, maintain, and make available for  APHIS inspection the original for at least 3 years following  disposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In instances where a research facility transfers ownership of a  live random source dog or cat acquired from a dealer to another research  facility, a copy of the certification required by paragraph (b) of this  section must accompany the dog or cat transferred. The research facility  to which the dog or cat is transferred shall keep, maintain, and make  available for APHIS inspection the copy of the certification for at  least 3 years following disposition.
