                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The manufacturer shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mark every IBC in a durable and clearly visible manner. The  marking may be applied in a single line or in multiple lines provided  the correct sequence is followed with the information required by this  section in letters, numerals and symbols of at least 12 mm in height.  This minimum marking size applies only to IBCs manufactured after  October 1, 2001). The following information is required in the sequence  presented:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>. For metal IBCs on which  the marking is stamped or embossed, the capital letters ``UN'' may be  applied instead of the symbol.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The code number designating IBC design type according to  Sec. 178.702(a). The letter ``W'' must follow the IBC design type  identification code on an IBC when the IBC differs from the requirements  in subpart N of this part, or is tested using methods other than those  specified in this subpart, and is approved by the Associate  Administrator in accordance with the provisions in Sec. 178.801(i).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A capital letter identifying the performance standard under  which the design type has been successfully tested, as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> X--for IBCs meeting Packing Group I, II and III tests;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Y--for IBCs meeting Packing Group II and III tests; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Z--for IBCs meeting only Packing Group III tests.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The month (designated numerically) and year (last two digits)  of manufacture.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The country authorizing the allocation of the mark. The letters  `USA' indicate that the IBC is manufactured and marked in the United  States in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The name and address or symbol of the manufacturer or the  approval agency certifying compliance with subparts N and O of this  part. Symbols, if used, must be registered with the Associate  Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The stacking test load in kilograms (kg). For IBCs not  designed for stacking, the figure ``0'' must be shown.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The maximum permissible gross mass in kg.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following are examples of symbols and required markings:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a metal IBC containing solids discharged by gravity made  from steel: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26JY94.000</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a flexible IBC containing solids discharged by gravity and  made from woven plastic with a liner: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26JY94.001</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For a rigid plastic IBC containing liquids, made from plastic  with structural equipment withstanding the stack load and with a  manufacturer's symbol in place of the manufacturer's name and address:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26JY94.002</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For a composite IBC containing liquids, with a rigid plastic  inner receptacle and an outer steel body and with the symbol of a DOT  approved third-party test laboratory: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26JY94.003</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional marking. In addition to markings required in  paragraph (a) of this section, each IBC must be marked as follows in a  place near the markings required in paragraph (a) of this section that  is readily accessible for inspection. Where units of measure are used,  the metric unit indicated (e.g., 450 L) must also appear.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each rigid plastic and composite IBC, the following markings  must be included:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Rated capacity in L of water at 20 C (68 F);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Tare mass in kilograms;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Gauge test pressure in kPa;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Date of last leakproofness test, if applicable (month and  year); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Date of last inspection (month and year).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each metal IBC, the following markings must be included on a  metal corrosion-resistant plate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Rated capacity in L of water at 20 C (68 F);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Tare mass in kilograms;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Date of last leakproofness test, if applicable (month and  year);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Date of last inspection (month and year);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Maximum loading/discharge pressure, in kPa, if applicable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Body material and its minimum thickness in mm; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Serial number assigned by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Markings required by paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section  may be preceded by the narrative description of the marking, e.g. ``Tare  Mass: * * *'' where the ``* * *'' are replaced with the tare mass in  kilograms of the IBC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each fiberboard and wooden IBC, the tare mass in kg must be  shown.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each flexible IBC may be marked with a pictogram displaying  recommended lifting methods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For each composite IBC, the inner receptacle must be marked with  at least the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The code number designating the IBC design type, the name and  address or symbol of the manufacturer, the date of manufacture and the  country authorizing the allocation of the mark as specified in paragraph  (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When a composite IBC is designed in such a manner that the  outer casing is intended to be dismantled for transport when empty (such  as, for the return of the IBC for reuse to the original consignor), each  of the parts intended to be detached when so dismantled must be marked  with the month and year of manufacture and the name or symbol of the  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The symbol applicable to an IBC designed for stacking or not  designed for stacking, as appropriate, must be   marked on all IBCs manufactured, repaired or remanufactured after  January 1, 2011 as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR04JA10.097</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Display the symbol in a durable and visible manner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The symbol must be a square with each side being not less than  100 mm (3.9 inches) by 100 mm (3.9 inches) as measured from the corner  printer marks shown on the figures in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this  section.

A marking in conformance with the  requirements of this paragraph in effect on December 31, 2014, may  continue to be applied to all IBCs manufactured, repaired or  remanufactured between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For domestic transportation, an IBC marked prior to January 1,  2017 and in conformance with the requirements of this paragraph in  effect on December 31, 2014, may continue in service until the end of  its useful life.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For IBCs designed for stacking, the maximum permitted stacking  load applicable when the IBC is in use must be displayed with the  symbol. The mass in kilograms (kg) marked above the symbol must not  exceed the load imposed during the design test, as indicated by the  marking in paragraph (a)(1)(vii) of this section, divided by 1.8. The  letters and numbers indicating the mass must be at least 12 mm (0.48  inches).
