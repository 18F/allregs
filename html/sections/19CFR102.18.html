                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When General Rule of Interpretation (GRI) 2(a) is referred to in Sec. 102.20 as an exception to an allowed change in tariff classification, this means that such change will not be acceptable for purposes of that section if the change results from the assembly of parts into an incomplete or unfinished good which is classifiable in the same manner as a complete or finished good pursuant to GRI 2(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> (1) For purposes of identifying the material that imparts the essential character to a good under Sec. 102.11, the only materials that shall be taken into consideration are those domestic or foreign materials that are classified in a tariff provision from which a change in tariff classification is not allowed under the Sec. 102.20 specific rule or other requirements applicable to the good. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of identifying the material that imparts the essential character to a good under Sec. 102.11, the only materials that shall be taken into consideration are those domestic or foreign materials that are classified in a tariff provision from which a change in tariff classification is not allowed under the Sec. 102.20 specific rule or other requirements applicable to the good. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The materials to be considered must be classified in a tariff provision from which a change in tariff classification is not allowed under the specific rule or other requirements applicable to the good under consideration. For example, in the case of a good classified in HTSUS subheading 8607.11 (the rule for which specifies a change to subheading 8607.11 from any other subheading, except from subheading 8607.12, and except from subheading 8607.19 when that change is pursuant to GRI 2(a)), the only materials that may be considered for purposes of identifying the materials that impart the essential character to the good are those that are classified in subheadings 8607.11, 8607.12 and, if the tariff shift is pursuant to GRI 2(a), 8607.19;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Materials that may be considered include materials produced by the producer of the good and incorporated in the good. For example, if a producer of a good purchases raw materials and converts those raw materials into a component that is incorporated in the good, that component is a material that may be considered for purposes of identifying the materials that impart the essential character to the good, provided that the component is classified in a tariff provision from which a change in tariff classification is not allowed under the specific rule or other requirements applicable to the good; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If there is only one material that is classified in a tariff provision from which a change in tariff classification is not allowed under the Sec. 102.20 specific rule or other requirements applicable to the good, then that material will represent the single material that imparts the essential character to the good under Sec. 102.11.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of determining which one of two or more materials described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section imparts the essential character to a good under Sec. 102.11, various factors may be examined depending upon the type of good involved. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The nature of each material, such as its bulk, quantity, weight or value; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The role of each material in relation to the use of the good.
