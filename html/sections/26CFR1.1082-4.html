                            <p class="depth0">If, in connection with an exchange of stock or securities for stock or securities as described in section 1081(a), or an exchange of property for property as described in section 1081(b), or an exchange as described in section 1081(e), property is acquired by a corporation by the issuance of its stock or securities, the basis of such property shall be determined under section 1082(b). If the corporation issued its stock or securities as part or sole consideration for the property acquired, the basis of the property in the hands of the acquiring corporation is the basis (adjusted to the date of the exchange) which the property would have had in the hands of the transferor if the transfer had not been made, increased in the amount of gain or decreased in the amount of loss recognized under section 1081 to the transferor upon the transfer. If any property is acquired by a corporation from a shareholder as paid-in surplus, or from any person as a contribution to capital, the basis of the property to the corporation is the basis (adjusted to the date of acquisition) of the property in the hands of the transferor.</p>
