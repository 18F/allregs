                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The minimum standards of character shall mean a benchmark of moral, ethical, and emotional strengths established by character traits and past conduct to ensure that the individual is competent to complete his/her job without harm to Indian children. In order to protect Indian children, the IHS has established minimum standards of character requiring completion of a satisfactory background investigation that ensures that no individuals who have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to, any felonious offense or any of two or more misdemeanor offenses under Federal, State, or Tribal law involving crimes of violence; sexual assault, molestation, exploitation, contact, or prostitution; crimes against persons; or offenses committed against children, are placed in positions involving regular contact with or control over Indian children.</p>
