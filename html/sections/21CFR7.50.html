                            <p class="depth0">The Food and Drug Administration will promptly make available to the  public in the weekly FDA Enforcement Report a descriptive listing of  each new recall according to its classification, whether it was Food and  Drug Administration-requested or firm-initiated, and the specific action  being taken by the recalling firm. The Food and Drug Administration will  intentionally delay public notification of recalls of certain drugs and  devices where the agency determines that public notification may cause  unnecessary and harmful anxiety in patients and that initial  consultation between patients and their physicians is essential. The  report will not include a firm's product removals or corrections which  the agency determines to be market withdrawals or stock recoveries. The  report, which also includes other Food and Drug Administration  regulatory actions, e.g., seizures that were effected and injunctions  and prosecutions that were filed, is available upon request from the  Office of Public Affairs (HFI-1), Food and Drug Administration, 5600  Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.</p>
