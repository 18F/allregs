The additive may contain residues of isopropyl alcohol not in excess of 18 percent by weight when used as a processing solvent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ammonolysis of natural tallow fatty acids to form amines that are then reacted with 2-ethylhexanal, reduced, methylated, and subsequently reacted with methyl chloride to form the quaternary ammonium compound known as dimethyl(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogenated tallow ammonium chloride and consisting primarily of dimethyl (2-ethyl hexyl) octa decyl ammonium chloride and dimethyl (2-ethyl hexyl) hexa decyl ammonium chloride.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The food additive described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section contains not more than a total of 2 percent by weight of free amine and amine hydrochloride. The food additive described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section contains not more than 3 percent by weight, each, of free amine and amine hydrochloride as determined by A.O.C.S. method Te 3a-64, ``Acid Value and Free Amine Value of Fatty Quaternary Ammonium Chlorides,'' 2d printing including additions and revisions 1990, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

Excess nonadsorbed additive shall be rinsed away with potable water prior to passage of sugar liquor through the column.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The residue of the additive in the decolorized sugar liquor prior to crystallization shall not exceed 1 part per million of sugar as determined by a method entitled ``Colorimetric Determination of Residual Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (Arquad HTL8) in Sugar and Sugar Solutions,'' June 13, 1990, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1
