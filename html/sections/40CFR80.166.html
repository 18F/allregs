For demonstration of carburetor deposit control performance, any generally accepted vehicle, engine, or bench test procedure and associated performance standard for carburetor deposit control will be considered adequate. Port and throttle body fuel injector deposit control test data will also be considered to be adequate demonstration of an additive's ability to control carburetor deposits. Examples of acceptable test procedures for demonstration of carburetor deposit control, in addition to the fuel injector test procedure listed in Sec. 80.165(a), are contained in the following references:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Test Method for Evaluating Port Fuel Injector (PFI) Deposits in Vehicle Engines'', March 1, 1991, Section 2257, Title 13, California Code of Regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``A Vehicle Test Technique for Studying Port Fuel Injector Deposits--A Coordinating Research Council Program'', Robert Tupa et al., SAE Technical paper No. 890213, 1989.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``The Effects of Fuel Composition and Additives on Multiport Fuel Injector Deposits'', Jack Benson et al., SAE Technical Paper Series No. 861533, 1986.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ``Injector Deposits--The Tip of Intake System Deposit Problems'', Brian Taneguchi, et al., SAE Technical Paper Series No. 861534, 1986.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> ``Fuel Injector, Intake Valve, and Carburetor Detergency Performance of Gasoline Additives'', C.H.

A test fuel conforming to these compositional guidelines may be sampled directly from finished gasolines or may be blended to specification using typical refinery blend stocks. Test data using leaded fuels is preferred for this purpose, but data collected using unleaded fuels may also be acceptable provided that some correlation with additive performance in leaded fuels is available.
