In addition to the above finding, the certification of completion must contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of both the rationale and the process used to arrive at the above finding for the completion of all coal-related reclamation under section 403(a)(1) through (3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A brief summary and resolution of all relevant public comments concerning coal-related impacts, problems, and reclamation projects received by the State or Indian tribe prior to preparation of the certification of completion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A State or Indian tribe agreement to acknowledge and give top priority to any coal-related problem(s) that may be found or occur after submission of the certification of completion and during the life of the approved abandoned mine reclamation program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After review and verification of the information contained in the certification of completion, the Director shall provide notice in the Federal Register and opportunity for public comment. After receipt and evaluation of all public comments and a determination by the Director that the certification is correct, the Director shall concur with the certification and provide final notice of such concurrence in the Federal Register.
