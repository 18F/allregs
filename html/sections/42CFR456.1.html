                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part prescribes requirements concerning control of the  utilization of Medicaid services including--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statewide program of control of the utilization of all  Medicaid services; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific requirements for the control of the utilization of  Medicaid services in institutions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specific requirements for an outpatient drug use review program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The requirements in this part are based on the following  sections of the Act. Table 1 shows the relationship between these  sections of the Act and the requirements in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Methods and procedures to safeguard against unnecessary  utilization of care and services. Section 1902(a)(30) requires that the  State plan provide methods and procedures to safeguard against  unnecessary utilization of care and services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Penalty for failure to have an effective program to control  utilization of institutional services. Section 1903(g)(1) provides for a  reduction in the amount of Federal Medicaid funds paid to a State for  long-stay inpatient services if the State does not make a showing  satisfactory to the Secretary that it has an effective program of  control over utilization of those services. This penalty provision  applies to inpatient services in hospitals, mental hospitals, and  intermediate care facilities (ICF's). Specific requirements are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Under section 1903(g)(1)(A), a physician must certify at  admission, and a physician (or physician assistant or nurse practitioner  under the supervision of a physician) must periodically recertify, the  individual's need for inpatient care.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Under section 1903(g)(1)(B), services must be furnished under a  plan established and periodically evaluated by a physician.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Under section 1903(g)(1)(C), the State must have in effect a  continuous program of review of utilization of care and services under  section 1902(a)(30) whereby each admission is reviewed or screened in  accordance with criteria established by medical and other professional  personnel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Under section 1903(g)(1)(D), the State must have an effective  program under sections 1902(a) (26) and (31) of review of care in  intermediate care facilities and mental hospitals. This must include  evaluation at least annually of the professional management of each  case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Medical review in mental hospitals. Section 1902(a)(26)(A)  requires that the plan provide for a program of medical review that  includes a medical evaluation of each individual's need for care in a  mental hospital, a plan of care, and, where applicable, a plan of  rehabilitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Independent professional review in intermediate care facilities.  Section 1902(a)(31)(A) requires that the plan provide for a program of  independent professional review that includes a medical evaluation of  each individual's need for intermediate care and a written plan of  service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Inspection of care and services in institutions. Sections  1902(a)(26) (B) and (C) and 1902(a)(31) (B) and (C) require that the  plan provide for periodic inspections and reports, by a team of  professional persons, of the care being provided to each beneficiary in  institutions for mental diseases (IMD's), and ICF's participating in  Medicaid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Denial of FFP for failure to have specified utilization review  procedures.   Section 1903(i)(4) provides that FFP is not available in a State's  expenditures for hospital or mental hospital services unless the  institution has in effect a utilization review plan that meets Medicare  requirements. However, the Secretary may waive this requirement if the  Medicaid agency demonstrates to his satisfaction that it has utilization  review procedures superior in effectiveness to the Medicare procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> State health agency guidance on quality and appropriateness of  care and services. Section 1902(a)(33)(A) requires that the plan provide  that the State health or other appropriate medical agency establish a  plan for review, by professional health personnel, of the  appropriateness and quality of Medicaid services to provide guidance to  the Medicaid agency and the State licensing agency in administering the  Medicaid program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Drug use review program. Section 1927(g) of the Act provides  that, for payment to be made under section 1903 of the Act for covered  outpatient drugs, the State must have in operation, by not later than  January 1, 1993, a drug use review (DUR) program. It also requires that  each State provide, either directly or through a contract with a private  organization, for the establishment of a DUR Board.</p><p class="depth3">Table 1</p><p class="depth3">[This table relates the regulations in this part to the sections of the</p><p class="depth3">Act on which they are based.] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">------------------------------------------------------------------------ Subpart A--General........................  1902(a)(30)</p><p class="depth3">1902(a)(33)(A) Subpart B--Utilization Control: All         1902(a)(30)</p><p class="depth3">Medicaid Services.
