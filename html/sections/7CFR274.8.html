The State agency shall  ensure that EBT systems comply with POS technical standards established  by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or International  Organization for Standardization (ISO) where applicable. This includes  the draft EBT ISO 8583 Processor Interface Technical Specifications  contained in the ANSI standards, which delineates a standard message  format for retailers and third parties. In addition, the State agency  shall ensure that the EBT system meets performance and technical  standards in the areas of system processing speeds, system availability  and reliability, system security, system ease-of-use, minimum card and  terminal requirements, performance bonding, and a minimum transaction  set. With prior written approval from FNS, the State agency may utilize  the prevailing industry performance standards in its region in lieu of  those identified in this section. The standards shall be included in all  requests for proposals and contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> System processing speeds. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For leased line systems, 98  percent of EBT transactions shall be processed within 10 seconds or less  and all EBT transactions shall be processed within 15 seconds. Leased  line systems rent telecommunications carriers specifically to connect to  the central authorizing computer. For dial-up systems, 95 percent of the  EBT transactions shall be processed within 15 seconds or less and all  EBT transactions shall be processed within 20 seconds or less. Dial-up  systems utilize existing telecommunications lines to dial up and connect  to the central computer at the time of the transaction. Processing  response time shall be measured at the POS terminal from the time the  `enter' or `send' key is pressed to the receipt and display of  authorization or disapproval information. Third party processors, as  defined in paragraph (h)(5) of this section, shall be required by the  State agency to comply with the same processing response times required  of the primary processor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The EBT system shall provide re-ports, as determined by the  State agency, that document transaction processing response time and the  number and type of problematic transactions that could not be processed  within the standard response time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> System availability and reliability. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The EBT system central  computer shall be available 99.9 percent of scheduled up-time, 24 hours  a day, 7 days per week. Scheduled up-time shall mean the time the  database is available for transactions excluding scheduled downtime for  routine maintenance. The total system, including the system's central  computer, any network or intermediate processing facilities and  cardholder authorization processors, shall be available 98 percent of  scheduled up-time, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Scheduled downtime  for routine maintenance shall occur during non-peak transaction periods.  State certification procedures shall determine whether intermediate  processing facilities and cardholder authorization processors are  capable of complying with system availability standards prescribed  herein prior to permitting the interface with the central computer  system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The system central computer shall permit no more than 2  inaccurate EBT transactions for every 10,000 EBT   transactions processed. The transactions to be included in measuring  system accuracy shall include all types of SNAP transactions permitted  at POS terminals and processed through the host computer, manual  transactions entered into the system, credits to household accounts, and  funds transfers to retailer accounts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reconciliation reports and other information regarding  problematic transactions shall be made available to the State agency by  the system operator, individual retailers, households or financial  institutions as appropriate. Reports on problematic transactions,  including inaccurate transactions shall be delineated by the source of  the problem such as card failure, POS terminal failure, interruption of  telecommunications, or other component failure. Errors shall be resolved  in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> System security. As an addition to or component of the Security  Program required of Automated Data Processing systems prescribed under  Sec. 277.18(m) of this chapter, the State agency shall ensure that the  following EBT security requirements are established:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Storage and control measures to control blank unissued EBT cards  and PINs, and unused or spare POS devices;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Measures to ensure communication access control. Communication  controls shall include the transmission of transaction data and issuance  information from POS terminals to work-stations and terminals at the  data processing center. The following specific security measures shall  be included, as appropriate, in the system design documentation,  operating procedures or the State agency Security Program:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Computer hardware controls that ensure acceptance of data from  authorized terminals only. These controls shall include the use of  mechanisms such as retailer identification codes, terminal identifiers  and user identification codes, and/or other mechanisms and procedures  recognized by the industry;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Software controls, placed at either the terminal or central  computer or both, that establish separate control files containing lists  of authorized retailers, terminal identifying codes, and user access and  identification codes. EBT system software controls shall include  separate checks against the control files in order to validate each  transaction prior to authorization and limiting the number of  unsuccessful PIN attempts that can be made utilizing standard industry  practices before the card is deactivated;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Communications network security that utilizes the Data  Encryption Standard algorithm to encrypt the PIN, at a minimum, from the  point of entry. Other security may include authentication codes and  check-sum digits, in combination with data encoded on the magnetic  stripe such as the PIN and/or PIN offset, to ensure data security during  electronic transmission. Any of the network security measures may be  utilized together or separately and may be applied at the terminal or  central computer as indicated in the approved system design to ensure  communications control;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Manual procedures that provide for secure access to the system  with minimal risk to household or retailer accounts. Manual procedures  may include the utilization of manager identification codes in obtaining  telephonic authorization from the central computer system; requirements  for separate entry with audio response unit verification and  authorization number; and/or the utilization of 24 hour hotline  telephone numbers to authorize transactions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Message validation shall include but shall not be limited to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Message format checks for completeness of the message, correct  order of data, existence of control characters, number and size of data  fields and appropriate format standards as specified in the approved  system design;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Range checks for acceptable date fields, number and valid  account numbers, purchase and refund upper limitations in order to  prevent and control damage to the system accounts;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Reversal of messages that are not fully processed and recorded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Administrative and operational procedures shall ensure that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Functions affecting an account balance are separated or dually  controlled during processing and when requesting Federal reimbursement  through a concentrator bank under the provisions of paragraph (i) of  this section. These functions may include but are not limited to the set  up of accounts, transmittal of funds to and from accounts, access to  files to change account records, and transmittal of retailer deposits to  the ACH network or other means approved by FNS for crediting retailer  bank accounts;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Passwords, identity codes or other security procedures must be  utilized by State agency or local personnel and at data processing  centers;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Software programming changes shall be dual controlled to the  extent possible;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> System operations functions shall be segregated from  reconciliation duties;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A separate EBT security component shall be incorporated into the  State agency Security Program for Automated Data Processing (ADP)  systems where appropriate as prescribed under Sec. 277.18(m) of this  chapter. The periodic risk analyses required by the Security Program  shall address the following items specific to an EBT system:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> EBT system vulnerability to theft and unauthorized use;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Completeness and timeliness of the reconciliation system;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Vulnerability to tampering with or creating household accounts;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Erroneous posting of issuances to household accounts;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Manipulation of retailers' accounts such as creation of false  transactions or intrusion by unauthorized computer users;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Capability to monitor systematic abuses at POS terminals such as  debits for a complete allotment, excessive manual issuances, and  multiple manual transactions at the same time. Such monitoring may be  accomplished through the use of exception reporting;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Tampering with information on the ACH tape or similar  information utilized in a crediting method approved by FNS; and,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> The availability of a complete audit trail. A complete audit  trail shall, at a minimum, be able to provide a complete transaction  history of each individual system activity that affects an account  balance. The audit trail shall include the tracking of issuances from  the Master File and Issuance File, network transactions from POS  terminals to EBT central computer database and system file updates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The State agency shall incorporate the contingency plan  approved by FNS into the Security Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> System ease-of-use. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For all system users, the State agency  shall ensure that the system:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Minimizes the number of separate steps required to complete a  transaction;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Minimizes the number of codes or commands needed to make use of  the system;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Makes available clear and comprehensive account balance  information with a minimum number of actions necessary;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Provides training and instructions for all system users  especially those persons with disabilities;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Makes available prompts on POS terminals or balance only  terminals, where appropriate;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Identifies procedures for problem resolution;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Provides reasonable accommodation for the needs of households  with disabilities in keeping with the Americans with Disabilities Act of  1990.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In addition to the requirements of paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this  section, the State agency shall ensure that retailers utilizing the EBT  system:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Have available manual backup procedures;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Can obtain timely information on daily credits to their banks;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Have available deposit information in a format readily  comparable to information maintained in the store; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Have available instructions on resolving problems with equipment  and retailer accounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Minimum card requirements. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The address of the office where a  card can be returned if found or no longer in use should be printed on  the card.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> FNS reserves the right to require State agencies to place a  Department   logo on the EBT card and/or sleeves or jackets.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> EBT cards and/or sleeves or jackets shall not contain the name  of any State or local official. EBT informational materials shall not  indicate association with any political party or other political  affiliation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> State agencies may require the use of a photograph of one or  more household members on the card. If the State agency does require the  EBT cards to contain a photo, it must establish procedures to ensure  that all appropriate household members or authorized representatives are  able to access benefits from the account as necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> POS terminals. POS terminals shall meet the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Balance information shall not be displayed on the screen of the  POS terminal except for balance-only inquiry terminals;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> PINs shall not be displayed at the terminal; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> PIN encryption shall occur from the point of entry in a manner  which prevents the unsecured transmission between any point in the  system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Transaction receipts. Households shall be provided printed  receipts at the time of transaction. At a minimum this information  shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State the date, merchant's name and location, transaction type,  transaction amount and remaining balance for the SNAP account;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Comply with the requirements of 12 CFR part 205 (Regulation E)  in addition to the requirements of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Identify the SNAP households member's account number (the PAN)  using a truncated number or coded transaction number. The households'  name shall not appear on the receipt except when a signature is required  when utilizing a manual transaction voucher.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Performance bonding. The State agency may require a performance  bond in accordance with Sec. 277.8 of this chapter or utilize other  contractual clauses it deems necessary to enforce the requirements of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Minimum transaction set. At a minimum, the State agency shall  ensure that the EBT system, including third party processors and  retailers driving their own terminals, is capable of providing for  authorizing or rejecting purchases, refunds or customer credits, voids  or cancellations, key entered transactions, balance inquiries and  settlement or close-out transactions. The system must be capable of  completing this transaction set across State borders nationwide in  accordance with standards specified in paragraph (h)(10) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Interoperability. State agencies must adopt uniform standards  to facilitate interoperability and portability nationwide. The term  ``interoperability'' means the EBT system must enable benefits issued in  the form of an EBT card to be redeemed in any State. The term  ``portability'' means the EBT system must enable benefits issued in the  form of an EBT card to be used in any State by a household to purchase  food at a retail food store or a wholesale food concern approved under  the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008. The standards must include the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> EBT system connectivity. State agencies are responsible for  establishing telecommunications links, transaction switching facilities  and any other arrangements with other State agencies necessary for the  routing of interoperable transactions to such other State EBT  authorization systems. State agencies are also responsible for  facilitating the settlement of such interoperable transactions and the  handling of adjustments. These connections need not be direct  connections between State authorization systems but may be facilitated  through agreements and linkages with other designated agents or third  party processors. All State agencies must agree to the timing and  disposition of disputes, error resolution, and adjustments in accordance  with Department regulations at Sec. 273.13(a) and Sec. 273.15(k) of this  chapter and paragraph (f) of this section. State agencies or their  designated agents must draw funds from State SNAP accounts for SNAP  benefits transacted by that State's SNAP recipients, regardless of where  benefits were transacted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Message format. Each authorization system must use the ISO 8583  message format, modified for EBT, in a   version mutually agreed to between the authorization agent and the party  connected for all transactions. Each authorization system must process  each financial transaction as a single message financial transaction,  except for pre-authorized transactions and reversals, processed as  paired transactions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Card Primary Account Number (PAN) Requirements. Track 2 on  each card shall contain the PAN. Each Government entity must obtain an  Issuer Identification Number (IIN) from the American Banker's  Association (ABA). The IIN should be included as the first six digits of  the PAN. The PAN must comply with ISO 7812, Identification Cards-- Numbering System and Registration Procedures for Issuer Identifiers.  Each State agency must be responsible for generating, updating, and  distributing IIN files of all States to each retailer, processor, or  acquirer that is directly connected to the State's authorization system.  Each terminal operator that uses a routing table for routing acquired  transactions must, within 7 calendar days of receiving an IIN routing  table update, modify its routing tables to reflect the updated routing  information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Third Party Processor requirements. Each Third Party Processor  or terminal operator must have primary responsibility and liability for  operating the telecommunications and processing system (including  software and hardware) through which transactions initiated at POS  terminals it owns, operates, controls or for which it has signed an  agreement to accept EBT transactions, are processed and routed, directly  or indirectly, to the appropriate State authorization system. Each  terminal operator must maintain the necessary computer hardware and  software to interface either directly with a State authorization system  or with a third party service provider to obtain access to one or more  State authorization systems. Each terminal operator must also establish  a direct or indirect telecommunications connection for the routing of  transactions to the State authorization system or to a processor  directly or indirectly connected to the State authorization system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> REDE File. The State agency must ensure that their EBT system  verifies FNS retailer numbers for all interstate transactions against  the National REDE file of all FNS EBT retailers to validate these  transactions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Concentrator bank responsibilities. The concentrator bank shall  be a Federally-insured financial institution or other entity acceptable  to the Federal Reserve which has the capability to take retailer credits  and/or debits, obtained from the EBT system operator, and transmit them  to the ACH network operated by the Federal Reserve or through another  process for crediting retailers approved by FNS. Transmittal shall be by  tape or on-line in a format suitable for the ACH or as approved by FNS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The minimum functions of the concentrator bank are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Preparing a daily ACH tape or other crediting process approved  by FNS with information on benefits redeemed and creditable to each  retailer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Transferring the ACH tape or other crediting process approved  by FNS to the Federal Reserve or other entity approved by FNS;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Initiating and accepting reimbursement from the appropriate  U.S. Treasury account through the ASAP system or other payment process  approved by FNS. At the option of FNS, the State agency may designate  another entity as the initiator of reimbursement for SNAP redemptions  provided the entity is acceptable to FNS and U.S. Treasury;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Cooperating in the reconciliation of discrepancies and error  resolution when necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With the approval of FNS, another procedure, other than the ACH  system, may be utilized to credit retailer accounts and/or debit FNS'  account, if it meets the needs of FNS and the EBT system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Re-presentation. The State agency shall ensure that a manual  purchase system is available for use during times when the EBT system is  inaccessible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under certain circumstances, when a manual transaction occurs  due to the inaccessibility of the host computer and the transaction is  rejected because insufficient funds are available in a household's  account, the State agency may permit the re-presentation of the  transaction during subsequent months. At the State agency's option, re- presentation may be permitted within the EBT system as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Re-presentation of manual vouchers when there are insufficient  funds in the EBT account to cover the manual transaction may be  permitted only under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The manual transaction occurred because the host computer was  down and authorization was obtained by the retailer for the transaction;  or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The manual transaction occurred because telephone lines were  down.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Re-presentation of manual vouchers shall not be permitted when  the EBT card, magnetic stripe, PIN pad, card reader, or POS terminal  fails and telephone lines are operational. Manual transactions shall not  be utilized to extend credit to a household via re-presentation when the  household's account balance is insufficient to cover the planned  purchase.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The State agency may debit the benefit allotment of a  household following the insufficient funds transaction in either of two  ways:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any amount which equals at least $10 or up to 10 percent of the  transaction. This amount will be deducted monthly until the total  balance owed is paid-in-full. State agencies may opt to re-present at a  level that is less than the 10 percent maximum, however, this lesser  amount must be applied to all households.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> $50 in the first month and the greater of $10 or 10 percent of  the allotment in subsequent months until the total balance owed is paid- in-full. If the monthly allotment is less than $50, the State shall  debit the account for $10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State agency shall establish procedures for determining the  validity of each re-presentation and subsequent procedures authorizing a  debit from a household's monthly benefit allotment. The State agency may  ask households to voluntarily pay the amount of a represented  transaction or arrange for a faster schedule of payment than identified  in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State agency shall ensure that retailers provide notice to  households at the time of the manual transaction that re-presentation  may occur if there are insufficient benefits in the account to cover the  transaction. The statement shall be printed on the paper voucher or on a  separate sheet of paper. The State agency shall also provide notice to  the household prior to the month when a benefit allotment is reduced  when a re-presentation is necessary. Notice shall be provided to the  household for each insufficient transaction that is to be re-presented  in a future month. The notice shall be provided prior to the month it  occurs and shall state the amount of the reduction in the benefit  allotment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Department shall not accept liability under any  circumstances for the overissuance of benefits due to the utilization of  manual vouchers, including those situations when the host computer is  inaccessible or telecommunications lines are not functioning. However,  the State agency, in consultation with authorized retailers and with the  mutual agreement of the State agency's vendor, if any, may accept  liability for manual purchases within a specified dollar limit. Costs  associated with liabilities accepted by the State agency shall not be  reimbursable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The State agency shall be strictly liable for manual  transactions that result in excess deductions from a household's  account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Store-and-forward. As an alternative to manual transactions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State agencies may opt to allow retailers, at the retailer's own  choice and liability, to perform store-and-forward transactions when the  EBT system cannot be accessed for any reason.   The retailer may forward the transaction to the host one time within 24  hours of when the system again becomes available. Should the 24-hour  window cross into the beginning of a new benefit issuance period,  retailers may draw against all available benefits in the account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State agencies may also opt, in instances where there are  insufficient funds to authorize an otherwise approvable store-and- forward transaction, to allow the retailer to collect the balance  remaining in the client's account, in accordance with the requirements  detailed in this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State Agencies may elect to allow store-and-forward to provide  remaining balances to retailers as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The EBT processor may provide partial approval of the store-and- forward transaction, crediting the retailer with the balance remaining  in the account through a one-step process;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The transaction should be in accordance with the standard  message format requirements for store and forward; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Re-presentation, as described in paragraph (d) of this section,  to obtain the uncollected balance from current or future months'  benefits shall not be allowed for store-and-forward transactions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In States that elect not to give retailers the option described  in this paragraph, all store-and-forward transactions with insufficient  funds will be denied in full.
