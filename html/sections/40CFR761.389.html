                            <p class="depth0">There are no restrictions on the variable testing parameters  described in this section which may be used in the validation study. The  conditions demonstrated in the validation study for these variables  shall become the required conditions for decontamination using the  solvent being validated and shall replace the comparable conditions in  Sec. 761.79(b)(3) through (b)(6). There are limited potential options  for varying a single requirement in this section. If you change one of  these variable requirements, change it only in the way listed in this  section and do not change any other validated conditions. If you desire  to change more than one of the requirements in this section, you must  conduct a new study   to validate the decontamination under the desired conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> through (c) of this section. Do not use a larger surface-area-to- solvent-volumes ratio or different kind of solvent based on the results  of the validation study.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except for the minimum soak time of 1 hour (as required in Sec.  761.386(c)), the length of soak time is not otherwise restricted in the  validation study. The soak time used in the validation study, however,  is a use requirement for subsequent decontamination using the solvent  being validated. It is permissible to use longer soak times for  decontamination than the soak time used in the validation study, if all  other parameters required in Sec. 761.386, and paragraphs (a) and (c)  of this section are used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of this section are used.</p>
