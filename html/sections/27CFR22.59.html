The effective date of the qualifying documents filed by a fiduciary shall coincide with the effective date of the court order or the date specified therein for the fiduciary to assume control. If the fiduciary was not appointed by the court, the date the fiduciary assumed control shall coincide with the effective date of the filing of the qualifying documents.
