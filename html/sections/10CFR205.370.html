                            <p class="depth0">Sections 202(c) and 202(d) of the Federal Power Act are applicable  to any ``entity'' which owns or operates electric power generation,  transmission or distribution facilities. An ``entity'' is a private or  public corporation (utility), a governmental agency, a municipality, a  cooperative or a lawful association of the foregoing. Under this  section, the DOE has the authority to order the temporary connection of  facilities, or the generation or delivery of electricity, which it deems  necessary to alleviate an emergency. Such orders shall be effective for  the time specified and will be subject to the terms and conditions the  DOE specifies. The DOE retains the right to cancel, modify or otherwise  change any order, with or without notice, hearing, or report. Requests  for action under these regulations will be accepted from any ``entity,''  State Public Utility Commission, State Energy Agency, or State Governor.  Actions under these regulations also may be initiated by the DOE on its  own motion. Orders under this authority may be made effective without  prior notice.</p>
