Before assignment to construct or direct the  construction of safety- or security-related SSCs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For-cause. In response to an individual's observed behavior or  physical condition indicating possible substance abuse or after  receiving credible information that an individual is engaging in  substance abuse, as defined in Sec. 26.5;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Post-accident. As soon as practical after an event involving a  human error that was committed by an individual specified in Sec.  26.4(f), where the human error may have caused or contributed to the  accident. The licensee or other entity shall test the individual(s) who  committed the error(s), and need not test individuals who were affected  by the event but whose actions likely did not cause or contribute to the  event.

Urine specimens  collected for drug testing must be subject to validity testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The specimen collection and drug and alcohol testing procedures  of FFD programs under this subpart must protect the donor's privacy and  the integrity of the specimen, and implement stringent quality controls  to ensure that test results are valid and attributable to the correct  individual. At the licensee's or other entity's discretion, specimen  collections and alcohol testing may be conducted at a local hospital or  other facility under the specimen collection and alcohol testing  requirements of 49 CFR Part 40 and subsequent amendments thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Testing of urine specimens for drugs and validity, except  validity screening and initial drug and validity tests that may be  performed by licensee testing facilities, must be performed in a  laboratory that is certified by HHS for that purpose, consistent with  its standards and procedures for certification. Any initial drug test  performed by a licensee or other entity subject to this subpart must use  an immunoassay that meets the requirements of the Food and Drug  Administration for commercial distribution. Urine specimens that yield  positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid initial validity or drug  test results must be subject to confirmatory testing by the HHS- certified laboratory, except for invalid specimens that cannot be  tested. Other specimens that yield positive initial drug test results  must be subject to confirmatory testing by a laboratory that meets  stringent quality control requirements that are comparable to those  required for certification by the HHS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Licensees and other entities shall provide for an MRO review of  positive, adulterated, substituted, and invalid confirmatory drug and  validity test results to determine whether the donor has violated the  FFD policy, before reporting the results to the individual designated by  the licensee or other entity to perform the suitability and fitness  evaluations required under Sec. 26.419.
