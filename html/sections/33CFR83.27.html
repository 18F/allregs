The highest and lowest of these lights shall be red and the middle  light shall be white;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> A rigid replica of the International Code flag ``A'' not less  than 1 meter in height.

One of these lights or shapes shall be exhibited  near the foremast head and one at each end of the fore yard. These  lights or shapes indicate that it is dangerous for another vessel to  approach within 1000 meters of the mine clearance vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A vessel of less than 12 meters in length, except when engaged  in diving operations, is not required to exhibit the lights or shapes  prescribed in this Rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The signals prescribed in this Rule are not signals of vessels  in distress and requiring assistance.
