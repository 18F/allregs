or generation of electricity, ONRR will allow free of royalty or direct use fees geothermal resources that are:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Unavoidably lost or reinjected before use on or off the lease, as determined by BLM;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Reasonably necessary for the lessee to generate plant parasitic electricity or electricity for Federal lease operations, as approved by BLM; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Otherwise used for Federal lease operations related to commercial production or generation of electricity, as approved by BLM.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For Class II and Class III leases where the lessee uses the geothermal resources for a direct use or in a direct use facility, as defined in Sec. 1206.351, resources that are used to generate electricity for Federal lease operations or that are otherwise used for Federal lease operations are subject to direct use fees, except for geothermal resources that are unavoidably lost or reinjected before use on or off the lease, as determined by BLM.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Royalties on byproducts are due at the time the recovered byproduct is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. Byproducts produced and added to stockpiles or inventory do not require payment of royalty until the byproducts are sold, utilized, or otherwise finally disposed of. The ONRR may ask BLM to increase the lease bond to protect the lessor's interest when BLM determines that stockpiles or inventories become excessive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If BLM determines that geothermal resources (including byproducts) were avoidably lost or wasted from the lease, or that geothermal resources (including byproducts) were drained from the lease for which compensatory royalty (or compensatory fees in lieu of compensatory royalty) are due, the value of those geothermal resources, or the royalty or fees owed, will be determined under 30 CFR part 1206, subpart H.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a lessee receives insurance or other compensation for unavoidably lost geothermal resources (including byproducts), royalties at the rates specified in the lease (or fees in lieu of royalties) are due on the amount of, or as a result of, that compensation. This paragraph will not apply to compensation through self-insurance.
