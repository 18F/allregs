[Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In order to allow the Administrator to determine whether or not production motor vehicles (or production motor vehicle engines) conform to the conditions upon which a certificate of conformity has been issued, or conform in all material respects to the design specifications which applied to those vehicles (or engines) described in the application for certification for which a certificate of conformity has been issued to standards prescribed under section 202 of the Act, any manufacturer shall admit any EPA Enforcement Officer or any EPA authorized

EPA will not attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed that local law forbids. However, if local law makes it impossible to do what is necessary to insure the accuracy of data generated at a facility, no informed judgment that a vehicle or engine is certifiable or is covered by a certificate can properly be based on those data. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to locate its testing and manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions where this situation will not arise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For purposes of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Presentation of credentials shall mean display of the document designating a person as an EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA authorized representative.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where vehicle, component, or engine storage areas or facilities are concerned, operating hours shall mean all times during which personnel other than custodial personnel are at work in the vicinity of the area or facility and have access to it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where facilities or areas other than those covered by paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section are concerned, operating hours shall mean all times during which an assembly line is in operation or all times during which testing, maintenance, mileage (or service) accumulation, production or compilation of records, or any other procedure or activity related to certification testing, to translation of designs from the test stage to the production stage, or to vehicle (or engine) manufacture or assembly is being carried out in a facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to, clerical, copying, interpretation and translation services, the making available on request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their working hours to inform the EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA authorized representative of how the facility operates and to answer his questions, and the performance on request of emissions tests on any vehicle (or engine) which is being, has been, or will be used for certification testing. Such tests shall be nondestructive, but may require appropriate mileage (or service) accumulation. A manufacturer may be compelled to cause the personal appearance of any employee at such a facility before an EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA authorized representative by written request for his appearance, signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, served on the manufacturer. Any such employee who has been instructed by the manufacturer to appear will be entitled to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any entry without 24 hour prior written or oral notification to the affected manufacturer shall be authorized in writing by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> EPA may void ab initio a certificate of conformity for vehicle or engine families introduced into commerce if the manufacturer (or contractor for the manufacturer, if applicable) fails to comply with any provision of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives are authorized to seek a warrant or court order authorizing the EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section, as appropriate, to execute the functions specified in this section. EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives may proceed ex parte to obtain a warrant whether or not the Enforcement Officers first attempted to seek permission of the manufacturer or the party in charge of the facilities in question to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A manufacturer shall permit EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives who present a warrant or court order as described in paragraph (e) of this section to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section and as described in the warrant or court order. The manufacturer shall cause those in charge of its facility or facility operated for its benefit to permit EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section pursuant to a warrant or court order whether or not the manufacturer controls the facility. In the absence of such a warrant or court order, EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives may conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section only upon the consent of the manufacturer or the party in charge of the facilities in question.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> It is not a violation of this part or the Clean Air Act for any person to refuse to permit EPA Enforcement Officers or EPA authorized representatives to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this section without a warrant or court order.
