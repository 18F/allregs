Such a computer printout or screen capture shall constitute conclusive evidence that the reporting committee has consulted such Web sites and not found the name of the person sought, but shall not be the exclusive means by which the reporting committee may provide evidence that it has consulted such Web sites and not found the name of the person sought.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A reporting committee shall be subject to the reporting requirement under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if it had actual knowledge that, at the time a contribution was forwarded or received, the person whose name is sought was required to be listed on any registration or report described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Lobbyist/Registrant PAC reporting requirements.
