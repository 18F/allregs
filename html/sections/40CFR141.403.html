                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ground water systems with significant deficiencies or source  water fecal contamination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The treatment technique requirements of  this section must be met by ground water systems when a significant  deficiency is identified or when a ground water source sample collected  under Sec.  141.402(a)(3) is fecal indicator-positive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, Sec.   141.402(a)(4), or Sec.  141.402(b) that is fecal indicator-positive must  comply with the treatment technique requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a significant deficiency is identified at a Subpart H  public water system that uses both ground water and surface water or  ground water under the direct influence of surface water, the system  must comply with provisions of this paragraph except in cases where the  State determines that the significant deficiency is in a portion of the  distribution system that is served solely by surface water or ground  water under the direct influence of surface water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>, or Sec.   141.402(b) requires corrective action. For the purposes of this subpart,  significant deficiencies include, but are not limited to, defects in  design, operation, or maintenance, or a failure or malfunction of the  sources, treatment, storage, or distribution system that the State  determines to be causing, or have potential for causing, the  introduction of contamination into the water delivered to consumers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Within 120 days (or earlier if directed by the State) of  receiving written notification from the State of a significant  deficiency, written notice from a laboratory that a ground water source  sample collected under Sec.  141.402(a)(3) was found to be fecal  indicator-positive, or direction from the State that a fecal indicator- positive sample collected under Sec.  141.402(a)(2), Sec.   141.402(a)(4), or Sec.  141.402(b) requires corrective action, the  ground water system must either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have completed corrective action in accordance with applicable  State plan review processes or other State guidance or direction, if  any, including State-specified interim measures; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any subsequent modifications to a State-approved corrective  action plan and schedule must also be approved by the State.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the State specifies interim measures for protection of the  public health pending State approval of the corrective action plan and  schedule or pending completion of the corrective action plan, the system  must comply with these interim measures as well as with any schedule  specified by the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Corrective action alternatives. Ground water systems that meet  the conditions of paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section must  implement one or more of the following corrective action alternatives:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Correct all significant deficiencies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide an alternate source of water;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Eliminate the source of contamination; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provide treatment that reliably achieves at least 4-log  treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved  combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the  first customer for the ground water source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Special notice to the public of significant deficiencies or  source water fecal contamination. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In addition to the applicable  public notification requirements of Sec.  141.202, a community ground  water system that receives notice from   the State of a significant deficiency or notification of a fecal  indicator-positive ground water source sample that is not invalidated by  the State under Sec.  141.402(d) must inform the public served by the  water system under Sec.  141.153(h)(6) of the fecal indicator-positive  source sample or of any significant deficiency that has not been  corrected. The system must continue to inform the public annually until  the significant deficiency is corrected or the fecal contamination in  the ground water source is determined by the State to be corrected under  paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In addition to the applicable public notification requirements  of Sec.  141.202, a non-community ground water system that receives  notice from the State of a significant deficiency must inform the public  served by the water system in a manner approved by the State of any  significant deficiency that has not been corrected within 12 months of  being notified by the State, or earlier if directed by the State. The  system must continue to inform the public annually until the significant  deficiency is corrected. The information must include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The nature of the significant deficiency and the date the  significant deficiency was identified by the State;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The State-approved plan and schedule for correction of the  significant deficiency, including interim measures, progress to date,  and any interim measures completed; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For systems with a large proportion of non-English speaking  consumers, as determined by the State, information in the appropriate  language(s) regarding the importance of the notice or a telephone number  or address where consumers may contact the system to obtain a translated  copy of the notice or assistance in the appropriate language.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If directed by the State, a non-community water system with  significant deficiencies that have been corrected must inform its  customers of the significant deficiencies, how the deficiencies were  corrected, and the dates of correction under paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance monitoring--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Existing ground water sources. A  ground water system that is not required to meet the source water  monitoring requirements of this subpart for any ground water source  because it provides at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using  inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus  inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer for any ground  water source before December 1, 2009, must notify the State in writing  that it provides at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using  inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus  inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer for the  specified ground water source and begin compliance monitoring in  accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section by December 1, 2009.  Notification to the State must include engineering, operational, or  other information that the State requests to evaluate the submission. If  the system subsequently discontinues 4-log treatment of viruses (using  inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus  inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer for a ground  water source, the system must conduct ground water source monitoring as  required under Sec.  141.402.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The system must notify the State in writing that it provides at  least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a  State-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal)  before or at the first customer for the ground water source.  Notification to the State must include engineering, operational, or  other information that the State requests to evaluate the submission.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The system must conduct compliance monitoring as required under  Sec.  141.403(b)(3) of this subpart within 30 days of placing the source  in service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The system must conduct ground water source monitoring under  Sec.  141.402 if the system subsequently discontinues 4-log treatment of  viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of  4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer  for the ground water source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monitoring requirements. A ground water system subject to the  requirements of paragraphs (a), (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section must  monitor the effectiveness and reliability of treatment for that ground  water source before or at the first customer as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Chemical disinfection--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Ground water systems serving greater  than 3,300 people. A ground water system that serves greater than 3,300  people must continuously monitor the residual disinfectant concentration  using analytical methods specified in Sec.  141.74(a)(2) at a location  approved by the State and must record the lowest residual disinfectant  concentration each day that water from the ground water source is served  to the public. The ground water system must maintain the State- determined residual disinfectant concentration every day the ground  water system serves water from the ground water source to the public. If  there is a failure in the continuous monitoring equipment, the ground  water system must conduct grab sampling every four hours until the  continuous monitoring equipment is returned to service. The system must  resume continuous residual disinfectant monitoring within 14 days.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Ground water systems serving 3,300 or fewer people. A ground  water system that serves 3,300 or fewer people must monitor the residual  disinfectant concentration using analytical methods specified in Sec.   141.74(a)(2) at a location approved by the State and record the residual  disinfection concentration each day that water from the ground water  source is served to the public. The ground water system must maintain  the State-determined residual disinfectant concentration every day the  ground water system serves water from the ground water source to the  public. The ground water system must take a daily grab sample during the  hour of peak flow or at another time specified by the State. If any  daily grab sample measurement falls below the State-determined residual  disinfectant concentration, the ground water system must take follow-up  samples every four hours until the residual disinfectant concentration  is restored to the State-determined level. Alternatively, a ground water  system that serves 3,300 or fewer people may monitor continuously and  meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Membrane filtration. A ground water system that uses membrane  filtration to meet the requirements of this subpart must monitor the  membrane filtration process in accordance with all State-specified  monitoring requirements and must operate the membrane filtration in  accordance with all State-specified compliance requirements. A ground  water system that uses membrane filtration is in compliance with the  requirement to achieve at least 4-log removal of viruses when:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The membrane has an absolute molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), or  an alternate parameter that describes the exclusion characteristics of  the membrane, that can reliably achieve at least 4-log removal of  viruses;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The membrane process is operated in accordance with State- specified compliance requirements; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The integrity of the membrane is intact.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Alternative treatment. A ground water system that uses a  State-approved alternative treatment to meet the requirements of this  subpart by providing at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using  inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus  inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Monitor the alternative treatment in accordance with all State- specified monitoring requirements; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Operate the alternative treatment in accordance with all  compliance requirements that the State determines to be necessary to  achieve at least 4-log treatment of viruses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Discontinuing treatment. A ground water system may discontinue  4-log   treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved  combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the  first customer for a ground water source if the State determines and  documents in writing that 4-log treatment of viruses is no longer  necessary for that ground water source. A system that discontinues 4-log  treatment of viruses is subject to the source water monitoring and  analytical methods requirements of Sec.  141.402 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure to meet the monitoring requirements of paragraph (b) of  this section is a monitoring violation and requires the ground water  system to provide public notification under Sec.  141.204.</p>
