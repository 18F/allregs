                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>  both the fact that payment is to be made and the amount of the payment  are determined at the sole discretion of the employer at or near the end  of the period and not pursuant to any prior contract, agreement, or  promise causing the employee to expect such payments regularly * * *''.  Such sums may not, however, be credited toward overtime compensation due  under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Discretionary character of excluded bonus. In order for a bonus  to qualify for exclusion as a discretionary bonus under section  7(e)(3)(a) the employer must retain discretion both as to the fact of  payment and as to the amount until a time quite close to the end of the  period for which the bonus is paid. The sum, if any, to be paid as a  bonus is determined by the employer without prior promise or agreement.  The employee has no contract right, express or implied, to any amount.  If the employer promises in advance to pay a bonus, he has abandoned his  discretion with regard to it. Thus, if an employer announces to his  employees in January that he intends to pay them a bonus in June, he has  thereby abandoned his discretion regarding the fact of payment by  promising a bonus to his employees. Such a bonus would not be excluded  from the regular rate under section 7(e)(3)(a). Similarly, an employer  who promises to sales employees that they will receive a monthly bonus  computed on the basis of allocating 1 cent for each item sold whenever,  is his discretion, the financial condition of the firm warrants such  payments, has abandoned discretion with regard to the amount of the  bonus though not with regard to the fact of payment. Such a bonus would  not be excluded from the regular rate. On the other hand, if a bonus  such as the one just described were paid without prior contract, promise  or announcement and the decision as to the fact and amount   of payment lay in the employer's sole discretion, the bonus would be  properly excluded from the regular rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Promised bonuses not excluded. The bonus, to be excluded under  section 7(e)(3)(a), must not be paid ``pursuant to any prior contract,  agreement, or promise.'' For example, any bonus which is promised to  employees upon hiring or which is the result of collective bargaining  would not be excluded from the regular rate under this provision of the  Act. Bonuses which are announced to employees to induce them to work  more steadily or more rapidly or more efficiently or to remain with the  firm are regarded as part of the regular rate of pay. Attendance  bonuses, individual or group production bonuses, bonuses for quality and  accuracy of work, bonuses contingent upon the employee's continuing in  employment until the time the payment is to be made and the like are in  this category. They must be included in the regular rate of pay.</p>
