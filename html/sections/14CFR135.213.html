                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever a person operating an aircraft under this part is  required to use a weather report or forecast, that person shall use that  of the U.S. National Weather Service, a source approved by the U.S.  National Weather Service, or a source approved by the Administrator.  However, for operations under VFR, the pilot in command may, if such a  report is not available, use weather information based on that pilot's  own observations or on those of other persons competent to supply  appropriate observations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, weather  observations made and furnished to pilots to conduct IFR operations at  an airport must be taken at the airport where those IFR operations are  conducted, unless the Administrator issues operations specifications  allowing the use of weather observations taken at a location not at the  airport where the IFR operations are conducted. The Administrator issues  such operations specifications when, after investigation by the U.S.  National Weather Service and the certificate-holding district office, it  is found that the standards of safety for that operation would allow the  deviation from this paragraph for a particular operation for which an  air carrier operating certificate or operating certificate has been  issued.
