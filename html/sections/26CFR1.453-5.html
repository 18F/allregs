                                Sec. 1.453-5  Sale of real property treated on installment method.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of Sec. 1.61-6.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Defaults and repossessions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Effective date. This paragraph  shall apply only with respect to taxable years beginning before  September 3, 1964, in respect of which an election has not been properly  made to have the provisions of section 1038 apply. For rules applicable  to taxable years beginning after September 2, 1964, and for taxable  years beginning after December 31, 1957, to which such an election  applies, see section 1038, and Secs. 1.1038-1 through 1.1038-3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Gain or loss on reacquisition of property. If the purchaser of  real property on the installment plan defaults in any of his payments,  and the vendor returning income on the installment method reacquires the  property sold, whether title thereto had been retained by the vendor or  transferred to the purchaser, gain or loss for the year in which the  reacquisition occurs is to be computed upon any installment obligations  of the purchaser which are satisfied or discharged upon the  reacquisition or are applied by the vendor to the purchase or bid price  of the property. Such gain or loss is to be measured by the difference  between the fair market value at the date of reacquisition of the  property reacquired (including the fair market value of any fixed  improvements placed on the property by the purchaser) and the basis in  the hands of the vendor of the obligations of the purchaser which are so  satisfied, discharged, or applied, with proper adjustment for any other  amounts realized or costs incurred in connection with the reacquisition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fair market value of reacquired property. If the property  reacquired is bid in by the vendor at a foreclosure sale, the fair  market value of the property shall be presumed to be the purchase or bid  price thereof in the absence of clear and convincing proof to the  contrary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Basis of obligations. The basis in the hands of the vendor of  the obligations of the purchaser satisfied, discharged, or applied upon  the reacquisition of the property will be the excess of the face value  of such obligations over an amount equal to the income which would be  returnable were the obligations paid in full. For definition of the  basis of an installment obligation, see section 453(d)(2) and paragraph  (b)(2) of Sec. 1.453-9.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Bad debt deduction. No deduction for a bad debt shall in any  case be taken on account of any portion of the obligations of the  purchaser which are treated by the vendor as not having been satisfied,  discharged, or applied upon the reacquisition of the property, unless it  is clearly shown that after the property was reacquired the purchaser  remained liable for such portion; and in no event shall the amount of  the deduction exceed the basis in the hands of the vendor of the portion  of the obligations with respect to which the purchaser remained liable  after the reacquisition. See section 166 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Basis of reacquired property. If the property reacquired is  subsequently sold, the basis for determining gain or loss is the fair  market value of the property at the date of reacquisition, including the  fair market value of any fixed improvements placed on the property by  the purchaser.
