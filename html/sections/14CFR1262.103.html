The Agency's failure to designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filling of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.
