                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As is true generally with respect to provisions of the Act  concerning compensation for overtime hours of work (see Sec. Sec.  778.100 through 778.105 of this chapter, Overnight Transportation Co. v.  Missel, 316 U.S. 572), the unit of time to be used in determining the  application of all provisions of the section 7(b)(3) exemption to an  employee is the workweek. As defined in Sec. 778.105 of this chapter,  an employee's workweek is a fixed and regularly recurring period of 168  hours--seven consecutive 24-hour periods. It may begin at any hour of  any day set by the employer and need not coincide with the calendar  week. Once the workweek has been set it commences each succeeding week  on the same day and at the same hour. Changing the workweek for the  purpose of escaping the requirements of the Act is not permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em>.</p>
