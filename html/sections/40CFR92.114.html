The following is a list of components shown in Figure B114-1 of this section by numeric identifier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Filters. Glass fiber filter paper is permitted for the fine particulate filters (F1, F2, and F3). Optional filter F4 is a coarse filter for large particulates.

Flowmeters FL3, FL4, FL5, and FL6 indicate bypass flow rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Gauges. Downstream gauges are required for any system used for testing under this subpart. Upstream gauges may be required under this subpart. Upstream gauges G1 and G2 measure the input to the CO and CO2 analyzers. Downstream gauges G3 and G4 measure the exit pressure of the CO and CO2 analyzers. If the normal operating range of the downstream gauges is less than 3 inches of water, then the downstream gauges must be capable of reading both pressure and vacuum. Gauges G3 and G4 are not necessary if the analyzers are vented directly to atmospheric pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Pressure gauges.

for sample or span pressure at inlet to flow control valves.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Water traps. Water traps WT1 and WT2 to remove water from the sample. A water trap performing the function of WT1 is required for any system used for testing under this subpart. Chemical dryers are not an acceptable method of removing the water. Water removal by condensation is acceptable. If water is removed by condensation, the sample gas temperature or sample dew point must be monitored either within the water trap or downstream; it may not exceed 45 F (7 C). Means other than condensation may be used only with prior approval from the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Regulators.

The spacing of the radial planes for each hole in the probe must be such that they cover approximately equal cross-sectional areas of the exhaust duct. The angular spacing of the holes must be approximately equal. The angular spacing of any two holes in one plane may not be 180 [20 (see

section view C-C of Figure B114-2 of this section). The holes should be sized such that each has approximately the same flow.

Five holes shall be located in each radial plane along the length of the probe in which sample holes are placed. The spacing of the radial planes for each set of holes in the probe must be such that they cover approximately equal cross-sectional areas of the exhaust duct. For rectangular ducts, this means that the sample hole-planes must be equidistant from each other. For circular ducts, this means that the distance between the sample hole-planes must be decreased with increasing distance from the center of the duct (see Figure B114-4 of this section).</p><p class="depth0">(Note: Particulate concentrations are expected to vary to some extent as a function of the distance to the duct wall; thus each set of sample holes collects a sample that is representative of a cross-sectional disk at that approximate distance from the wall.)

The holes should be sized such that each has approximately the same flow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> The particulate sample probe shall be located in the exhaust duct on an axis which is directly downstream of, and parallel to the axis of the gaseous sample probe.
