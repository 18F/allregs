In that event, the Contracting  Officer shall prepare a request for approval at least 15 business days  prior to the planned date of the contract or order award and forward it  through the HCA and the OPDIV/STAFFDIV CISO for concurrence, to the SPE.  The SPE shall coordinate the processing of the request with the CAO and  the HHS CIO. The request for approval shall briefly describe the  services required, indicate the intended source's pricing and other  terms and conditions, and provide the rationale for award to the  intended source rather   than the GSA BPA holders. The request may include additional supporting  rationale to document the best value decision, as appropriate.</p>
