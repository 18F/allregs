                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determining eligibility for holiday benefits--in general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Most fringe benefit determinations list a specific number of named  holidays for which payment is required. Unless specified otherwise in an  applicable determination,   an employee who performs any work during the workweek in which a named  holiday occurs is entitled to the holiday benefit, regardless of whether  the named holiday falls on a Sunday, another day during the workweek on  which the employee is not normally scheduled to work, or on the  employee's day off. In addition, holiday benefits cannot be denied  because the employee has not been employed by the contractor for a  designated period prior to the named holiday or because the employee did  not work the day before or the day after the holiday, unless such  qualifications are specifically included in the determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An employee who performs no work during the workweek in which a  named holiday occurs is generally not entitled to the holiday benefit.  However, an employee who performs no work during the workweek because he  is on paid vacation or sick leave in accordance with the terms of the  applicable fringe benefit determination is entitled to holiday pay or  another day off with pay to substitute for the named holiday. In  addition, an employee who performs no work during the workweek because  of a layoff does not forfeit his entitlement to holiday benefits if the  layoff is merely a subterfuge by the contractor to avoid the payment of  such benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The obligation to furnish holiday pay for the named holiday may  be discharged if the contractor furnishes another day off with pay in  accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved. However,  in such instances the holidays named in the fringe benefit determination  are the reference points for determining whether an employee is eligible  to receive holiday benefits. In other words, if an employee worked in a  workweek in which a listed holiday occurred, the employee is entitled to  pay for that holiday. Some determinations may provide for a specific  number of holidays without naming them. In such instances the contractor  is free to select the holidays to be taken in accordance with a plan  communicated to the employees involved, and the agreed-upon holidays are  the reference points for determining whether an employee is eligible to  receive holiday benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determining eligibility for holiday benefits--newly hired  employees. The contractor generally is not required to compensate a  newly hired employee for the holiday occurring prior to the hiring of  the employee. However, in the one situation where a named holiday falls  in the first week of a contract, all employees who work during the first  week would be entitled to holiday pay for that day. For example, if a  contract to provide services for the period January 1 through December  31 contained a fringe benefit determination listing New Year's Day as a  named holiday, and if New Year's Day were officially celebrated on  January 2 in the year in question because January 1 fell on a Sunday,  employees hired to begin work on January 3 would be entitled to holiday  pay for New Year's Day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment of holiday benefits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A full-time employee who is  eligible to receive payment for a named holiday must receive a full  day's pay up to 8 hours unless a different standard is used in the  fringe benefit determination, such as one reflecting collectively  bargained holiday benefit requirements issued pursuant to section 4(c)  of the Act or a different historic practice in an industry or locality.  Thus, for example, a contractor must furnish 7 hours of holiday pay to a  full-time employee whose scheduled workday consists of 7 hours. An  employee whose scheduled workday is 10 hours would be entitled to a  holiday payment of 8 hours unless a different standard is used in the  determination. As discussed in Sec. 4.172, such holiday pay must  include the full amount of other fringe benefits to which the employee  is entitled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless a different standard is used in the wage determination, a  full-time employee who works on the day designated as a holiday must be  paid, in addition to the amount he ordinarily would be entitled to for  that day's work, the cash equivalent of a full-day's pay up to 8 hours  or be furnished another day off with pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the fringe benefit determination lists the employee's  birthday as a paid holiday and that day coincides with another listed  holiday, the contractor may discharge his obligation to furnish   payment for the second holiday by either substituting another day off  with pay with the consent of the employee, furnishing holiday benefits  of an extra day's pay, or if the employee works on the holiday in  question, furnish holiday benefits of two extra days' pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an employee's  entitlement to holiday pay fully vests by working in the workweek in  which the named holiday occurs. Accordingly, any employee who is  terminated before receiving the full amount of holiday benefits due him  must be paid the holiday benefits as a final cash payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The rules and regulations for furnishing holiday pay to  temporary and part-time employees are discussed in Sec. 4.176.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The rules and regulations for furnishing equivalent fringe  benefits or cash equivalents in lieu of holiday pay are discussed in  Sec. 4.177.</p>
