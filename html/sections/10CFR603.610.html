For example, a for-profit participant would require a university subrecipient to comply with requirements that apply to a university participant and would require a GOCO or FFRDC subrecipient to comply with standards that conform as much as practicable with the requirements in the GOCO/FFRDC procurement contract. Note that this policy applies to subawards for substantive performance of portions of the RD&D; project supported by the TIA and not to participants' purchases of goods or services needed to carry out the RD&D.;</p><p class="depth0">Financial Matters</p>
