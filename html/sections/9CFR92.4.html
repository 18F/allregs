If a region recognized as free of a specified animal disease in this subchapter experiences an outbreak of that disease, APHIS will take immediate action to prohibit or restrict imports of animals and animal products from that region. The prohibitions or restrictions may be imposed on only a portion of the region previously recognized as free of a disease.

(1) Following removal of disease-free status from all or part of a region, APHIS may reassess the disease situation in that region to determine whether it is necessary to continue the interim prohibitions or restrictions. In reassessing a region's disease status, APHIS will take into consideration the standards of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) for reinstatement of disease-free status, as well as all relevant information obtained through public comments or collected by or submitted to APHIS through other means.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Following removal of disease-free status from all or part of a region, APHIS may reassess the disease situation in that region to determine whether it is necessary to continue the interim prohibitions or restrictions.
