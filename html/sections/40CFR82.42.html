Refrigerant Recovery Procedure</p><p class="depth0">3. 1 Connect the recovery unit service hoses, which shall have shutoff valves within 12 in (30 cm) of the service ends, to the vehicle air-conditioning system service ports.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Operate the recovery equipment as covered by the equipment manufacturers recommended procedure.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1 Start the recovery process and remove the refrigerant from the vehicle AC system. Operate the recovery unit until the vehicle system has been reduced from a pressure to a vacuum. With the recovery unit shut off for at least 5 min, determine that there is no refrigerant remaining in the vehicle AC system. If the vehicle system has pressure, additional recovery operation is required to remove the remaining refrigerant. Repeat the operation until the vehicle AC system vacuum level remains stable for 2 min.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Close the valves in the service lines and then remove the service lines from the vehicle system. Proceed with the repair/service. If the recovery equipment has automatic closing valves, be sure they are properly operating.</p><p class="depth0">4. Service With Manifold Gage Set</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Service hoses must have shutoff valves in the high, low, and center service hoses within 12 in (30 cm) of the service ends. Valves must be closed prior to hose removal from the air-conditioning system. This will reduce the volume of refrigerant contained in the service hose that would otherwise be vented to atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 During all service operations, the valves should be closed until connected to the vehicle air-conditioning system or the charging source to avoid introduction of air and to contain the refrigerant rather than vent open to atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 When the manifold gage set is disconnected from the air-conditioning system or when the center hose is moved to another device which cannot accept refrigerant pressure, the gage set hoses should first be attached to the reclaim equipment to recover the refrigerant from the hoses.

Continuous is defined as completing recovery/recycle and recharge (if applicable) operations with no more than a brief reset period between vehicles, and shall not include time delays for allowing a system to outgas (which shall be part of the recovery period provided by this standard). Continuous may include time out for an air purge if necessary, although it is understood that extended equipment-off time is preferred to allow NCG and refrigerant separation in the supply tank for optimum results.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.1 The equipment shall be capable of removing a minimum of 95.0% of the refrigerant from the test system in 30 minutes or less, without external heating, or use of any device (such as shields, reflectors, special lights, etc.) which could heat components of the system. The recovery procedures shall be based on 21 to 24 C (70 to 75 F) ambient temperature. The test system for qualifying shall be a 1.4 kg (3.0 lbs) capacity orifice tube/accumulator system in a 2005 Chevrolet Suburban with front and rear A/C, or the test option described in 10.5, and shall be determined by accurately weighing the recovery machine with the resolution and accuracy of within 3 g (.006 lb) in the range of the machine's weight. The laboratory shall maintain records of the vehicle, including its VIN (vehicle identification number).</p><p class="depth0">7.1.2 However, the preceding shall not preclude a brief period of engine operation at fast idle (up to 15 minutes, up to 2000 rpm) to circulate refrigerant and oil, and provide

some engine and warm-up of A/C refrigeration components. The laboratory shall monitor coolant temperature per the vehicle engine coolant temperature sensor, and coolant temperature shall not be allowed to exceed 105 C (221 F).

The equipment must include a provision for checking the accuracy, per the requirements of 9.1.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 During recovery operation, the equipment shall provide overfill protection to assure that the liquid fill of the storage container (which may be integral or external) does not exceed 80% of the tank's rated volume at 21 C per Department of Transportation (DOT) Standard, CFR Title 49, Section 173.304 and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Portable refillable tanks or containers used in conjunction with this equipment must be labeled ``HFC-134a (R-134a),'' meet applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) or Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Standards, and shall incorporate fittings per SAE J2197.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 The cylinder valve shall comply with the standard for cylinder valves, UL 1769.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 The pressure relief device shall comply with the Pressure Relief Device Standard Part 1--Cylinders for Compressed Gases, CGA Pamphlet S-1.1.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.3 The tank assembly shall be marked to indicate the first retest date, which shall be 5 years after the date of manufacture. The marking shall indicate that retest must be performed every subsequent 5 years. SAE J2296 provides an inspection procedure. The marking shall be in letters at least 6 mm (\1/4\ in) high.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.4 ASME tanks as defined in UL-1963 may be used and are exempt from the retest requirements.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.5 If the machine is designed for recharging, and the marketer permits use of a non-refillable refrigerant tank, the machine shall include a way to ensure refrigerant remaining in the tank (called the ``heel'') to no more than 2% of tank rated capacity when the tank is indicated to be empty. This may be done by the machine marketer as follows:</p><p class="depth0"> Specify a non-venting procedure, to minimize the amount of unused refrigerant remaining in the tank. The machine shall include any devices required for the procedure, other than ordinary service shop tools and supplies, and include in the operator's manual, any instructions.</p><p class="depth0"> Provide an automatic or (with instructions in the operator's manual) semi-automatic non-venting procedure with the machine.</p><p class="depth0">The laboratory shall test for the 2% capability. For testing purposes it may use a refillable tank, minimum 15 lb capacity (6.8 kg) containing a minimum of 7.5 lbs (3.4 kg) refrigerant. The test is as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Weigh the tank at the start of the test, on a scale accurate to plus/minus 3 grams, to ensure it contains sufficient refrigerant.</p><p class="depth0">b. Operate the machine to remove refrigerant from the tank, charging into a holding container until the tank is indicated to be empty. Continue with the marketer's recommended procedure for the 2% capability.</p><p class="depth0">c. Weigh the tank, on a scale accurate to plus/minus 3 grams.</p><p class="depth0">d. Using the recovery compressor and/or a vacuum pump, draw the tank into a vacuum of 9 to 10 inches Mercury (225 to 250 mm Mercury). The tank must hold that vacuum with a decay of less than 10% in 10 minutes. If vacuum decays 10% or more, the procedure shall be repeated as necessary to ensure the tank is empty.</p><p class="depth0">e. Weigh the tank on a scale accurate to plus/minus 3 grams. The difference in weight from Steps 3 to 5 shall be within 2% of the weight of the amount of refrigerant that is the tanks rated capacity.</p><p class="depth0">f. This test may be performed at the conclusion of testing in 10.4 or 10.5. If the machine passes or has passed all other testing in this standard, the marketer may make modifications in procedure and/or machine operation and retest once at a later date, within 90 days. If the machine fails the retest, the machine must be completely retested per this standard, or may be certified per the following alternative. The marketer of the machine may specify use of a non-refillable refrigerant tank that provides for recycling and/or disposal of the residual refrigerant, in either case in a manner that does not vent. Or the marketer may exclude use of a one-way container, in the machine's operating instructions.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 All flexible hoses must comply with SAE J2196.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 Service hoses must have shutoff devices located at the connection point to the system being serviced. Any hoses or lines connected to refrigerant containers on or in the machine also shall have shutoff devices at the connection points, so that the containers may be changed without loss of refrigerant. A tank that is a permanent installation is exempt from this requirement.</p><p class="depth0">7.6 The equipment shall separate oil from the refrigerant, measure the amount accurate to 20 ml (0.7 oz.), so the technician has an accurate basis for adding oil to the system.</p><p class="depth0">7.6.1 This statement shall be predominately identified in the equipment service manual.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Use only new lubricant to replace the amount removed during the recycling process. Used lubricant should be discarded

per applicable federal, state and local requirements.</p><p class="depth0">8. Testing</p><p class="depth0">This test procedure and its requirements are to be used to determine the ability of the recycling equipment to adequately recycle contaminated refrigerant.</p><p class="depth0">8.1 The equipment shall be able to clean the contaminated refrigerant in Sec. 8.3 to the purity level defined in SAE J2099.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 The equipment shall be operated in accordance with the manufacturer's operating instructions.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 Contaminated HFC-134a (R-134a) Sample</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 The standard contaminated refrigerant shall consist of liquid HFC-134a with 1300 ppm (by weight) moisture (equivalent to saturation at 38 C, 100 F), 45000 ppm (by weight) HFC-134a compatible lubricant, and 1000 ppm (by weight) of noncondensable gases (air).</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.1 The HFC-134a compatible lubricant referred to in 8.3.1, shall be polyalkylene glycol (PAG), ISO 100 such as UCLN or PAG ISO 46-55, such as Idemitsu or equivalent, which shall contain no more than 1000 ppm by weight of moisture.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1.2 Although the test lubricant is a PAG, to conform to that used in the test vehicle system, the equipment manufacturer also shall ensure that it is compatible with polyol ester lubricant, such as ND 11 as used in electrically driven compressors in some hybrid vehicles.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 Test Cycle</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 The equipment must be preconditioned by processing 13.6 kg (30 lb) of the standard contaminated HFC-134a at an ambient of 21 to 24 C (70 to 75 F) before starting the test cycle. 1.13 kg (2.56 lb) samples are to be processed at 5 min intervals.

This shall be determined during SAE J2099 testing.)</p><p class="depth0">9. Recharging the System</p><p class="depth0">9.1 It is the responsibility of the equipment manufacturer to ensure that the vacuum removal performance leaves the system 98% free of NCGs before recharging, following recovery and recycle under the provisions of this document.</p><p class="depth0">The equipment must be capable of both indicating and recharging the system to within 15 g (0.50 oz) of vehicle manufacturer's specifications. The laboratory shall test for this capability by choosing a charge amount that is within the range of the vehicle manufacturer's specifications. The equipment must indicate and charge the system with that chosen amount, within [15 g (0.5 oz).</p><p class="depth0">Example: If 500 g is chosen, the actual and indicated charge must be 485 to 515 g, with any difference between actual and indicated charge within the laboratory scale accuracy requirements of this standard. If a scale is used in the machine, the equipment manufacturer shall provide a method or service for the technician to check scale accuracy, and include any necessary accuracy-checking device (such as a calibration weight(s)) with the machine. If a mass flow system is used for charge determination, it must maintain accuracy equal to the 15 g (0.50 oz) specification. The equipment manufacturer shall provide a method for checking accuracy and include any necessary accuracy testing device(s) with the machine. If the accuracy testing device(s) for a scale or mass flow machine includes a consumable, the manufacturer shall include a quantity of replacement or refill devices for five years of periodic testing as recommended.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 If any other system is used for charge determination, such as a positive displacement pump, the equipment manufacturer shall provide a method and any needed device(s) to check accuracy that is/are appropriate for its method of operation, including any temperature-compensating trim if used.</p><p class="depth0">10. Equipment Test Procedure by Laboratory for Recovery/Recycling and</p><p class="depth0">Recovery/Recycling/Recharging Machines</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Preliminary: Ambient (in shop) temperature shall be 21 to 24 C (70 to 75 F). Test vehicle shall be ``overnight cold'' (not run for at least eight hours).</p><p class="depth0">10.2 The machine must have a self-contained provision for checking accuracy of

the indicated amount of refrigerant recovered in liquid or vapor or mixture form(s) from a vehicle system and (if applicable) charged into a vehicle, and adjusting if necessary, to meet requirements of 9.1, 9.2. Therefore: If the machine uses a scale for that purpose, check the accuracy of that scale and make any adjustment if necessary. If an alternative method of measuring refrigerant is used, follow the equipment manufacturer's procedure for ensuring accuracy. Next, move the machine, such as by rolling it, along the floor, a minimum of 20 feet (6.1 meters) within 10 seconds. Follow with the test procedure in 10.3, then 10.4 or 10.5.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Test Procedure</p><p class="depth0">If desired, this test procedure may be preceded by engine/system operation for up to 15 minutes, up to 2000 rpm.</p><p class="depth0">1. You must start with an empty system, using this method: (a) Operate machine to recover refrigerant, per equipment manufacturer's instructions. (b) Deep-vacuum system to a minimum of 710 mm (28 in) of mercury. (c) Monitor vacuum for decay, checking every 20 minutes. If decay exceeds 75 mm (3 in), deep vacuum the system again. When system holds 710 mm (28 in) 75 mm (3 in) of mercury vacuum for three hours, it is considered empty.</p><p class="depth0">2. Place machine on a platform scale with the capacity to weigh the recovery/recycle/recharge machine, and with the resolution and accuracy of within [3 g (.006 lb) in the range of the machine's weight. Weight should include the machine's service hoses draped over the machine, and with the machine's oil reservoir removed. If necessary to add oil to vehicle system as a result of a system operation preparatory to the recovery process, inject the needed quantity through the service valve at this time.</p><p class="depth0">3. Record weight of machine in as weight A.</p><p class="depth0">4. Reconnect service hoses to the test vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">5. Follow the equipment manufacturer's specified procedure for charging the vehicle manufacturer's recommended amount of refrigerant into the system. Note: if this does not apply to the machine under test, i.e. a recovery/recycling only machine, the use of charging equipment that meets this standard and the platform scale shall be used to verify the accuracy of the charge.</p><p class="depth0">6. Disconnect the service hoses from the test vehicle and drape them on the machine. Check and record the weight of the machine. Record this weight as weight B. The difference between weight A and weight B should be equal to the recommended charge that was installed per the machine's display, within 15 g (0.5 oz). If the difference is greater than 15 g ([3 g), the machine fails the charge accuracy test, and no other tests shall be performed at that time. The manufacturer must document changes made to improve accuracy and furnish them to the laboratory prior to a new test. Exception: If the maximum deviation is no more than a total of 20 g, the calibration of the scale or other measuring system may be rechecked and readjusted once, and the entire test repeated just once.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Recovery Test Using a Vehicle</p><p class="depth0">1. Following a successful system charge, the system and engine shall be run for 15 minutes at 2000 rpm to circulate oil and refrigerant, following which engine and system shall rest for eight hours. Then the laboratory may begin the recovery test. If the machine manufacturer specifies, operate the engine/system for up to 15 minutes, at up to 2000 rpm, then shut off engine/system.</p><p class="depth0">2. If the machine has an automatic air purge, disable it. Check the weight of the machine with the platform scale (service hoses draped over machine, oil reservoir removed). Record the number as Weight C. Reinstall oil reservoir if it had been removed in the recovery procedure.</p><p class="depth0">3. Start timer. Connect service hoses to system of test vehicle and perform recovery per the equipment manufacturer's instructions. The vehicle system service valves' cores must remain in the fittings for this procedure.</p><p class="depth0">4. When recovery is completed, including from service hoses if that is part of the recommended procedure, disconnect hoses and drape over machine. Stop timer. The elapsed time shall be 30.0 minutes or less. If it is in excess of this time, the machine fails the test and no retest is allowed. The manufacturer must document changes made to the machine to improve its performance before a new test is allowed, and furnish them to the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">5. If the recovery is completed in no more than the 30.0 minutes, measure the oil level in the reservoir, remove the reservoir and then determine the amount of refrigerant recovered, as detailed in Nos. 6 and 7: As measured by the machine and also by noting the weight of the platform scale, which shall be recorded as Weight D.</p><p class="depth0">6. The platform scale shall indicate that a minimum of 95% of the amount charged into the system has been recovered. If the platform scale indicates a lower percentage has been recovered, the machine fails the recovery test.</p><p class="depth0">7. The machine display shall indicate that a minimum of 95.0% of the amount charged into the system has been recovered, within a tolerance of [30 g (1 oz) when compared with the platform scale (Weight D minus Weight C). The 30 g (1 oz) tolerance may produce a machine display reading that is below the 95.0% recovery. If a greater difference between machine and platform scale occurs, the machine fails the recovery test.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Recovery Test Fixture Test Option</p><p class="depth0">If an equipment manufacturer chooses, as an alternative to the actual vehicle, it may certify to SAE J2788 with a laboratory fixture that is composed entirely of all the original equipment parts of a single model year for the 3.0 lb capacity front/rear A/C system in the 2005-07 Chevrolet Suburban. All parts must be those OE-specified for one model year system and no parts may be eliminated or bypassed from the chosen system, or reproduced by a non-OE source. No parts may be added and/or relocated from the OE position in the 2005-07 Suburban. No parts may be modified in any way that could affect system performance for testing under this standard, except adding refrigerant line bends and/or loops to make the system more compact. Reducing the total length of the lines, however, is not permitted. The fixture system shall be powered by an electric motor, run at a speed not to exceed 2000 rpm, and for this test option, no system warm-up or equivalent procedure may be used. The certifying laboratory shall maintain records of all parts purchased, including invoices and payments. The assembly of the parts shall, as an outside-the-vehicle package, duplicate the OE system and its routing, including bends, except for permitted additions of bends and/or loops in refrigerant lines. Aside from the absence of engine operation and the limitations posed by the standard and the use of the electric motor, the test shall otherwise be the same as the test on the Suburban, including test temperature.
