                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At least 60 days prior to the beginning of each calendar year, and as may be necessary thereafter, the Board shall prepare and submit to the Department a budget for the calendar year covering its anticipated expenses and disbursements in administering this subpart. Each such budget shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of objectives and strategy for each program, plan, or project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A summary of anticipated revenue, with comparative data or at least one preceding year (except for the initial budget);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A summary of proposed expenditures for each program, plan, or project; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Staff and administrative expense breakdowns, with comparative data for at least one preceding year (except for the initial budget).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each budget shall provide adequate funds to defray its proposed expenditures and to provide for a reserve as set forth in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subject to this section, any amendment or addition to an approved budget must be approved by the Department, including shifting funds from one program, plan, or project to another. Shifts of funds which do not cause an increase in the Board's approved budget and which are consistent with governing bylaws need not have prior approval by the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Board is authorized to incur such expenses, including provision for a reserve, as the Department finds reasonable and likely to be incurred by the Board for its maintenance and functioning, and to enable it to exercise its powers and perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. Such expenses shall be paid from funds received by the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> With approval of the Department, the Board may borrow money for the payment of administrative expenses, subject to the same fiscal, budget, and audit controls as other funds of the Board. Any funds borrowed by the Board shall be expended only for startup costs and capital outlays and are limited to the first year of operation of the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Board may accept voluntary contributions, but these shall only be used to pay expenses incurred in the conduct of programs, plans, and projects. Voluntary contributions shall be free from any encumbrance by the donor, and the Board shall retain complete control of their use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Board shall reimburse the Department for all expenses incurred by the Department in the implementation, administration, and supervision of the Order, including all referendum costs in connection with the Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Board may not expend for administration, maintenance, and functioning of the Board in any calendar year an amount that exceeds 15 percent of the assessments and other income received by the Board for that calendar

year. Reimbursements to the Department required under paragraph (g) of this section, are excluded from this limitation on spending.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Board may establish an operating monetary reserve and may carry over to subsequent fiscal periods excess funds in any reserve so established: Provided that the funds in the reserve do not exceed one fiscal period's budget. Subject to approval by the Department, such reserve funds may be used to defray any expenses authorized under this part.</p>
