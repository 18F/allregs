                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of the section are applicable to the National  System of Interstate and Defense Highways and reasonable access thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The maximum gross vehicle weight shall be 80,000 pounds except  where lower gross vehicle weight is dictated by the bridge formula.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The maximum gross weight upon any one axle, including any one  axle of a group of axles, or a vehicle is 20,000 pounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The maximum gross weight on tandem axles is 34,000 pounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No vehicle or combination of vehicles shall be moved or operated  on any Interstate highway when the gross weight on two or more  consecutive axles exceeds the limitations prescribed by the following  formula, referred to as the Bridge Gross Weight Formula: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14OC91.012   except that two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load  of 34,000 pounds each if the overall distance between the first and last  axle is 36 feet or more. In no case shall the   total gross weight of a vehicle exceed 80,000 pounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Except as provided herein, States may not enforce on the  Interstate System vehicle weight limits of less than 20,000 pounds on a  single axle, 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle, or the weights derived from  the Bridge Formula, up to a maximum of 80,000 pounds, including all  enforcement tolerances. States may not limit tire loads to less than 500  pounds per inch of tire or tread width, except that such limits may not  be applied to tires on the steering axle. States may not limit steering  axle weights to less than 20,000 pounds or the axle rating established  by the manufacturer, whichever is lower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The weights in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section  shall be inclusive of all tolerances, enforcement or otherwise, with the  exception of a scale allowance factor when using portable scales (wheel- load weighers). The current accuracy of such scales is generally within  2 or 3 percent of actual weight, but in no case shall an allowance in  excess of 5 percent be applied. Penalty or fine schedules which impose  no fine up to a specified threshold, i.e., 1,000 pounds, will be  considered as tolerance provisions not authorized by 23 U.S.C. 127.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> States may issue special permits without regard to the axle,  gross, or Federal Bridge Formula requirements for nondivisible vehicles  or loads.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section  shall not apply to single-, or tandem-axle weights, or gross weights  legally authorized under State law on July 1, 1956. The group of axles  requirement established in this section shall not apply to vehicles  legally grandfathered under State groups of axles tables or formulas on  January 4, 1975. Grandfathered weight limits are vested on the date  specified by Congress and remain available to a State even if it chooses  to adopt a lower weight limit for a time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section  shall not apply to the operation on Interstate Route 68 in Allegany and  Garrett Counties, Maryland, of any specialized vehicle equipped with a  steering axle and a tridem axle and used for hauling coal, logs, and  pulpwood if such vehicle is of a type of vehicle as was operating in  such counties on U.S. Routes 40 or 48 for such purposes on August 1,  1991.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Any over-the-road bus, or any vehicle which is regularly and  exclusively used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger bus,  is excluded from the axle weight limits in paragraphs (c) through (e) of  this section until October 1, 2009. Any State that has enforced, in the  period beginning October 6, 1992, and ending November 30, 2005, a single  axle weight limitation of 20,000 pounds or greater but less than 24,000  pounds may not enforce a single axle weight limit on these vehicles of  less than 24,000 lbs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section  shall not apply to the operation, on I-99 between Bedford and Bald  Eagle, Pennsylvania, of any vehicle that could legally operate on this  highway section before December 29, 1995.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Any vehicle subject to this subpart that utilizes an auxiliary  power or idle reduction technology unit in order to promote reduction of  fuel use and emissions because of engine idling, may be allowed up to an  additional 400 lbs. total in gross, axle, tandem, or bridge formula  weight limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To be eligible for this exception, the operator of the vehicle  must be able to prove:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By written certification, the weight of the APU; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By demonstration or certification, that the idle reduction  technology is fully functional at all times.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certification of the weight of the APU must be available to law  enforcement officers if the vehicle is found in violation of applicable  weight laws. The additional weight allowed cannot exceed 400 lbs. or the  weight certified, whichever is less.
