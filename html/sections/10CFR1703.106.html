No determination shall be made that a fee waiver or  reduction request should be denied, until the Designated FOIA Officer  has consulted with the General Counsel's Office. If the determination is  made that the written request for a waiver or reduction of fees does not  meet the requirements of this section, the Designated FOIA Officer shall  inform the requester that the request for waiver or reduction of fees is  being denied and set forth his appeal rights under Sec. 1703.109.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A person requesting the board to waive or reduce search, review,  or duplication fees shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe the purpose for which the requester intends to use the  requested information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Explain the extent to which the requester will extract and  analyze the substantive content of the agency record;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Describe the nature of the specific activity or research in  which the agency records will be used and the specific qualifications  the requester possesses to utilize information for the intended use in  such a way that it will contribute to public understanding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Describe the likely impact of disclosure of the requested  records on the public's understanding of the subject as compared to the  level of understanding of the subject existing prior to disclosure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Describe the size and nature of the public to whose  understanding a contribution will be made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Describe the intended means of dissemination to the general  public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Indicate if public access to information will be provided free  of charge or provided for an access or publication fee; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Describe any commercial or private interest the requester or any   other party has in the agency records sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Board shall waive or reduce fees, without further specific  information from the requester if, from information provided with the  request for agency records made under Sec. 1703.105, it can determine  that disclosure of the information in the agency records is in the  public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to  public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government  and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In making a determination regarding a request for a waiver or  reduction of fees, the Board shall consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the subject of the requested agency records concerns the  operations or activities of the Government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether disclosure of the information is likely to contribute  significantly to public understanding of Government operations or  activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether, and the extent to which, the requester has a commercial  interest that would be furthered by the disclosure of the requested  agency records; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of  the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public  interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial  interest of the requester.</p>
