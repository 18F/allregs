                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>. A  qualified hedging transaction is an integrated economic transaction, as  provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, consisting of a qualifying  debt instrument as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and a  Sec. 1.988-5(a) hedge as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. If  a taxpayer enters into a transaction that is a qualified hedging  transaction, no exchange gain or loss is recognized by the taxpayer on  the qualifying debt instrument or on the Sec. 1.988-5(a) hedge for the  period that either is part of a qualified hedging transaction, and the  transactions shall be integrated as provided in paragraph (a)(9) of this  section. However, if the qualified hedging transaction results in a  synthetic nonfunctional currency denominated debt instrument, such  instrument shall be subject to the rules of Sec. 1.988-2(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception. This paragraph (a) does not apply with respect to a  qualified hedging transaction that creates a synthetic asset or  liability denominated in, or determined by reference to, a currency  other than the U.S. dollar if the rate that approximates the Federal  short-term rate in such currency is at least 20 percentage points higher  than the Federal short term rate (determined under section 1274(d)) on  the date the taxpayer identifies the transaction as a qualified hedging  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Qualifying debt instrument--(i) In general. A qualifying debt  instrument is a debt instrument described in Sec. 1.988-1(a)(2)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>,  regardless of whether denominated in, or determined by reference to,  nonfunctional currency (including dual currency debt instruments, multi- currency debt instruments and contingent payment debt instruments). A  qualifying debt instrument does not include accounts payable, accounts  receivable or similar items of expense or income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for debt instrument of which all payments are  proportionately hedged. If a debt instrument satisfies   the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, and all  principal and interest payments under the instrument are hedged in the  same proportion, then for purposes of this paragraph (a), that portion  of the instrument that is hedged is eligible to be treated as a  qualifying debt instrument, and the rules of this paragraph (a) shall  apply separately to such qualifying debt instrument. See Example 8 in  paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Section 1.988-5(a) hedge--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A Sec. 1.988-5(a)  hedge (hereinafter referred to in this paragraph (a) as a ``hedge'') is  a spot contract, futures contract, forward contract, option contract,  notional principal contract, currency swap contract, similar financial  instrument, or series or combination thereof, that when integrated with  a qualifying debt instrument permits the calculation of a yield to  maturity (under principles of section 1272) in the currency in which the  synthetic debt instrument is denominated (as determined under paragraph  (a)(9)(ii)(A) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> in lieu of the definition of swap  agreement in section 2(e)(5) of Notice 87-11, 1987-1 C.B. 423 to  transactions entered into after December 31, 1986 and before September  21, 1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Definition of integrated economic transaction. A qualifying debt  instrument and a hedge are an integrated economic transaction if all of  the following requirements are satisfied--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All payments to be made or received under the qualifying debt  instrument (or amounts determined by reference to a nonfunctional  currency) are fully hedged on the date the taxpayer identifies the  transaction under paragraph (a) of this section as a qualified hedging  transaction such that a yield to maturity (under principles of section  1272) in the currency in which the synthetic debt instrument is  denominated (as determined under paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(A) of this  section) can be calculated. Any contingent payment features of the  qualifying debt instrument must be fully offset by the hedge such that  the synthetic debt instrument is not classified as a contingent payment  debt instrument. See Examples 6 and 7 of paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The hedge is identified in accordance with paragraph (a)(8) of  this section on or before the date the acquisition of the financial  instrument (or instruments) constituting the hedge is settled or closed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> None of the parties to the hedge are related. The term  ``related'' means the relationships defined in section 267(b) or section  707(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a qualified business unit with a residence, as  defined in section 988(a)(3)(B), outside of the United States, both the  qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are properly reflected on the  books of such qualified business unit throughout the term of the  qualified hedging transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Subject to the limitations of paragraph (a)(5) of this section,  both the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are entered into by  the same individual, partnership, trust, estate, or corporation. With  respect to a corporation, the same corporation must enter into both the  qualifying debt instrument and the hedge whether or not such corporation  is a member of an affiliated group of corporations that files a  consolidated return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> With respect to a foreign person engaged in a U.S. trade or  business that enters into a qualifying debt instrument or hedge through  such trade or business, all items of income and expense associated with  the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge (other than interest  expense that is subject to Sec. 1.882-5), would have been effectively  connected with such U.S. trade or business throughout the term of the  qualified hedging transaction had this paragraph (a) not applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special rules for legging in and legging out of integrated  treatment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Legging in. ``Legging in'' to integrated treatment under  this paragraph (a) means that a hedge is entered into after the date the  qualifying debt instrument is entered into or acquired, and the  requirements of this paragraph (a) are satisfied on the date the hedge  is entered into (``leg in date''). If a taxpayer legs into integrated  treatment, the following rules shall apply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Exchange gain or loss shall be realized with respect to the  qualifying debt instrument determined solely by reference to changes in  exchange rates between--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date the instrument was acquired by the holder, or the date  the obligor assumed the obligation to make payments under the  instrument; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The leg in date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The recognition of such gain or loss will be deferred until the  date the qualifying debt instrument matures or is otherwise disposed of.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The source and character of such gain or loss shall be  determined on the leg in date as if the qualifying debt instrument was  actually sold or otherwise terminated by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Transactions part of a straddle. At the discretion of the  Commissioner, a transaction shall not satisfy the requirements of  paragraph (a)(5) of this section if the debt instrument making up the  qualified hedging transaction is part of a straddle as defined in  section 1092(c) prior to the time the qualified hedging transaction is  identified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Identification requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Identification by the taxpayer.  A taxpayer must establish a record and before the close of the date the  hedge is entered into, the taxpayer must enter into the record for each  qualified hedging transaction the following information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date the qualifying debt instrument and hedge were entered  into;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are  identified as constituting a qualified hedging transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The amount that must be deferred, if any, under paragraph (a)(6)  of this section and the source and character of such deferred amount;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A description of the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A summary of the cash flow resulting from treating the  qualifying debt instrument and the hedge as a qualified hedging  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identification by trustee on behalf of beneficiary. A trustee  of a trust that enters into a qualified hedging transaction may satisfy  the identification requirements described in paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this  section on behalf of a beneficiary of such trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Identification by the Commissioner. If--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A taxpayer enters into a qualifying debt instrument and a hedge  but fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this  paragraph (a), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> On the basis of all the facts and circumstances, the  Commissioner concludes that the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge  are, in substance, a qualified hedging transaction,  then the Commissioner may treat the qualifying debt instrument and the  hedge as a qualified hedging transaction. The Commissioner may identify  a qualifying debt instrument and a hedge as a qualified hedging  transaction regardless of whether the qualifying debt instrument and the  hedge are held by the same taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Taxation of qualified hedging transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  General rule. If a transaction constitutes a qualified hedging  transaction, the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are integrated  and treated as a single transaction with respect to the taxpayer that  has entered into the qualified hedging transaction during the period  that the transaction qualifies as a qualified hedging transaction.  Neither the qualifying debt instrument nor the hedge that makes up the  qualified hedging transaction shall be subject to section 263(g), 1092  or 1256 for the period such transactions are integrated. However, the  qualified hedging transaction may be subject to section 263(g) or 1092  if such transaction is part of a straddle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rule for income or expense of foreign persons  effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Interest income of  a foreign person resulting from a qualified hedging transaction entered  into by such foreign person that satisfies the requirements of paragraph  (a)(5)(vii) of this section shall be treated as effectively connected  with a U.S. trade or business. Interest expense of a foreign person  resulting from a qualified hedging transaction entered into by such  foreign person that satisfies the requirements of paragraph   (a)(5)(vii) of this section shall be allocated and apportioned under  Sec. 1.882-5 of the regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Special rule for foreign persons that enter into qualified  hedging transactions giving rise to U.S. source income not effectively  connected with a U.S. trade or business. If a foreign person enters into  a qualified hedging transaction that gives rise to U.S. source interest  income (determined under the source rules for synthetic asset  transactions as provided in this section) not effectively connected with  a U.S. trade or business of such foreign person, for purposes of  sections 871(a), 881, 1441, 1442 and 6049, the provisions of this  paragraph (a) shall not apply and such sections of the Internal Revenue  Code shall be applied separately to the qualifying debt instrument and  the hedge. To the extent relevant to any foreign person, if the  requirements of this paragraph (a) are otherwise met, the provisions of  this paragraph (a) shall apply for all other purposes of the Internal  Revenue Code (e.g., for purposes of calculating the earnings and profits  of a controlled foreign corporation that enters into a qualified hedging  transaction through a qualified business unit resident outside the  United States, income or expense with respect to such qualified hedging  transaction shall be calculated under the provisions of this paragraph  (a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income tax effects of integration. The effect of integrating  and treating a transaction as a single transaction is to create a  synthetic debt instrument for income tax purposes, which is subject to  the original issue discount provisions of sections 1272 through 1288 and  163(e), the terms of which are determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Denomination of synthetic debt instrument. In the case where the  qualifying debt instrument is a borrowing, the denomination of the  synthetic debt instrument is the same as the currency paid under the  terms of the hedge to acquire the currency used to make payments under  the qualifying debt instrument. In the case where the qualifying debt  instrument is a lending, the denomination of the synthetic debt  instrument is the same as the currency received under the terms of the  hedge in exchange for amounts received under the qualifying debt  instrument. For example, if the hedge is a forward contract to acquire  British pounds for dollars, and the qualifying debt instrument is a  borrowing denominated in British pounds, the synthetic debt instrument  is considered a borrowing in dollars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Term and accrual periods. The term of the synthetic debt  instrument shall be the period beginning on the identification date and  ending on the date the qualifying debt instrument matures or such  earlier date that the qualifying debt instrument or hedge is disposed of  or otherwise terminated. Unless otherwise clearly indicated by the  payment interval under the hedge, the accrual period shall be a six  month period which ends on the dates determined under section  1272(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Issue price. The issue price of the synthetic debt instrument is  the adjusted issue price of the qualifying debt instrument translated  into the currency in which the synthetic debt instrument is denominated  at the spot rate on the identification date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Stated redemption price at maturity. In the case where the  qualifying debt instrument is a borrowing, the stated redemption price  at maturity shall be determined under section 1273(a)(2) on the  identification date by reference to the amounts to be paid under the  hedge to acquire the currency necessary to make interest and principal  payments on the qualifying debt instrument. In the case where the  qualifying debt instrument is a lending, the stated redemption price at  maturity shall be determined under section 1273(a)(2) on the  identification date by reference to the amounts to be received under the  hedge in exchange for the interest and principal payments received  pursuant to the terms of the qualifying debt instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Source of interest income and allocation of expense. Interest  income from a synthetic debt instrument described in paragraph  (a)(9)(ii) of this section shall be sourced by reference to the source  of income under sections 861 (a)(1) and 862(a)(1) of the qualifying debt  instrument. The character for purposes of section 904 of interest income  from a synthetic debt instrument shall be determined by reference to the   character of the interest income from qualifying debt instrument.  Interest expense from a synthetic debt instrument described in paragraph  (a)(9)(ii) of this section shall be allocated and apportioned under  Secs. 1.861-8T through 1.861-12T or the successor sections thereof or  under Sec. 1.882-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> K is a U.S. corporation with the U.S. dollar as its  functional currency. On December 24, 1989, K agrees to close the  following transaction on December 31, 1989. K will borrow from an  unrelated party on December 31, 1989, 100 British pounds ()  for 3 years at a 10 percent rate of interest, payable annually, with no  principal payment due until the final installment. K will also enter  into a currency swap contract with an unrelated counterparty under the  terms of which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> K will swap, on December 31, 1989, the 100 obtained  from the borrowing for $100; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> K will exchange dollars for pounds pursuant to the following  table in order to obtain the pounds necessary to make payments on the  pound borrowing:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">U.S.</p><p class="depth0">Date                         dollars       Pounds ------------------------------------------------------------------------ December 31, 1990.............................            8           10 December 31, 1991.............................            8           10 December 31, 1992.............................          108          110 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The interest rate on the borrowing is set and the exchange  rates on the swap are fixed on December 24, 1989. On December 31, 1989,  K borrows the 100 and swaps such pounds for $100. Assume x  has satisfied the identification requirements of paragraph (a)(8) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The pound borrowing (which constitutes a qualifying debt  instrument under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) and the currency swap  contract (which constitutes a hedge under paragraph (a)(4) of this  section) are a qualified hedging transaction as defined in paragraph  (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, the pound borrowing and the swap  are integrated and treated as one transaction with the following  consequences:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The integration of the pound borrowing and the swap results in a  synthetic dollar borrowing with an issue price of $100 under section  1273(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The total amount of interest and principal of the synthetic  dollar borrowing is equal to the dollar payments made by K under the  currency swap contract (i.e., $8 in 1990, $8 in 1991, and $108 in 1992).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The stated redemption price at maturity (defined in section  1273(a)(2)) is $100. Because the stated redemption price equals the  issue price, there is no OID on the synthetic dollar borrowing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> K may deduct the annual interest payments of $8 under section  163(a) (subject to any limitations on deductibility imposed by other  provisions of the Code) according to its regular method of accounting. K  has also paid $100 as a return of principal in 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> K must allocate and apportion its interest expense with respect  to the synthetic dollar borrowing under the rules of Secs. 1.861-8T  through 1.861-12T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> K, a U.S. corporation, has the U.S. dollar as its  functional currency. On December 24, 1989, when the spot rate for Swiss  francs (Sf) is Sf1 = $1, K enters into a forward contract to purchase  Sf100 in exchange for $100.04 for delivery on December 31, 1989. The  Sf100 are to be used for the purchase of a franc denominated debt  instrument on December 31, 1989. The instrument will have a term of 3  years, an issue price of Sf100, and will bear interest at 6 percent,  payable annually, with no repayment of principal until the final  installment. On December 24, 1989, K also enters into a series of  forward contracts to sell the franc interest and principal payments that  will be received under the terms of the franc denominated debt  instrument for dollars according to the following schedule:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">U.S.</p><p class="depth0">Date                         dollars       Francs ------------------------------------------------------------------------ December 31, 1990.............................         6.12            6 December 31, 1991.............................         6.23            6 December 31, 1992.............................       112.16          106 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On December 31, 1989, K takes delivery of the Sf100 and  purchases the franc denominated debt instrument. Assume K satisfies the  identification requirements of paragraph (a)(8) of this section. The  purchase of the franc debt instrument (which constitutes a qualifying  debt instrument under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) and the series  of forward contracts (which constitute a hedge under paragraph (a)(4) of  this section) are a qualified hedging transaction under paragraph (a)(1)  of this section. Accordingly, the franc debt instrument and all the  forward contracts are integrated and treated as one transaction with the  following consequences:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The integration of the franc debt instrument and the forward  contracts results in a synthetic dollar debt instrument in an amount  equal to the dollars exchanged under the forward contract to purchase  the francs necessary to acquire the franc debt instrument. Accordingly,  the issue price is $100.04 (section 1273(b)(2) of the Code).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The total amount of interest and principal received by K with  respect to the synthetic dollar debt instrument is equal to the dollars  received under the forward sales contracts (i.e., $6.12 in 1990, $6.23  in 1991, and $112.16 in 1992).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The synthetic dollar debt instrument is an installment  obligation and its stated redemption price at maturity is $106.15 (i.e.,  $6.12 of the payments in 1990, 1991, and 1992 are treated as periodic  interest payments under the principles of section 1273). Because the  stated redemption price at maturity exceeds the issue price, under  section 1273(a)(1) the synthetic dollar debt instrument has OID of  $6.11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The yield to maturity of the synthetic dollar debt instrument is  8.00 percent, compounded annually. Assuming K is a calendar year  taxpayer, it must include interest income of $8.00 in 1990 (of which  $1.88 constitutes OID), $8.15 in 1991 (of which $2.03 constitutes OID),  and $8.32 in 1992 (of which $2.20 constitutes OID). The amount of the  final payment received by K in excess of the interest income includible  is a return of principal and a payment of previously accrued OID.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The source of the interest income shall be determined by  applying sections 861(a)(1) and 862(a)(1) with reference to the franc  interest income that would have been received had the transaction not  been integrated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> K is an accrual method U.S. corporation with the U.S.  dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1992, K borrows 100  British pounds () for 3 years at a 10% rate of interest  payable on December 31 of each year with no principal payment due until  the final installment. The spot rate on January 1, 1992, is  1 = $1.50. On January 1, 1993, when the spot rate is  1 = $1.60, K enters into a currency swap contract with an  unrelated counterparty under the terms of which K will exchange dollars  for pounds pursuant to the following table in order to obtain the pounds  necessary to make the remaining payments on the pound borrowing:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">U.S.</p><p class="depth0">Date                         dollars       Pounds ------------------------------------------------------------------------ December 31, 1993.............................        12.80           10 December 31, 1994.............................        12.80           10 December 31, 1994.............................       160.00          100 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assume that British pound interest rates are still 10% and that  K properly identifies the pound borrowing and the currency swap contract  as a qualified hedging transaction as provided in paragraph (a)(8) of  this section. Under paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section, K must realize  exchange gain or loss with respect to the pound borrowing determined  solely by reference to changes in exchange rates between January 1, 1992  and January 1, 1993. (Thus, gain or loss from other factors such as  movements in interest rates or changes in credit quality of K are not  taken into account). Recognition of such gain or loss is deferred until  K terminates its pound borrowing. Accordingly, K must defer exchange  loss in the amount of $10 [(100x1.50)- (100x1.60)].</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Additionally, the qualified hedging transaction is treated as  a synthetic U.S. dollar debt instrument with an issue date of January 1,  1993, and a maturity date of December 31, 1994. The issue price of the  synthetic debt instrument is $160 (100x1.60, the spot rate  on January 1, 1993) and the total amount of interest and principal is  $185.60. The accrual period is the one year period beginning on January  1 and ending December 31 of each year. The stated redemption price at  maturity is $160. Thus, K is treated as paying $12.80 of interest in  1993, $12.80 of interest in 1994, and $160 of principal in 1994. The  interest expense from the synthetic instrument is allocated and  apportioned in accordance with the rules of Secs. 1.861-8T through  1.861-12T. Sections 263(g), 1092, and 1256 do not apply to the positions  comprising the synthetic dollar borrowing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> K is an accrual method U.S. corporation with the U.S.  dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1990, K borrows 100  British pounds () for 3 years at a 10% rate of interest  payable on December 31 of each year with no principal payment due until  the final installment. The spot rate on January 1, 1990, is  1 = $1.50.

For purposes  of determining exchange gain or loss on the 100 principal  amount of the debt instrument for the period January 1, 1991, to  December 31, 1992, the spot rate on January 1, 1991 is used rather than  the spot rate on the issue date.

The instrument has a term of 3 years,  an adjusted issue price of Sf200, and will bear interest at 5 percent,  payable annually, with no repayment of principal until the final  installment. The U.S. dollar interest rate on an equivalent instrument  is 8% on January 1, 1990, compounded annually.

On January 1, 1991, K  disposes of the forward contracts that were to mature on December 31,  1991, and December 31, 1992 and incurs a loss of $3.62 (the present  value of $.10 with respect to the 1991 contract and $4.27 with respect  to the 1992 contract).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The purchase of the franc debt instrument (which constitutes a  qualifying debt instrument under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) and  the series of forward contracts (which constitute a hedge under  paragraph (a)(4) of this section) are a qualified hedging transaction  under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

Additionally,   K is deemed to have sold the franc debt instrument for $102.86, its fair  market value in dollars on January 1, 1991. K will compute gain or loss  with respect to the deemed sale of the franc debt instrument by  subtracting its adjusted basis in the instrument ($102.86--the value of  the Sf200 issue price at the spot rate on the identification date plus  $2.86 of original issue discount accrued on the synthetic dollar debt  instrument for 1990) from the amount realized on the deemed sale of  $102.86. Thus K realizes and recognizes no gain or loss from the deemed  sale of the debt instrument. The dollar amount used to determine  exchange gain or loss with respect to the franc debt instrument is the  Sf200 issue price on January 1, 1991, translated into dollars at the  spot rate on January 1, 1991, of Sf1 = U.S.$.5143.

K will pay for the option  by making payments to the writer of the option equal to $5 each December  31 from 1992 through 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The net economic effect of these transactions is that K has  created a liability with a principal amount and amount paid at maturity  of $1,000, with an interest cost of 8.5% (8% on debt instrument, 0.5%  option price) compounded annually. For example, if on December 31, 1996,  the spot exchange rate is $1 = 100 yen, K pays $500 on the bond [$2,000- (150,000 yen/$100)], and $500 in satisfaction of the forward contract  [$1,000-(150,000 yen/$100)]. If instead the spot exchange rate on  December 31, 1996 is $1 = 200 yen, K pays $1,250 on the bond [$2,000- (150,000 yen/$200)] and K receives $250 in satisfaction of the forward  contract [$1,000-(150,000 yen/$200)]. Finally, if the spot exchange rate  on December 31, 1996 is $1 = 50 yen, K pays $0 on the bond [$2,000- (150,000 yen/$50), but the bond holder is not required under the terms  of the instrument to pay additional principal]; K exercises the option  to buy 150,000 yen for $2,000; and K then delivers the 150,000 yen as  required by the forward contract in exchange for $1,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assume K satisfies the identification requirements of paragraph  (a)(8) of this section.

Accordingly,  with respect to K, the debt instrument and the contracts are integrated,  resulting in a synthetic dollar debt instrument with an issue price of  $1000, a stated redemption price at maturity of $1000 and a yield to  maturity of 8.5% compounded annually (with no original issue discount).

R will receive pound payments from the bank  equal to 3.7% on the notional principal amount of 504  (compounded semi-annually) for the period beginning January 1, 1995 and  ending December 31, 1999.

The  combined effect is that the premium paid by the investor partially  offsets the coupon payments resulting in a return of 3.7% (10.85%- 7.15%). Similarly, the dollar payments under the hedging contract to be  made by R are computed by multiplying the dollar notional principal  amount by an 8.00% rate (compounded semi-annually) which the facts  assume would be the rate paid on a conventional currency swap plus a  premium of 0.15% (amortized semi-annually) on the dollar notional  principal amount for an embedded FTSE equity index option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assume R satisfies the identification requirements of paragraph  (a)(8) of this section. The indexed debt instrument described in  paragraph (i) of this Example 7 constitutes a qualifying debt instrument  under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The hedging contract described  in paragraph (ii) of this Example 7 constitutes a hedge under paragraph  (a)(4) of this section. Since both the pound exposure of the indexed  debt instrument and the exposure to movements of the FTSE embedded in  the indexed debt instrument are hedged such that a yield to maturity can  be determined in dollars, the transaction satisfies the requirement of  paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section. Assuming the transactions satisfy  the other requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the indexed  debt instrument and hedge are a qualified hedging transaction under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, with respect to R, the  debt instrument and the contracts are integrated, resulting in a  synthetic dollar debt instrument with an issue price of $1000, a stated  redemption price at maturity of $1000 and a yield to maturity of 8.15%  compounded semi-annually (with no original issue discount).

A hedged executory  contract is an executory contract as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of  this section that is the subject of a hedge as defined in paragraph  (b)(2)(iii) of this section, provided that the following requirements  are satisfied--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The executory contract and the hedge are identified as a hedged  executory contract as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The hedge is entered into (i.e., settled or closed, or in the  case of nonfunctional currency deposited in an account with a bank or  other financial institution, such currency is acquired and deposited) on  or after the date the executory contract is entered into and before the  accrual date as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The executory contract is hedged in whole or in part throughout  the period beginning with the date the hedge is identified in accordance  with paragraph (b)(3) of this section and ending on or after the accrual  date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> None of the parties to the hedge are related. The term related  means the relationships defined in section 267(b) and section 707(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> In the case of a qualified business unit with a residence, as  defined in section 988(a)(3)(B), outside of the United States, both the  executory contract and the hedge are properly reflected on the books of  the same qualified business unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Subject to the limitations of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) of this  section, both the executory contract and the hedge are entered into by  the same individual, partnership, trust, estate, or corporation. With  respect to a corporation, the same corporation must enter into both the  executory contract and the hedge whether or not such corporation is a  member of an affiliated group of corporations that files a consolidated  return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> With respect to a foreign person engaged in a U.S. trade or  business that enters into an executory contract or hedge through such  trade or business, all items of income and expense associated with the  executory contract and the hedge would have been effectively connected  with such U.S. trade or business throughout the term of the hedged  executory contract had this paragraph (b) not applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Executory contract--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as provided in  paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, an executory contract is an  agreement entered into before the accrual date to pay nonfunctional  currency (or an amount determined with reference thereto) in the future  with respect to the purchase of property used in the ordinary course of  the taxpayer's business, or the acquisition of a service (or services),  in the future, or to receive nonfunctional currency (or an amount  determined with reference thereto) in the future with respect to the  sale of property used or held for sale in the ordinary course of the  taxpayer's business, or the performance of a service (or services), in  the future. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a contract to buy or  sell stock shall be considered an executory contract. (Thus, for  example, a contract to sell stock of an affiliate is an executory  contract for this purpose.) On the accrual date, such agreement ceases  to be considered an executory contract and is treated as an account  payable or receivable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exceptions. An executory contract does not include a section 988  transaction. For example, a forward contract to purchase nonfunctional  currency is not an executory contract. An executory contract also does  not include a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Effective date for contracts to buy or sell stock. That part of  paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section which provides that a contract  to buy or sell stock shall be considered an executory contract applies  to contracts to buy or sell stock entered into on or after March 17,  1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Hedge--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the  term hedge means a deposit of nonfunctional currency in a hedging  account (as defined paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(D) of this section), a forward  or futures contract described in Sec. 1.988-1(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii), or  combination thereof, which reduces the risk of exchange rate  fluctuations by reference to the taxpayer's functional currency with  respect to nonfunctional currency payments made or received under an  executory contract. The term hedge also includes an option contract  described in Sec. 1.988-1(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii), but only if the  option's expiration date is on or before the accrual date. The premium  paid for an option that lapses shall be integrated with the executory  contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rule for series of hedges. A series of hedges as defined  in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section shall be considered a hedge  if the executory contract is hedged in whole or in part throughout the  period beginning with the date the hedge is identified in accordance  with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section and ending on or after the  accrual date. A taxpayer that enters into a series of hedges will be  deemed to have satisfied the preceding sentence if the hedge that  succeeds a hedge that has been terminated is entered into no later than  the business day following such termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Special rules for historical rate rollovers--(1) Definition. A  historical rate rollover is an extension of the maturity date of a  forward contract where the new forward rate is adjusted on the rollover  date to reflect the taxpayer's gain or loss on the contract as of the  rollover date plus the time value of such gain or loss through the new  maturity date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certain historical rate rollovers considered a hedge. A  historical rate rollover is considered a hedge if the rollover date is  before the accrual date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Treatment of time value component of certain historical rate  rollovers that are hedges. Interest income or expense determined under  Sec. 1.988-2(d)(2)(v) with respect to a historical rate rollover shall  be considered part of a hedge if the period beginning on the first date  a hedging contract is rolled over and ending on the date payment is made  or received under the executory contract does not exceed 183 days. Such  interest income or expense shall not be recognized and shall be an  adjustment to the income from, or expense of, the services performed or  received under the executory contract, or to the amount realized or  basis of the property sold or purchased under the executory contract.  For the treatment of such interest income or expense that is not  considered part of a hedge, see Sec. 1.988-2(d)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Special rules regarding deposits of nonfunctional currency in a  hedging account. A hedging account is an account with a bank or other  financial institution used exclusively for deposits of nonfunctional  currency used to hedge executory contracts. For purposes of determining  the basis of units in such account that comprise the hedge, only those  units in the account as of the accrual date shall be taken into  consideration. A taxpayer may adopt any reasonable convention  (consistently applied to all hedging accounts) to determine which units  comprise the hedge as of the accrual date and the basis of the units as  of such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Interest income on deposit of nonfunctional currency in a  hedging account. Interest income on a deposit of nonfunctional currency  in a hedging account may be taken into account for purposes of  determining the amount of a hedge if such interest is accrued on or  before the accrual date. However, such interest income shall be included  in income as provided in section 61. For example, if a taxpayer with the  dollar as its functional currency enters into an executory contract for  the purchase   and delivery of a machine in one year for 100 British pounds  (), and on such date deposits 90.91 in a  properly identified bank account that bears interest at the rate of 10%,  the interest that accrues prior to the accrual date shall be included in  income and may be considered a hedge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Accrual date. The accrual date is the date when the item of  income or expense (including a capital expenditure) that relates to an  executory contract is required to be accrued under the taxpayer's method  of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Payment date. The payment date is the date when payment is made  or received with respect to an executory contract or the subsequent  corresponding account payable or receivable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Identification rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Identification by the taxpayer. A  taxpayer must establish a record and before the close of the date the  hedge is entered into, the taxpayer must enter into the record a clear  description of the executory contract and the hedge and indicate that  the transaction is being identified in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identification by the Commissioner. If a taxpayer enters into  an executory contract and a hedge but fails to satisfy one or more of  the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and, based on the  facts and circumstances, the Commissioner concludes that the executory  contract in substance is hedged, then the Commissioner may apply the  provisions of paragraph (b) of this section as if the taxpayer had  satisfied all of the requirements therein, and may make appropriate  adjustments. The Commissioner may apply the provisions of paragraph (b)  of this section regardless of whether the executory contract and the  hedge are held by the same taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effect of hedged executory contract--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a  taxpayer enters into a hedged executory contract, amounts paid or  received under the hedge by the taxpayer are treated as paid or received  by the taxpayer under the executory contract, or any subsequent account  payable or receivable, or that portion to which the hedge relates. Also,  the taxpayer recognizes no exchange gain or loss on the hedge. If an  executory contract, on the accrual date, becomes an account payable or  receivable, the taxpayer recognizes no exchange gain or loss on such  payable or receivable for the period covered by the hedge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partially hedged executory contracts. The effect of integrating  an executory contract and a hedge that partially hedges such contract is  to treat the amounts paid or received under the hedge as paid or  received under the portion of the executory contract being hedged, or  any subsequent account payable or receivable. The income or expense of  services performed or received under the executory contract, or the  amount realized or basis of property sold or purchased under the  executory contract, that is attributable to that portion of the  executory contract that is not hedged shall be translated into  functional currency on the accrual date. Exchange gain or loss shall be  realized when payment is made or received with respect to any payable or  receivable arising on the accrual date with respect to such unhedged  amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Disposition of a hedge or executory contract prior to the  accrual date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If a taxpayer identifies an executory  contract as part of a hedged executory contract as defined in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section, and disposes of (or otherwise terminates) the  executory contract prior to the accrual date, the hedge shall be treated  as sold for its fair market value on the date the executory contract is  disposed of and any gain or loss shall be realized and recognized on  such date. Such gain or loss shall be an adjustment to the amount  received or expended with respect to the disposition or termination, if  any. The spot rate on the date the hedge is treated as sold shall be  used to determine subsequent exchange gain or loss on the hedge. If a  taxpayer identifies a hedge as part of a hedged executory contract as  defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and disposes of the hedge  prior to the accrual date, any gain or loss realized on such disposition  shall not be recognized and shall be an adjustment to the income from,  or expense of, the services performed or received under the executory  contract, or to the amount realized or   basis of the property sold or purchased under the executory contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>  of this section are not satisfied, the hedged executory contract shall  be terminated and the provisions of paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this  section shall apply to any gain or loss previously realized with respect  to such hedge. Any subsequent hedging contracts entered into to reduce  the risk of exchange rate movements with respect to such executory  contract shall not be considered a hedge as defined in paragraph  (b)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Executory contracts between related persons. If an executory  contract is between related persons as defined in sections 267(b) and  707(b), and the taxpayer disposes of the hedge or terminates the  executory contract prior to the accrual date, the Commissioner may  redetermine the timing, source, and character of gain or loss from the  hedge or the executory contract if he determines that a significant  purpose for disposing of the hedge or terminating the executory contract  prior to the accrual date was to affect the timing, source, or character  of income, gain, expense, or loss for Federal income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Sections 263(g), 1092, and 1256 do not apply. Sections 263(g),  1092, and 1256 do not apply with respect to an executory contract or  hedge which comprise a hedged executory contract as defined in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section. However, sections 263(g), 1092 and 1256 may  apply to the hedged executory contract if such transaction is part of a  straddle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The principles set forth in paragraph (b) of this  section are illustrated in the following examples. The examples assume  that K is an accrual method, calendar year U.S. corporation with the  dollar as its functional currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section. On June 1, 1993, K takes delivery of the  500,000 Swiss francs (in exchange for $250,000) under the forward  contract and makes payment of 500,000 Swiss francs to JPF in exchange  for the machine. Assume that the accrual date is June 1, 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the hedge is integrated  with the executory contract. Therefore, K is deemed to have paid  $250,000 for the machine and there is no exchange gain or loss on the  foreign currency forward contract. K's basis in the machine is $250,000.  Section 1256 does not apply to the forward contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1992, K enters into a contract with S,  a Swiss machine manufacturer, to pay 500,000 Swiss francs for delivery  of a machine on June 1, 1993. Under the contract, K is not obligated to  pay for the machine until September 1, 1993. On February 1, 1992, K  enters into a foreign currency forward agreement to purchase 500,000  Swiss francs for $250,000 for delivery on September 1, 1993. K properly  identifies the executory contract and the hedge in accordance with  paragraph (b)(3) of this section. On June 1, 1993, K takes delivery of  machine. Assume that under K's method of accounting the delivery date is  the accrual date. On September 1, 1993, K takes delivery of the 500,000  Swiss francs (in exchange for $250,000) under the forward contract and  makes payment of 500,000 Swiss francs to S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the hedge is integrated  with the executory contract. Therefore K is deemed to have paid $250,000  for the machine and there is no exchange gain or loss on the foreign  currency forward contract. Thus K's basis in the machine is $250,000. In  addition, no exchange gain or loss is recognized on the payable in  existence from June 1, 1993, to September 1, 1993. Section 1256 does not  apply to the forward contract.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2 except that K  disposed of the forward contract on August 1, 1993 for $10,000. Pursuant  to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, K   does not recognize the $10,000 gain. K's basis in the machine is  $250,000 (the amount fixed by the forward contract), regardless of the  amount in dollars that K actually pays to acquire the Sf500,000 when K  pays for the machine. K has a payable with a booking date of August 1,  1993, payable on September 1, 1993 for 500,000 Swiss francs. Thus, K  will realize exchange gain or loss on the difference between the amount  booked on August 1, 1993 and the amount paid on September 1, 1993 under  Sec. 1.988-2(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1992, K enters into a contract with S,  a Swiss machine repair firm, to pay 500,000 Swiss francs for repairs to  be performed on June 1, 1992. Under the contract, K is not obligated to  pay for the repairs until September 1, 1992. On February 1, 1992, K  enters into a foreign currency forward agreement to purchase 500,000  Swiss francs for $250,000 for delivery on August 1, 1992. K properly  identifies the executory contract and the hedge in accordance with  paragraph (b)(3) of this section. On June 1, 1992, S performs the repair  services. Assume that under K's method of accounting this date is the  accrual date. On August 1, 1992, K takes delivery of the 500,000 Swiss  francs (in exchange for $250,000) under the forward contract. On the  same day, K deposits the Sf500,000 in a separate account with a bank and  properly identifies the transaction as a continuation of the hedged  executory contract. On September 1, 1992, K makes payment of the  Sf500,000 in the account to S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the hedge is integrated  with the executory contract. Therefore K is deemed to have paid $250,000  for the services and there is no exchange gain or loss on the foreign  currency forward contract or on the disposition of Sf500,000 in the  account. Any interest on the Swiss francs in the account is included in  income but is not considered part of the hedge (because the amount paid  for the services must be set on or before the accrual date). In  addition, no exchange gain or loss is recognized on the payable in  existence from June 1, 1992, to September 1, 1992. Section 1256 does not  apply to the forward contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1992, K enters into a contract with S,  a Swiss machine manufacturer, to pay 500,000 Swiss francs for delivery  of a machine on June 1, 1993. Under the contract, K is not obligated to  pay for the machine until September 1, 1993. On February 1, 1992, K  enters into a foreign currency forward agreement to purchase 250,000  Swiss francs for $125,000 for delivery on September 1, 1993. K properly  identifies the executory contract and the hedge in accordance with  paragraph (b)(3) of this section. On June 1, 1993, K takes delivery of  the machine. Assume that under K's method of accounting the delivery  date is the accrual date. Assume further that the exchange rate is Sf1 =  $.50 on June 1, 1993. On August 30, 1993, K purchases Sf250,000 for  $135,000. On September 1, 1993, K takes delivery of the 250,000 Swiss  francs (in exchange for $125,000) under the forward contract and makes  payment of 500,000 Swiss francs (the Sf250,000 received under the  contract plus the Sf250,000 purchased on August 30, 1993) to S. Assume  the spot rate on September 1, 1993, is 1 Sf = $.5420 (Sf250,000 equal  $135,500).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the partial hedge is  integrated with the executory contract. K is deemed to have paid  $250,000 for the machine [$125,000 on the hedged portion of the  Sf500,000 and $125,000 ($.50, the spot rate on June 1, 1993, times  Sf250,000) on the unhedged portion of the Sf500,000]. K's basis in the  machine therefore is $250,000. K recognizes no exchange gain or loss on  the foreign currency forward contract but K will realize exchange gain  of $500 on the disposition of the Sf250,000 purchased on August 30, 1993  under Sec. 1.988-2(a). In addition, exchange loss is realized on the  unhedged portion of the payable in existence from June 1, 1993, to  September 1, 1993. Thus, K will realize exchange loss of $10,500  ($125,000 booked less $135,500 paid) under Sec. 1.988-2(c) on the  payable. Section 1256 does not apply to the forward contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1990, K enters into a contract with S,  a Swiss steel manufacturer, to buy steel for 1,000,000 Swiss francs (Sf)  for delivery and payment on December 31, 1990. On January 1, 1990, the  spot rate is Sf1 = $.50, the U.S. dollar interest rate is 10% compounded  annually, and the Swiss franc rate is 5% compounded annually. Under K's  method of accounting, the delivery date is the accrual date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assume that on January 1, 1990, K enters into a foreign  currency forward contract to buy Sf1,000,000 for $523,800 for delivery  on December 31, 1990. K properly identifies the executory contract and  the hedge in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Pursuant  to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the forward contract  constitutes a hedge. Assuming that the requirements of paragraph  (b)(2)(i) of this section are satisfied, the executory contract to buy  steel and the forward contract are integrated under paragraph (b)(1) of  this section. Thus, K is deemed to have paid $523,800 for the steel and  will have a basis in the steel of $523,800. No gain or loss is realized  with respect to the forward contract and section 1256 does not apply to  such contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section, the forward contract entered into on  January 1, 1990, and the forward contract entered into on July 1, 1990,  constitute a hedge. Assuming that the requirements of paragraph  (b)(2)(i) of this section are satisfied, the executory contract to buy  steel and the forward agreements are integrated under paragraph (b)(1)  of this section. Thus, K is deemed to have paid $525,100 for the steel  (the forward price in the second forward agreement of $542,900 less the  gain on the first forward agreement of $17,800) and will have a basis in  the steel of $525,100. No gain is realized with respect to the forward  contracts and section 1256 does not apply to such contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assume instead that on January 1, 1990, K enters into a foreign  currency forward contract to buy Sf1,000,000 for $512,200 for delivery  on July 1, 1990. K properly identifies the executory contract and the  hedge in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. On July 1,  1990, when the spot rate is Sf1 = $.53, K enters into a historical rate  rollover of its $17,800 gain ($530,000-$512,200) on the forward  agreement. Thus, K enters into a second foreign currency forward  agreement to buy Sf1,000,000 for $524,210 for delivery on December 31,  1990. (The forward price of $524,210 is the market forward price on July  1, 1990, for the purchase of Sf1,000,000 for delivery on December 31,  1990, of $542,900 less the $17,800 gain on January 1, 1990, contract and  less the time value of such gain of $890.) K properly identifies the  second forward agreement as a hedge in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)  of this section. On December 31, 1990, when the spot rate is Sf1 = $.54,  K takes delivery of the Sf1,000,000 (in exchange for $524,210) and  purchases the steel for Sf1,000,000. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)  of this section, the forward contract entered into on January 1, 1990,  and the forward contract entered into on July 1, 1990, which  incorporates the rollover of K's gain on the January 1, 1990, contract,  constitute a hedge. Assuming that the requirements of paragraph  (b)(2)(i) of this section are satisfied, the executory contract to buy  steel and the forward agreements are integrated under paragraph (b)(1)  of this section. Because the period from the rollover date to the date  payment is made under the executory contract does not exceed 183 days,  the $890 of interest income is considered part of the hedge and is not  recognized. Thus, K is deemed to have paid $524,210 for the steel and  will have a basis in the steel of $524,210. No gain is realized with  respect to the forward contracts and section 1256 does not apply to such  contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Assume instead that on January 1, 1990, K purchases Sf952,380.95  (the present value of Sf1,000,000 to be paid on December 31, 1990) for  $476,190.48 and on the same day deposits the Swiss francs in a separate  bank account that bears interest at a rate of 5%, compounded annually. K  properly identifies the transaction as a hedged executory contract. Over  the period beginning January 1, 1990, and ending December 31, 1990, K  receives Sf47,619.05 in interest on the account that is included in  income and that has a basis of $25,714.29. (Assume that under  Sec. 1.988-2(b)(1), K uses the spot rate of Sf1 = $.54 to translate the  interest income). On December 31, 1990, K makes payment of the  Sf1,000,000 principal and accrued interest in the account to S. Pursuant  to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the principal in the bank  account and the interest constitute a hedge. Under paragraph (b)(1) of  this section, the hedge is integrated with the executory contract.  Therefore K is deemed to have paid $501,904.77 (the basis of the  principal deposited plus the basis of the interest) for the steel and  there is no exchange gain or loss on the disposition of the Sf1,000,000.  K's basis in the steel therefore is $501,904.77.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> References to this paragraph (b).

Except as otherwise provided in this  section, the rules of this section shall apply to qualified hedging  transactions, hedged executory contracts and transactions described in  paragraph (c) of this section entered into on or after September 21,  1989. This section shall apply even if the transaction being hedged  (e.g., the debt instrument) was entered into or acquired prior to such  date.

[T.D. 8400, 57 FR 9199, Mar. 17, 1992, as amended at T.D. 9598, 77 FR  54809, Sept. 6, 2012]    Sec. 1.988-5T  Section 988(d) hedging transactions (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(6)(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Legging out. With respect to a qualifying debt instrument and  hedge that are properly identified as a qualified hedging transaction,  ``legging out'' of integrated treatment under this paragraph (a) means  that the taxpayer disposes of or otherwise terminates all or any portion  of the qualifying debt instrument or the hedge prior to maturity of the  qualified hedging transaction, or the taxpayer changes a material term  of the qualifying debt instrument (for example, exercises an option to  change the interest rate or index, or the maturity date) or the hedge  (for example, changes the interest or exchange rates underlying the  hedge, or the expiration date) prior to maturity of the qualified  hedging transaction. A taxpayer that disposes of or terminates a  qualified hedging transaction (that is, disposes of or terminates both  the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge in their entirety on the  same day) shall be considered to have disposed of or otherwise  terminated the synthetic debt instrument rather than legging out. If a  taxpayer legs out of integrated treatment, the following rules shall  apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The transaction will be treated as a qualified hedging  transaction during the time the requirements of this paragraph (a) were  satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If all of the instruments comprising the hedge (each such  instrument, a component) are disposed of or otherwise terminated, the  qualifying debt instrument shall be treated as sold for its fair market  value on the date the hedge is disposed of or otherwise terminated (the  leg-out date), and any gain or loss (including gain or loss resulting  from factors other than movements in exchange rates) from the  identification date to the leg-out date is realized and recognized on  the leg-out date. The spot rate on the leg-out date shall be used to  determine exchange gain or loss on the debt instrument for the period  beginning on the leg-out date and ending on the date such instrument  matures or is disposed   of or otherwise terminated. Proper adjustment must be made to reflect  any gain or loss taken into account. The netting rule of Sec. 1.988- 2(b)(8) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a hedge has more than one component (and such components have  been properly identified as being part of the qualified hedging  transaction) and at least one but not all of the components that  comprise the hedge has been disposed of or otherwise terminated, or if  part of any component of the hedge has been terminated (whether a hedge  consists of a single or multiple components), the date such component  (or part thereof) is disposed of or terminated shall be considered the  leg-out date and the qualifying debt instrument shall be treated as sold  for its fair market value in accordance with the rules of paragraph  (a)(6)(ii)(B) of this section on such leg-out date. In addition, all of  the remaining components (or parts thereof) that have not been disposed  of or otherwise terminated shall be treated as sold for their fair  market value on the leg-out date, and any gain or loss from the  identification date to the leg-out date is realized and recognized on  the leg-out date. To the extent relevant, the spot rate on the leg-out  date shall be used to determine exchange gain or loss on the remaining  components (or parts thereof) for the period beginning on the leg-out  date and ending on the date such components (or parts thereof) are  disposed of or otherwise terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the qualifying debt instrument is disposed of or otherwise  terminated in whole or in part, the date of such disposition or  termination shall be considered the leg-out date. Accordingly, the hedge  (including all components making up the hedge in their entirety) that is  part of the qualified hedging transaction shall be treated as sold for  its fair market value on the leg-out date, and any gain or loss from the  identification date to the leg-out date is realized and recognized on  the leg-out date. To the extent relevant, the spot rate on the leg-out  date shall be used to determine exchange gain or loss on the hedge  (including all components thereof) for the period beginning on the leg- out date and ending on the date such hedge is disposed of or otherwise  terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(8)(iii) of this section  (regarding identification by the Commissioner), the part of the  qualified hedging transaction that has not been terminated (that is, the  remaining debt instrument in its entirety even if partially hedged, or  the remaining components of the hedge) cannot be part of a qualified  hedging transaction for any period subsequent to the leg-out date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If a taxpayer legs out of a qualified hedging transaction and  realizes a gain with respect to the disposed of or terminated debt  instrument or hedge, then paragraph (a)(6)(ii)(B), (C), and (D) of this  section, as appropriate, will not apply if during the period beginning  30 days before the leg-out date and ending 30 days after that date the  taxpayer enters into another transaction that, taken together with any  remaining components of the hedge, hedges at least 50 percent of the  remaining currency flow with respect to the qualifying debt instrument  that was part of the qualified hedging transaction or, if appropriate,  an equivalent amount under the hedge (or any remaining components  thereof) that was part of the qualified hedging transaction. Similarly,  in a case in which a hedge has multiple components that are part of a  qualified hedging transaction, if the taxpayer legs out of a qualified  hedging transaction by terminating one such component or a part of one  or more such components and realizes a gain with respect to the  terminated component, components, or portions thereof, then paragraphs  (a)(6)(ii)(B), (C), and (D) of this section, as appropriate, will not  apply if the remaining components of the hedge (including parts thereof)  by themselves hedge at least 50 percent of the remaining currency flow  with respect to the qualifying debt instrument that was part of the  qualified hedging transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> through (a)(9)(iv) Example 10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> K is a U.S. corporation with the U.S. dollar as its  functional currency. On January 1, 2013, K borrows 100 British pounds  () for two years at a 10% rate of interest   payable on December 31 of each year with no principal payment due until  maturity on December 31, 2014. Assume that the spot rate on January 1,  2013, is 1=$1. On the same date, K enters into two swap  contracts with an unrelated counterparty that economically results in  the transformation of the fixed rate 100 borrowing to a  floating rate dollar borrowing. The terms of the swaps are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Swap #1, Currency swap. On January 1, 2013, K will exchange  100 for $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> On December 31 of both 2013 and 2014, K will exchange $8 for  10;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> On December 31, 2014, K will exchange $100 for 100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Swap #2, Interest rate swap. On December 31 of both 2013 and  2014, K will pay LIBOR times a notional principal amount of $100 and  will receive 8% times the same $100 notional principal amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assume that K properly identifies the pound borrowing and the  swap contracts as a qualified hedging transaction as provided in  paragraph (a)(8) of this section and that the other relevant  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section (regarding  identification by the Commissioner), the pound borrowing and currency  swap cannot be part of a qualified hedging transaction for any period  subsequent to the leg-out date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assume the facts are the same as in paragraph (iii) of this  section except that on January 1, 2014, the U.S. dollar LIBOR rate of  interest is 7% rather than 9%. When K terminates swap 2, K will  realize gain of $0.93 (the present value of $1) received with respect to  the termination on January 1, 2014. Fifty percent or more of the  remaining pound cash flow of the pound borrowing remains hedged after  the termination of swap 2. Accordingly, under paragraph  (a)(6)(ii)(F) of this section, paragraphs (a)(6)(ii)(B) and (C) of this  section do not apply and the gain on swap 1 and the loss on the  qualifying debt instrument is not taken into account. Thus, K will  include in income $0.93 realized from termination of swap 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> through (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective/applicability date.
