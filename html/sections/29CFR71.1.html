The regulations apply to all records which are contained in  systems of records maintained by, or under the control of, the  Department of Labor and which are retrieved by an individual's name or  personal identifier.

This system is maintained by and under  the control of the Employment Standards Administration's Office of  Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), and, as such, all records  contained in the OWCP claims file, as well as all copies of such  documents retained and/or maintained by the injured worker's employing  agency, are official records of the OWCP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The protection, release, inspection and copying of records  covered by DOL/GOVT-1 shall be accomplished in accordance with the  rules, guidelines and provisions of this part, as well as with part 70  of this subtitle, and with the notice of the systems of records and  routine uses published in the Federal Register. All questions relating  to access/disclosure, and/or the amendment of FECA records maintained by  the OWCP or an employing agency, are to be resolved in accordance with  this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> While an employing agency may establish procedures that an  injured employee or beneficiary should follow in requesting access to  documents it maintains, any decision issued in response to such a  request must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of  Labor.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any administrative appeal taken from a denial issued by the  employing agency shall be filed with the Solicitor of Labor in  accordance with Sec. Sec. 71.7 and 71.9 of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> No agency other than the OWCP has authority to issue  determinations in response to requests for the correction or amendment  of records contained in or covered by DOL/GOVT-1. Any request for  correction or amendment received by an employing agency must be referred  to the OWCP for review and decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the government-wide system of records entitled DOL/GOVT-2  (Job Corps Student Records), a system maintained by and under the  control of the Employment and Training Administration, the regulations  of this Department shall govern, including the procedure for requesting  access to, or amendment of the records, as well as appeals therefrom,  shall govern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions.
