                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When the contractor will perform work under a contract on an Indian reservation, the Contracting Officer may supplement the clause in 352.270-3 by adding specific Indian preference requirements of the Tribe on whose reservation the work is to be performed. The contracting activity and the Tribe shall jointly develop supplemental requirements for the contract. Supplemental preference requirements shall represent a further implementation of the requirements of section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 and require the approval of the affected program director and OGC-GLD, or a regional attorney, before the Contracting Officer adds them to a solicitation and resultant contract. Any supplemental preference requirements the Contracting Officer adds to the clause in 352.270-3 shall also be part of the solicitation and clearly identified, to ensure uniform understanding of the additional requirements by all prospective bidders or offerors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nothing in this part shall preclude tribes from independently developing and enforcing their own Tribal preference requirements. Such independently developed Tribal preference requirements shall not, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, become a requirement in contracts covered under this 370.2, and shall not conflict with any Federal statutory or regulatory requirement concerning the award and administration of contracts.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 370.3_Acquisitions Involving Human Subjects</p>
