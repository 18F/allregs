Since section 409(b)(5) of the act requires that the Commissioner publish notice of a petition for the establishment of a food additive regulation within 30 days after filing, notice of a petition relating to a definition and standard of identity shall also be published within that time limitation if it includes a request, so designated, for

the establishment of a regulation pertaining to a food additive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a petition for a definition and standard of identity contains a proposal for a food additive regulation, and the petitioner fails to designate it as such, the Commissioner, upon determining that the petition includes a proposal for a food additive regulation, shall so notify the petitioner and shall thereafter proceed in accordance with the regulations in part 171 of this chapter.</p>
