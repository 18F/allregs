Conduct a full velocity traverse using the stack velocity measurement  device as shown in figure 3 of this Appendix A to this Subpart, or use  Method 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Continuously record a velocity  reference point reading during each test run using a chart recorder or  once every 20 seconds if using Method 1A. Calculate the volumetric flow  rate using the gas velocity, moisture content, and the stack cross- sectional area. For the purposes of this protocol, the static pressure  shall be assumed to be atmospheric, the molar density correction factor  in the stack to be 1.0, and the moisture content to be 2 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Integrated VOC sample. Collect integrated VOC gas samples at the  sampling port in the exhaust stack using a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A,  Method 25 Total Combustion Analysis (TCA) sampling apparatus consisting  of two evacuated 9-liter tanks, each equipped with flow controllers,  vacuum gauges, and probes, as shown in figure 4 of Appendix A of this  Subpart. Use 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 25, SCAQMD Method 25.1  (incorporated by   reference--Sec. 59.213 of this subpart), or equivalent, for analysis.  Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and non-methane organic carbon  are analyzed by the TCA and TCA/Flame Ionization Detector (FID) methods.  Oxygen content is determined by gas chromatography using a thermal  conductivity detector. Clean particulate filters between use by heating  to 760 degrees Celsius (1400 degrees Fahrenheit) while using compressed  air as a carrier for cleaning and purging.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Continuous organic emissions monitor. A continuous organic  emissions monitor which uses a continuous FID shall be used for each  test run to measure the real time organic concentration of the exhaust  as methane. Record the emission monitor response in parts per million  continuously during the sampling period using a chart recorder or at  least once every 10 seconds. The VOC analyzer shall be operated as  prescribed in the manufacturer's directions unless otherwise noted in  this protocol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Pretest procedure. (1) Charcoal lighter material--charcoal.  Before each test run, remove charcoal from a sealed bag that has been  stored for at least 72 hours in a humidity and temperature controlled  room which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this  section and weight out 0.9 kilograms (2 pounds) of charcoal briquettes,  to the nearest whole briquette over 0.9 kilograms (2 pounds), of uniform  shape with no broken pieces using an analytical balance. Reseal the bag.  Charcoal must be ignited within 10 minutes after removal from bag. A  sealed or resealed bag of charcoal cannot be stored at the test site for  greater than 45 minutes. It must be returned to a humidity and  temperature controlled room from 72 hours. The lighter material must be  purchased, stored, weighed, and handled the same as the barbecue  charcoal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the reference VOC emission tests using an electric probe,  place a single layer of charcoal, slightly larger than the area/circle  of the electric probe heating element, onto the grate. Place the heating  element on top of this first layer and cover the heating element with  the remaining charcoal briquettes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the ignition VOC emissions tests, arrange the briquettes on  the barbecue grate in the manner specified by the ignition  manufacturer's directions. If these manufacturer's directions do not  specify a stacking arrangement for the briquettes, randomly stack the  briquettes in a pile using the stacking ring described in paragraph  (f)(3)(ix) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Charcoal lighter material--or impregnated charcoal. Store,  handle, weigh, and stack barbecue charcoal that is designed to be lit  without the packaging, the same as in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.  For those products which require both the package and charcoal be lit,  weigh the whole package--do not remove charcoal. Weigh an empty package  (not the same one to be used during the test). Subtract the package  weight from the overall weight of the package and charcoal. The full  package and empty package must be stored, handled, and weighed the same  as in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. If the difference (the charcoal  weight) is between 0.7 to 1.4 kilograms (1.5 to 3.0 pounds), the test  may proceed. The emissions measured (E) in Equation 5 of paragraph  (k)(7) of this section must be adjusted to a 0.9 kilogram (2-pound)  charge. Place packaged barbecue charcoal on the grate in the manner  specified by the manufacturer's directions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Initial meteorological and environmental criteria in paragraph  (d) shall be complied with.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The stack velocity must be set before each day of testing at 140  [9 meters per minute (450 [30 feet per minute) by performing a velocity  traverse as specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. The velocity  will be attained by adjusting the axial fan speed using a rheostat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The fireplace shall be conditioned at the start of each day  before sampling tests by using a grill ignited by the electric probe. If  a time period of over 60 minutes between sampling test runs occur, the  condition step must be repeated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Before each test run, leak check the continuous organic  emissions monitor by blocking the flow to the probe. Allow the  instrument to warm up for   the duration specified by the manufacturer's directions. Select the 0 to  100 parts per million range. Check the battery level and hydrogen  pressure. Zero with hydrocarbon-free air (40.1 parts per million  hydrocarbons as methane) span with 90 parts per million methane in ultra  pure air. Zero and span another instrument selection range if needed for  test purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Before the testing program begins, establish a point of average  concentration of organics in the stack by using a continuous organic  emissions monitor and a grill with charcoal ignited by the electric  probe 40 minutes after initial release of emissions. Record the  continuous organic emissions monitor traverse data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Prepare the integrated VOC sampling equipment and perform the  required leak checks. Fit the probes with nozzles housing two micron  particulate filters. Insert the probes and nozzles into the sampling  port to draw a sample of the exhaust gas from the point of average  organic concentration as determined from the continuous organic  emissions monitor sample traverse described in paragraph (h)(4) of this  section. Also, position the nozzles such that they point downstream in  the stack. Obtain the samples concurrently and continuously over the  test run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Insert the continuous organic emissions monitor probe into the  sampling port to draw a sample of the exhaust gas from the point of  average organic concentration as determined from the continuous organic  emissions monitor sample traverse described in paragraph (h)(7) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Test procedure. The labeled directions, as defined in paragraph  (e) of this section, shall be followed throughout the course of the  testing. In cases where the directions are incompatible with this  protocol, circumvent the intent of this protocol, or are unclear  (subject to different interpretations) and inadequate, the Administrator  must be informed in writing of the nature of the conflict, as well as  the proposed resolution, prior to commencing testing. When the labeled  directions for a charcoal lighter material do not fall within the  testing guidelines of this protocol, the protocol may only be modified  upon written approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Place the bottom of the barbecue grill on the floor of the  fireplace, 5 centimeters (2 inches) from the rear wall. Ignite charcoal  as specified by manufacturer's labeled directions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For electric probe ignition, carefully remove probe without  disturbing charcoal after 10 minutes of operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For fluid ignition, simultaneously match light fluid on charcoal  and fluid that has fallen to the bottom of the grill.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Place the grill temperature probe 11 centimeters (4.5 inches)  above the top of the charcoal immediately after the charcoal lighter  material flame goes out, or before, if the lighter material does not  flame.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Conduct at least six test runs for both the electric probe  ignition and for the lighter material being evaluated. Alternate these  lighter material for all 12 runs. All runs must be conducted over 3  consecutive days or less. Alternatively, baseline emissions testing  (using the electric probe) may be applied to other test runs provided  the test runs occur within 4 months of the baseline testing. Integrated  VOC sampling and continuous organic emissions monitoring begin for each  test run when the charcoal lighter material and/or materials start to  generate/release organics (this will be the time of pouring for lighter  fluids and the time of ignition for most other ignition sources).  Option: Because the manufacturer of treated or impregnated charcoal  supplies both the lighter material and barbecue charcoal, they may apply  the 9 grams VOC per start emission limit as an absolute value without an  adjustment for the VOC emissions from an electric probe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Sampling ends for each test run when all the following  conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The temperature 11 centimeters (4.5 inches) above the maximum  height of the briquette pile, using the grill temperature probe  described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, is at least 93  degrees Celsius (200 degrees Fahrenheit);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The continuous organic emissions monitor is reading below 30  parts per million for at least 2 minutes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The test sampling has continued for 25 minutes (but not more)  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The charcoal surface is 70 percent covered with ash (to be  documented with photograph on top and 60 degrees above the horizon).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> During the sampling test runs, temperatures (excluding ambient)  and continuous organic emission monitor readings shall be recorded and  shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.  Humidity, wind speed, and ambient temperature readings shall be  monitored and shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (b) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Collect one blank sample for VOC and one ambient air sample  during one run of each day per paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Post-run procedure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Record temperatures (including ambient),  humidity, wind speed, and continuous organic emissions monitor reading.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Record the drift using zero and span gases. Leak check and span  the continuous organic emissions monitor as described in paragraph  (h)(6) of this section for the next run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Leak check and disassemble the integrated VOC sampling equipment  as described in Method 25 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A or SCAQMD Method  25.1 (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 59.213 of this subpart), or  equivalent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Thoroughly clean grill surfaces of all residue before conducting  next ignition run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Calculations. Calculations shall be carried out to at least one  significant digit beyond that of the acquired data, and then rounded off  after final calculation to two significant digits for each run. All  rounding off of numbers should be in accordance with the American  Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E 380-93, Standard Practice for  Use of the SI International System of Units, procedures (incorporated by  reference--see Sec. 59.213 of this subpart).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Calculate the average stack reference point temperature during  sampling (tsr).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calculate the average measured velocities (in meters per minute  [feet per minute]): Traverse (ut), traverse reference point  (utr), and reference point during sampling (usr).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Calculate the corrected average sampling velocity  (us) by applying Equation 2: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11SE98.003</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Calculate the average flow rate (Qs) in cubic meters  per minute (cubic feet per minute) by applying Equation 3: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11SE98.004  Where  A=Duct cross-sectional area, (square meters [square feet]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Correct the flow rate to dry standard conditions  (Qds) by applying Equation 4.
