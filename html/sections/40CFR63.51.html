This limitation shall not be less stringent than the MACT floor.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limitation for new sources means the emission limitation which is not less stringent than the emission limitation achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, and which reflects the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable by sources in the category or subcategory to which such emission standard applies.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) floor means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> For existing sources:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources in the United States (for which the Administrator has emissions information), excluding those sources that have, within 18 months before the emission standard is proposed or within 30 months before such standard is promulgated, whichever is later, first achieved a level of emission rate or emission reduction which complies, or would comply if the source is not subject to such standard, with the lowest achievable emission rate (as defined in section 171 of the Act) applicable to the source category and prevailing at the time, in the category or subcategory, for categories and subcategories of stationary sources with 30 or more sources; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> The average emission limitation achieved by the best performing five sources (for which the Administrator has or could reasonably obtain emissions information) in the category or subcategory, for categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> For new sources, the emission limitation achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source.</p><p class="depth0">New affected source means the collection of equipment, activities, or both, that if constructed after the issuance of a section 112(j) permit for the source pursuant to Sec. 63.52, is subject to the applicable MACT emission limitation for new sources. Each permit must define the term ``new affected source,'' which will be the same as the ``affected source'' unless a different collection is warranted based on consideration of factors including:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Emission reduction impacts of controlling individual sources versus groups of sources;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Cost effectiveness of controlling individual equipment;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Flexibility to accommodate common control strategies;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Cost/benefits of emissions averaging;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> Incentives for pollution prevention;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> Feasibility and cost of controlling processes that share common equipment (e.g., product recovery devices);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(7)</em> Feasibility and cost of monitoring; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(8)</em> Other relevant factors.</p><p class="depth2">Permitting authority means the permitting authority as defined in part 70 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2">Research or laboratory activities means activities whose primary purpose is to conduct research and development into new processes and products where such activities are operated under the close supervision of technically trained personnel and are not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale in commerce, except in a de minimis manner; and where the source is not in a source category, specifically

addressing research or laboratory activities, that is listed pursuant to section 112(c)(7) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2">Section 112(j) deadline means the date 18 months after the date for which a relevant standard is scheduled to be promulgated under this part, except that for all major sources listed in the source category schedule for which a relevant standard is scheduled to be promulgated by November 15, 1994, the section 112(j) deadline is November 15, 1996, and for all major sources listed in the source category schedule for which a relevant standard is scheduled to be promulgated by November 15, 1997, the section 112(j) deadline is December 15, 1999.</p><p class="depth2">Similar source means that equipment or collection of equipment that, by virtue of its structure, operability, type of emissions and volume and concentration of emissions, is substantially equivalent to the new affected source and employs control technology for control of emissions of hazardous air pollutants that is practical for use on the new affected source.</p><p class="depth2">Source category schedule for standards means the schedule for promulgating MACT standards issued pursuant to section 112(e) of the Act.
