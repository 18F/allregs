                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Limited application of section. The rules of this section shall apply to a foreign corporation only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under the laws of a foreign country or possession of the United States the foreign income tax of the corporation for the taxable year depends upon the extent to which distributions are made by such corporation from its earnings and profits for the taxable year, so that the rate of such tax for the taxable year on income which is distributed differs from the rate of such tax for such year on the income which is not distributed, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is a single first-tier corporation, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is for the taxable year in a chain or group from which the United States shareholder receives a minimum distribution in respect of which the minimum overall tax burden is determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Sec. 1.963-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Foreign income tax determined as though no distributions were made. The foreign income tax on the pretax and predistribution earnings and profits of the foreign corporation for the taxable year shall (solely for the purpose of determining the effective foreign tax rate under paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.963-2) be determined as if the foreign corporation made no distributions for the taxable year. However, notwithstanding the second sentence of paragraph (d)(1) of Sec. 1.963-2, where the United States shareholder owns the stock (with respect to which the election under section 963 is made) in such corporation by reason of stock owned through a chain of ownership described in section 958(a) and the foreign income tax of such corporation for the taxable year decreases as distributions are made from its earnings and profits, the rule in the preceding sentence shall not apply if the electing United States shareholder does not actually receive for the taxable year its proportionate share of the earnings and profits which are actually distributed. In such case, the foreign income tax on pretax and predistribution earnings and profits shall be the actual foreign income tax of such corporation, computed on the basis of the distributions which are made. For example, assume that a second-tier foreign corporation in a chain has pretax and predistribution earnings of $100 for the taxable year and that foreign law imposes on such corporation a foreign income tax of 50 percent of the pretax earnings and profits minus dividends for such year and of 20 percent of such dividends. If the second-tier foreign corporation distributes $20 of earnings and profits to a first-tier foreign corporation which is part of the same chain, and if the first-tier corporation retains the dividend so received, the foreign income tax of the second-tier foreign corporation shall be considered to be the tax actually paid for the taxable year, that is, $44 (50 percent of $80 plus 20 percent of $20). If the first-tier foreign corporation distributes the dividend so received, the foreign income tax of the second-tier foreign corporation shall be considered to be $50 (50 percent of $100). For purposes of this paragraph, the principles of paragraph (b)(3) of Sec. 1.963-4 shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Minimum distribution--(1) Single first-tier corporation.

The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Domestic corporation M directly owns 80 percent of the one class of stock of single first-tier corporation B, which for 1964 has $100 of pretax earnings and profits on which is imposed a foreign income tax of 40 percent of pretax earnings and profits minus dividends for the taxable year and of 20 percent of the amount of such dividends. Both corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. The effective foreign tax rate applicable to B Corporation, as determined under paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.963-2, is 40 percent, and the statutory percentage under paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.963-2 for 1964 is 38 percent. Corporation M receives a minimum distribution for 1964 if it receives from B Corporation's earnings and profits for such year $22.80, that is, 80 percent of $28.50, the distribution which would be made if there were distributed that amount of earnings and profits which, together with the foreign income tax at the rate effectively applicable to pretax earnings and profits to which such distribution is attributable, equals 38 percent of $100. Such distribution may be determined by solving for ``d'' in the following formula:</p><p class="depth0">d=$38-0.20d-0.40($38-d)</p><p class="depth0">d=$38-0.20d-$15.20+0.40d</p><p class="depth0">d=$22.80+0.20d</p><p class="depth0">0.80  d=$22.80</p><p class="depth0">d=$22.80/0.80</p><p class="depth0">d=$28.50</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Domestic corporation M directly owns 80 percent of the one class of stock of each of controlled foreign corporations A and B, which constitute a group and each of which for 1964 has pretax earnings and profits of $100. All corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporation A is subject to foreign income tax at a flat rate of 40 percent; and B Corporation is subject to a foreign income tax of 40 percent of $100 minus dividends for the taxable year and of 20 percent of the amount of such dividends. The effective foreign tax rate with respect to the group, as determined under paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.963-2, is 40 percent, and the statutory percentage under paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.963-2 for 1964 is 38 percent. Corporation B distributes $25 for 1964 toward a minimum distribution from the group which is not a pro rata minimum distribution. The minimum distribution by the group for 1964 with respect to M Corporation is determined as follows:

other earnings and profits of such foreign corporation for such year are distributed in a subsequent taxable year of such foreign corporation to such shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Illustration. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> All the income of controlled foreign corporation B, wholly owned directly by domestic corporation M, is taxed by foreign country Y, the tax laws of which impose at the local level a corporate income tax of 10 percent of earnings and profits (before reduction for income taxes) and, at the national level, an income tax of 30 percent of such earnings and profits reduced by the local tax and by any profits which are distributed. Also, at the national level, a tax of 20 percent is imposed on B Corporation on the dividends which are paid for the taxable year. Both corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. For 1963, B Corporation has earnings and profits (before reduction by income taxes) of $100. B Corporation is not a less developed country corporation under section 902(d). For 1963, M Corporation makes a first-tier election with respect to B Corporation and receives a minimum distribution. Corporation B has no 1964 earnings and profits, and its remaining 1963 earnings and profits are distributed late in 1964. The amount of the minimum distribution required to be received by M Corporation for 1963 and the United States tax with respect to the 1963 earnings and profits of B Corporation are determined as follows, assuming a United States corporate income tax rate of 52 percent (instead of 50 percent) for 1964 and no surtax exemption under section 11(c) for either year:</p><p class="depth0">1963Effective foreign tax rate which obtains if no                       37%</p><p class="depth0">earnings and profits of B Corporation are</p><p class="depth0">distributed [($100x0.10)+ ([$100-</p><p class="depth0"><em>($100x0.10)]x0.30)</em>]/$100...........................Minimum percentage of earnings and profits required                  68%</p><p class="depth0">under section 963(b) to be distributed, given a 37</p><p class="depth0">percent effective foreign tax rate.................Amount of earnings and profits (before reduction by               $68.00</p><p class="depth0">foreign income tax) to which minimum distribution</p><p class="depth0">would be attributable if the effective foreign tax</p><p class="depth0">rate of 37 percent obtained (0.68x$100)............Minimum distribution required to be received by M</p><p class="depth0">Corporation, i.e., such an amount that is $68 less</p><p class="depth0">the foreign income tax on such $68, determined by</p><p class="depth0">letting ``d'' equal the dividend in the algebraic</p><p class="depth0">equation:</p><p class="depth0">d=$68 - (0.10 x $68) - 0.30 ($68 - [0.10 x $68] -</p><p class="depth0">d) - 0.20d....................................</p><p class="depth0">d=$68 - $6.80 - ($20.40 - $2.04 - 0.30d) - 0.20d</p><p class="depth0">d=$61.20 - $20.40 + $2.04 + 0.30d - 0.20d.......</p><p class="depth0">d=$42.84 + 0.10d................................</p><p class="depth0">0.90d=$42.84......................................</p><p class="depth0">d=$42.84/0.90, or...............................              $47.60Gross-up under section 78, using the actual foreign               $20.40</p><p class="depth0">income tax imposed on pretax profits to which are</p><p class="depth0">attributable the earnings and profits distributed</p><p class="depth0">($6.80+0.30 [$61.20-$47.60]+0.20 [$47.60]).........Taxable income of M Corporation for 1963                          $68.00</p><p class="depth0"><em>($47.60+$20.40)</em>....................................U.S. tax before foreign tax credit ($68x0.52).......              $35.36Foreign tax credit ($47.60/$47.60x $20.40)..........              $20.40U.S. tax payable for 1963 ($35.36- $20.40)..........              $14.96Overall U.S. and foreign income tax rate                          47.20%</p><p class="depth0">[$14.96+$20.40+($32x0.37)]/$100....................</p><p class="depth0">1964</p><p class="depth0">Dividend received by M Corporation ($32-[0.37x$32]).              $20.16Gross-up under section 78, using the foreign income               $11.84</p><p class="depth0">tax paid or accrued on pretax earnings and profits</p><p class="depth0">to which are attributable 1963 earnings and profits</p><p class="depth0">distributed during 1964 ($20.16/$20.16x[$32x 0.37])Taxable income of M Corporation for 1964                          $32.00</p><p class="depth0"><em>($20.16+$11.84)</em>....................................U.S. tax before foreign tax credit ($32x0.52).......              $16.64Foreign tax credit ($20.16/$20.16x $11.84)..........              $11.84U.S. tax payable ($16.64-$11.84)....................               $4.80</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If B Corporation were a less developed country corporation under section 902(d), there would be no gross-up under section 78 and the foreign tax credit of M Corporation would be $14.28 for 1963 ($47.60/[47.60+ $20.40]x$20.40), and $7.46 for 1964 ($20.16/ [$20.16+$11.84]x$11.84).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. For 1963, domestic corporation M receives a dividend of $21 from B Corporation which counts toward a minimum distribution from a group, determined by applying the special rules of paragraphs (b) and (c) of Sec. 1.963-4. Both corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. Foreign law imposes on B Corporation an income tax of 40 percent of the year's pretax earnings and profits, less dividends paid for such year, and of 20 percent of such dividends. Corporation M directly owns 70 percent of the one class of stock of B Corporation, which for 1963 has pretax and predistribution earnings and profits of $100. Corporation B is not a less developed country corporation under section 902(d). In late 1964, M Corporation receives a distribution of all of B Corporation's 1964 earnings and profits and of $25.20 from its 1963 earnings and profits. The foreign income tax of B Corporation deemed paid for 1963 by M Corporation under section 902(a) is based on the foreign income tax actually paid by B Corporation on an amount of pretax earnings and profits which, when reduced by the tax

so paid, equals the total dividend which is paid.
