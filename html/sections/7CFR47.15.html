                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When permissible. (1) Where the amount of the damages claimed,  either in the complaint or in the counterclaim, does not exceed $30,000  (excluding interest), an oral hearing shall not be held, unless deemed  necessary or desirable by the Fruit and Vegetable Programs or unless  granted by the examiner as defined in Sec. 47.2(i)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, upon application  of complainant or respondent setting forth the peculiar circumstances  making an oral hearing necessary for a proper presentation of the case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2))</em> shall be applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Request for hearing. Any party may request an oral hearing on  the facts by including such request in the complaint. Failure to request  an oral hearing within the time allowed for filing of the reply, or  within 10 days after the expiration of the time allowed for filing an  answer, shall constitute a waiver of such hearing, and any party so  failing to request an oral hearing will be deemed to have agreed that  the proceeding may be decided upon a record formed under the documentary  procedure provided in Sec. 47.20.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time, place, and manner. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If and when the proceeding has  reached the stage of oral hearing, the examiner, giving careful  consideration to the convenience of the parties, shall set a time for  hearing and shall file with the Hearing Clerk a notice stating the time  and place of hearing. Unless the parties otherwise agree, the place of  the hearing shall be the place in which the respondent is engaged in  business. This notice shall state whether the hearing will be conducted  by telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of  any individual expected to participate in the hearing and the examiner's  determination regarding the manner of the hearing shall be made in  accordance with paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section. If any  change in the time, place, or manner of the hearing is made, the  examiner shall file with the Hearing Clerk a notice of the change. The  notice of any change in the time, place, or manner of the hearing shall  be served on the parties, unless it is made during the course of an oral  hearing and made part of the transcript or recording, or actual notice  is given to the parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If and when the proceeding has reached the stage of oral  hearing, any party may move that the hearing be conducted by telephone  or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing  rather than by audio-visual telecommunication. Any motion that the  hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any  individual expected to attend the hearing must be accompanied by a  memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and  the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than by  audio-visual telecommunication.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 10 days after the examiner issues a notice stating the  manner in which the hearing is to be conducted, any party may move that  the examiner reconsider the manner in which the hearing is to be  conducted. Any motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by a  memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and  the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other   than in accordance with the examiner's notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The hearing shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication  unless the examiner determines that conducting the hearing by personal  attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected  to participate in the hearing; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual  telecommunication. If the examiner determines that a hearing conducted  by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United  States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the hearing, the  hearing shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who  is expected to participate in the hearing or by telephone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The examiner may, in his or her sole discretion or in response  to a motion by a party to the proceeding, conduct the hearing by  telephone if the examiner finds that a hearing conducted by telephone:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Would provide a full and fair evidentiary hearing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Would not prejudice any party; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual  telecommunication or personal attendance of any individual who is  expected to participate in the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Appearances--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Representation. In any proceeding under the  Act, the parties may appear in person or by counsel or other  representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure to appear. If any party to the proceeding, after being  duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing, the party shall be deemed  to have waived the right to an oral hearing in the proceeding. In the  event that a party appears at the hearing and no party appears for the  opposing side, the examiner may determine whether the party who is  present shall present his or her evidence, in whole or in part, in the  form of affidavits or by oral testimony.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Debarment of counsel or representative. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whenever, while a  proceeding is pending before him or her, the examiner finds that a  person acting as counsel or representative for any party to the  proceeding is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the  examiner may order that such person be precluded from further acting as  counsel or representative in such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary  may be taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall not be  delayed or suspended pending disposition of the appeal: Provided, That  the examiner may suspend the proceedings for a reasonable time for the  purpose of enabling the party to obtain other counsel or representative.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In case the examiner has issued an order precluding a person  from further acting as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the  examiner, within a reasonable time thereafter, shall submit to the  Secretary a report of the facts and circumstances surrounding the  issuance of the order and shall recommend what action the Secretary  should take respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or  representative in other proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter,  the Secretary may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue  such order respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or  representative in proceedings before the Secretary as the Secretary  finds to be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Order of proceeding. The complainant shall proceed first at the  hearing and shall have the burden of proof, except that a party  asserting a set-off or counterclaim shall have the burden of proof on  such issue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Written statements of direct testimony. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided  in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, each party must exchange with all  other parties a written narrative verified statement of the oral direct  testimony that the party will provide at any hearing to be conducted by  telephone; the direct testimony of each employee or agent of the party  that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing  to be conducted by telephone; and the direct testimony of each expert  witness that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any  hearing to be conducted by telephone. The written direct testimony of  witnesses shall be exchanged by the parties at   least 10 days prior to the hearing. The oral direct testimony provided  by a witness at a hearing conducted by telephone will be limited to the  presentation of the written direct testimony, unless the examiner finds  that oral direct testimony which is supplemental to the written direct  testimony would further the public interest and would not constitute  surprise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The parties shall not be required to exchange testimony in  accordance with this paragraph if the hearing is scheduled to begin less  than 20 days after the examiner's notice stating the time of the  hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Evidence--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The testimony of witnesses at a  hearing shall be upon oath or affirmation, subject to cross-examination,  and shall be reported verbatim.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any witness may, in the discretion of the examiner, be examined  separately and apart from all other witnesses except those who may be  parties to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The examiner shall exclude, insofar as practicable, evidence  which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not  of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Objections. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a party objects to the admission or rejection  of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or  cross-examination, the party shall state briefly the grounds of such  objections, whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the  objection is overruled by the examiner. The transcript or recording  shall not include argument or debate thereon except as ordered by the  examiner. The ruling of the examiner on any objection shall be a part of  the transcript or recording.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Only objections made before the examiner may subsequently be  relied upon in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Depositions. The deposition of any witness shall be admitted in  the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of Sec. 47.16.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Affidavits. Except as is otherwise provided in these rules,  affidavits may be admitted only if the evidence is otherwise admissible  and the parties agree (which may be determined by their failure to make  timely objections) that affidavits may be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Proof and authentication of official records or documents. An  official record or document, if admissible for any purpose, shall be  admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or  prepared the same. Such record or document shall be evidenced by an  official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the person having  legal authority to make such attestation. The person attesting the copy  shall make a certificate showing such authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Exhibits. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All written statements, charts, tabulations, or  similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after  identification by the proponent and upon a satisfactory showing of the  admissibility of the contents thereof, be numbered as exhibits, received  in evidence, and made a part of the record. Unless the examiner finds  that the furnishing of copies is impracticable, a copy of each exhibit  shall be filed with the examiner for the use of each other party to the  proceeding. The examiner shall advise the parties as to the exact number  of copies which will be required to be filed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the testimony of a witness refers to a statute, a report,  document, recording, or transcript, the examiner, after inquiry relating  to the identification of such statute, report, document, recording, or  transcript, shall determine whether the same shall be produced at the  hearing and physically be made a part of the evidence as an exhibit, or  whether it shall be incorporated into the evidence by reference. If  relevant and material matter offered in evidence is embraced in a  report, document, recording, or transcript containing immaterial or  irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter shall, insofar  as practicable, be designated by the party and segregated and excluded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record,  the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall  be included in the transcript or recording. The offer of proof shall  consist of a brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If  the evidence consists of a   brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be inserted into the  transcript or recording in toto. In such event, it shall be considered a  part of the transcript or recording if the Secretary decides that the  examiner's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The examiner  shall not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of  such evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing.  In the latter event, if the Secretary decides that the examiner erred in  excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, the hearing  shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Oral argument before examiner. The examiner may permit the  parties or their counsel to argue orally at the hearing or at some other  time prior to the transmittal of the record to the Secretary as provided  in this part. Such argument may be limited by the examiner to any extent  that the examiner finds necessary for the expeditious or proper  disposition of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Transcript or recording. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hearings to be conducted by  telephone shall be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device.  Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or the personal  attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the  hearing shall be transcribed, unless the examiner finds that recording  the hearing verbatim would expedite the proceeding and the examiner  orders the hearing to be recorded verbatim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the  transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the examiner  determines that the disposition of the proceeding would be expedited by  a transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the examiner shall  order the verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by the  party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a reporter transcribes or records the testimony at a hearing,  the reporter shall deliver the original transcript or recording, with  exhibits thereto attached, to the examiner, who will retain such copy  for the official file and for use in preparing his or her report. The  reporter will also deliver to the examiner such other copy or copies as  may be ordered by the Department, which copy or copies the examiner will  forward to the Hearing Clerk.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Parties to the proceeding, or others, who desire a copy of the  transcript or recording of the hearing may place orders at the hearing  with the reporter, who will furnish and deliver such copies direct to  the purchaser upon payment of the applicable rate.
