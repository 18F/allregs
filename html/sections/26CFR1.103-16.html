                                Sec. 1.103-16  Obligations of certain volunteer fire departments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. An obligation of a volunteer fire department issued after December 31, 1980, shall be treated as an obligation of a political subdivision of a State for purposes of section 103(a)(1) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The volunteer fire department is a qualified volunteer fire department within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Substantially all of the proceeds of the issue of which the obligation is a part are to be used for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or improvement of a fire house or fire truck used or to be used by the qualified volunteer fire department.
An obligation of a volunteer fire department shall not be treated as an obligation of a political subdivision of a State for purposes of section 103(a)(1) unless both conditions set forth in this paragraph (a) are satisfied.

Thus, for example, if an obligation is issued by an ambulance and rescue squad that is a qualified volunteer fire department as required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but substantially all of the proceeds of the issue of which the obligation is a part are to be used for the furnishing of emergency medical services, rather than for the purposes specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the obligation shall not be treated as an obligation of a political subdivision of a State for purposes of section 103(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of qualified volunteer fire department. For purposes of this section, the term ``qualified volunteer fire department'' means an organization--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> That is organized and operated to provide firefighting services or emergency medical services in an area within the jurisdiction of a political subdivision, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That is required to furnish firefighting services by written agreement with the political subdivision, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> That serves persons in an area within the jurisdiction of the political subdivision that is not provided with any other firefighting services.
The requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this section that a qualified volunteer fire department be required to furnish firefighting services by written agreement with the political subdivision may be satisfied by an ordinance or statute of the political subdivision that establishes, regulates, or funds the volunteer fire department. A volunteer fire department does not fail to satisfy the requirement of pargraph (b)(3) of this section by furnishing or receiving firefighting services on an emergency basis, or by cooperative agreement with other fire departments, to or from areas outside of the area that the volunteer fire department is organized and operated to serve. The fact that tax revenues of a political subdivision served by a volunteer fire department contribute toward the support of the volunteer fire department in the form of salary, purchase of equipment, or other defrayment of expenses will not prevent the volunteer fire department from being a ``qualified volunteer fire department'' within the meaning of this paragraph (b). Moreover, an obligation of a volunteer fire department receiving such support may qualify as an obligation of a political subdivision within the meaning of section 103(a)(1) independently of section 103(i) and this section if the requirements of section 103(a)(1) are satisfied. See Sec. 1.103-1(b) for rules relating to qualification under section 103(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> ``Substantially all'' test. Substantially all of the proceeds of an issue are used for the purposes specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section if 90 percent or more of the proceeds are so used. Thus, for example, if more than 10 percent of the proceeds of an obligation issued by a qualified volunteer fire department are used for the purchase of an ambulance or for rescue equipment not to be used in providing fire fighting services, interest on the obligation is not exempt from tax under section 103(i) and this section. In computing this percentage--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Costs are allocated between providing a firehouse or firetruck and other uses of the proceeds on a pro rata basis; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The rules set forth in Sec. 1.103-8(a)(1)(i), relating to amounts allocable to exempt and nonexempt uses and amounts chargeable to capital account, apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Refunding issues. An obligation which is part of an issue issued by a qualified volunteer fire department after December 31, 1980, part or all of the proceeds of which issue are used directly or indirectly to pay principal, interest, call premium, or reasonable incidental costs of refunding a prior issue qualifies as an obligation of a political subdivision under section 103(i) and this section only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The prior issue was issued by a qualified volunteer fire department;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Substantially all of the proceeds of the prior issue were used for the purposes described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The prior issue was issued after December 31, 1980; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The refunding issue is issued not more than 180 days before the date on which the last obligation of the prior issue is discharged (within the meaning of Sec. 1.103-13)(b)(11)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The County M Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association provides firefighting, ambulance, and emergency medical services

in County M. The board of county commissioners of County M contracts with the County M Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association for these services, and County M is not served by any other firefighting association. On August 1, 1981, the Association issues an obligation for funds to purchase a new fire truck, a new ambulance, and rescue equipment not to be used for fighting fires. Funds to be used for the purchase of the ambulance and rescue equipment constitute more than 10 percent of the proceeds of the obligation. Thus, substantially all of the proceeds of the obligations are not used for one of the purposes described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Although the County M Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association is a qualified volunteer fire department under paragraph (b) of this section because it provides firefighting and emergency medical services in an area within County M which is not provided with any other firefighting services and is required to provide these services by written agreement with County M, the August 1, 1981, obligation of County M Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association will not be treated as an obligation of a political subdivision of a State under section 103(i) and paragraph (a) of this section because substantially all of the proceeds of the obligation are not to be used for a purpose described in section 103(i)(l)(B) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Accordingly, interest on the August 1, 1981, obligation of County M Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association is not exempt from gross income under section 103(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. County N Volunteer Fire Department provides firefighting services in County N by contract with the county, which is not served by any other firefighting association. On June 15, 1982, County N Volunteer Fire Department issues its obligation for funds to construct an addition to its firehouse to house a rescue squad, the rescue squad's vehicle, and rescue equipment not to be used in firefighting. Although the County N Volunteer Fire Department is a qualified volunteer fire department under paragraph (b) of this section, interest on its June 15, 1982, obligation will not be exempt from tax under section 103(i) and this section because the proceeds of this obligation will not be used for the purposes described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The County O Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association provides firefighting, ambulance, and emergency medical services in County O. The board of county commissioners of County O contracts with the County O Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association for these services, and County O is not served by any other firefighting association. On September 1, 1983, the Association issues its obligations for funds to construct a new building to house its firefighting, ambulance, and rescue functions. Although the ambulance and rescue equipment will occupy space in the projected facility, the cost allocable on a pro rata basis to providing housing for the ambulance and rescue equipment represents less than 10 percent of the proceeds of the obligations. Thus, substantially all of the proceeds of the obligations are used for one of the purposes described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The County O Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association is a qualified volunteer fire department under paragraph (b) of this section because it provides firefighting and emergency medical services in an area within County O which is not provided with any other firefighting services and is required to provide these services by written agreement with County O. The obligations of County O Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association will be treated as obligations of a political subdivision of a State under section 103(i) and paragraph (a) of this section because the obligations are those of a qualified volunteer fire department and because substantially all of the proceeds of the obligations are to be used for a purpose described in section 103(i)(1)(B) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Accordingly, interest on the September 1, 1983, issue of obligations of County O Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association is exempt from gross income under section 103(a)(1).

Sec. 1.103(n)-1T  Limitation on aggregrate amount of private activity bonds (temporary).</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What does section 103(n) provide?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: Interest on an issue of private activity bonds will not be tax exempt unless the aggregrate amount of bonds issued pursuant to that issue, when added to (i) the aggregate amount of private activity bonds previously issued by the issuing authority during the calendar year and (ii) the portion of that year's private activity bond limit that the issuing authority has elected to carry forward to a future year, does not exceed the issuing authority's private activity bond limit for that calendar year. See A-4 of Sec. 1.103(n)-4T with respect to private activity bonds issued under a carryforward election.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: What is the effective date of section 103(n)?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: In general, section 103(n) applies to private activity bonds issued after December 31, 1983. Section 103(n) does not apply to any issue of obligations, however, if there was an inducement

resolution (or other comparable preliminary approval) for the project before June 19, 1984, and the issue for such project is issued before January 1, 1985. An issue of obligations will be considered to be issued for the project pursuant to the inducement resolution in existence before June 19, 1984, to the extent that the nature, character, and purpose of the facility has not changed in any material way, and to the extent that the capacity of the facility has not increased materially; in addition, the issue of obligations must be for the same or a related initial owner, manager, or operator. See Sec. 1.103-10(e) for the definition of related persons. See A-16 of Sec. 1.103(n)-3T with respect to certain projects preliminarily approved before October 19, 1983. The transitional rules provided by section 631(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 do not apply to section 103(n). See Sec. 1.103-13(b)(6) for the rules relating to the date of issue of obligations.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: If an issue of private activity bonds causes the issuer's private activity bond limit to be exceeded, what is the effect on that issue?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: If an issue of private activity bonds causes the issuing authority's private activity bond limit to be exceeded, no portion of that issue will be treated as obligations described in section 103(a), and interest paid on the issue will be subject to Federal income taxation.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: If an issue of private activity bonds causes the issuer's private activity bond limit to be exceeded, what is the effect on previous issues of private activity bonds that met the requirements of section 103(n) when issued?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: Private activity bonds issued as part of an issue that met the private activity bond limit when issued continue to meet the requirements of section 103(n) even though a subsequent issue causes the aggregate amount of private activity bonds issued by an issuing authority to exceed the authority's private activity bond limit for the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of A-3 and A-4 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-1T:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The State ceiling for State Z for 1986 is $200 million. City M, within the State, and State Z itself are authorized to issue private activity bonds. Under the allocation formula provided by the Governor of State Z, City M has a private activity bond limit of $50 million; the balance of the State ceiling is allocated to State Z. On June 1, 1986, City M issues a $75 activity bonds. On September 1, 1986, State Z issues a $150 million issue of private activity bonds. Based on these facts, the obligations of City M do not meet the requirements of section 103(n) since the aggregate amount of private activity bonds issued by City M in 1986 exceeded its private activity bond limit for such year; thus, such obligations are not described in section 103(a). That the State Z issue caused the aggregate amount of private activity bonds issued in the State during 1986 to exceed the State ceiling does not cause such obligations to fail to meet the requirements of section 103(n).</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: What is the aggregate amount of private activity bonds issued as part of an issue?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: The aggregate amount of private activity bonds issued as part of an issue is the face amount of the issue.

Sec. 1.103(n)-2T  Private activity bond defined (temporary).</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What is the definition of the term ``private activity bond''?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: In general, for purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.103(n)-1T through 1.103(n)-6T, the term ``private activity bond'' means any industrial development bond or student loan bond the interest on which is exempt from tax under section 103(a) (without application of section 103(n)). See Sec. 1.103-7(b) for the definition of the term ``industrial development bond.'' See A-17 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-2T for the definition of the term ``student loan bond.'' There are five exceptions to the general definition of the term ``private activity bond''; the exceptions include the exception for the Texas Veterans' Bond Program, the residential rental property exception, the exception for certain facilities described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D), and the refunding obligation exception. These exceptions are described in A-2 through A-16 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-2T. In addition, the term ``private activity bond'' does not include any issue of obligations if there was an inducement resolution (or

other comparable preliminary approval) for the project before June 19, 1984, and the issue for that project is issued before January 1, 1985. See A-2 of Sec. 1.103(n)-1T.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: To which obligations does the exception for the Texas Veterans' Bond Program apply?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: The term ``private activity bond'' does not include general obligation bonds issued under the Texas Veterans' Bond Program if the proceeds of the issue, other than an amount that is not a major portion of the proceeds, are used to make loans of up to $20,000 for the purchase of land for purposes authorized by such program as in effect on June 19, 1984. The use of the proceeds may be established by the affidavit of the veteran receiving the loan. For purposes of this exception to the definition of the term ``private activity bond,'' the use of more than 25 percent of the proceeds of an issue of obligations will constitute the use of a major portion of such proceeds.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: To which obligations does the residential rental property exception apply?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: The term ``private activity bond'' does not include any obligation issued to provide projects for residential rental property (including property functionally related and subordinate to any such facility), as described in section 103(b)(4)(A) and Sec. 1.103-8(b). In addition, the term ``private activity bond'' does not include any housing program obligation under section 11(b) of the United States Housing Act of 1937.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: To which obligations does the exception for certain facilities described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D) apply?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: Section 103(n)(7)(C) provides that the term ``private activity bond'' does not include any obligation issued as part of an issue to provide convention or trade show facilities, as described in section 103(b)(4)(C) and Sec. 1.103-8(d) (including property functionally related and subordinate to any such facilities), if the property so described is owned by, or on behalf of, a governmental unit. In addition, the term ``private activity bond'' does not include any obligation issued as part of an issue to provide airports, docks, wharfs, mass commuting facilities, or storage or training facilities directly related to any of the foregoing facilities, as described in section 103(b)(4)(D) and Sec. 1.103-8(e) (including property functionally related and subordinate to any such facilities), if the property so described is owned by, or on behalf of, a governmental unit. See Sec. 1.103-8(a)(3), in general, for the definition of the term ``functionally related and subordinate.'' For purposes of this exception to the definition of the term ``private activity bond,'' the term ``mass commuting facilities'' includes ``qualified mass commuting vehicles,'' as defined in section 103(b)(9), that are associated with a mass commuting facility described in Sec. 1.103-8(e)(2)(iv). Obligations issued as part of an issue to provide parking facilities, as described in section 103(b)(4)(D), are not excepted from the definition of the term ``private activity bond;'' however, parking facilities may be functionally related and subordinate to another facility described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D).</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: When is property described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D) owned by, or on behalf of, a governmental unit?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: In general, property described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D) will be considered to be owned by a governmental unit if a governmental unit is the owner of the property for Federal income tax purposes generally. See A-5 of Sec. 1.103(n)-3T for the definition of the term ``governmental unit''. In general, property described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D) will be considered to be owned on behalf of a governmental unit if a constituted authority empowered to issue obligations on behalf of a governmental unit is the owner of the property for Federal income tax purposes generally. Whether the property is owned by, or on behalf of, a governmental unit will be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each particular case. The fact that the governmental unit's or constituted authority's obligation to pay principal and interest on an obligation is limited to revenues from fees collected from users of the property provided with the proceeds of such obligation will not, in itself, cause such property to be treated as not owned by, or on behalf of, the governmental unit. In order to qualify for the exception described in section

103(n)(7)(C), the property must be owned by, or on behalf of, the governmental unit throughout the term of the issue. See A-10 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-2T with respect to the consequences of a transfer of ownership.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: Will property described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D) that is leased to a non-governmental entity be treated as owned by, or on behalf of, a governmental unit if the lessee is the owner of the property for Federal income tax purposes generally solely by reason of the length of the lease?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: If property, or any portion thereof, is leased to a non-governmental entity and if, for Federal income tax purposes generally, the lessee is the owner of the property solely by reason of the length of the lease, then, for purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.103(n)-1T through 1.103(n)-6T (but not for other Federal income tax purposes, such as whether payments under the lease constitute deductible rental payments), the governmental unit will be treated as the owner of the property if the lessee elects not to claim depreciation or an investment credit with respect to such property. See A-7 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-2T for the rules describing the method of making this election. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.103(n)-1T through 1.103(n)-6T, the term ``non-governmental entity'' means a person other than a governmental unit or a constituted authority empowered to issue obligations on behalf of a governmental unit. The fact that a non-governmental entity lessee elects not to claim depreciation or an investment credit with respect to property does not, however, ensure that the property will be treated as owned by, or on behalf of a governmental unit for purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.103(n)-1T through 1.103(n)-6T. Thus, for example, if the lessee is the owner of the property for Federal income tax purposes generally other than solely because of the length of the lease, the obligations issued as part of the issue are private activity bonds notwithstanding that the lessee elected not to claim depreciation or an investment credit with respect to the property.</p><p class="depth0">Similarly, even if a governmental unit is the owner of property for Federal income tax purposes generally, the property will not be treated as owned by, or on behalf of, a governmental unit for purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.103(n)-1T through 1.103(n)-6T if the lease under which such property is leased to a non-governmental entity provides for significant front end loading of rental accruals or payments. See A-12 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-2T with respect to significant front end loading of rental accruals or payments.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: What must a lessee do in order to elect not to take depreciation or an investment credit with respect to property described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D)?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: The lessee must make the election at the time the lease is executed. The election must include a description of the property with respect to which the election is being made; the name, address, and TIN of the issuing authority; the name, address, and TIN of the lessee; and the date and face amount of the issue the proceeds of which are to be used to provide the property. The election must be signed by the lessee, if a natural person, or by a duly authorized official of the lessee. The issuing authority must be provided with a copy of the election. The issuing authority and the lessee must retain copies of the election in their respective records for the entire term of the lease. In addition, the lease, and any publicly recorded document recorded in lieu of such lease, must state that neither the lessee nor any successor in interest under the lease may claim depreciation or an investment credit with respect to such property. This election may be made with respect to property whether or not such property otherwise would be eligible for depreciation or an investment tax credit. See section 7701(a)(41) for the definition of the term ``TIN''.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8: Is the election not to claim depreciation or an investment credit revocable?</p><p class="depth0">A-8: No, the election is irrevocable. In addition, the election is binding on all successors in interest under the lease regardless of whether the obligations remain outstanding. If a successor in interest claims depreciation or an investment credit with respect to property for which such an election has

been made, such property will be considered transferred to a non-governmental entity. See A-10 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-2T with respect to the consequences of such a transfer.</p><p class="depth0">Q-9: Where obligations are issued to provide all or any portion of a facility described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D), must all of the property described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D) that is part of such facility be owned by, or on behalf of, a governmental unit in order for such obligations to qualify for the exception to the definition of the term ``private activity bond'' provided in section 103(n)(7)(C)?</p><p class="depth0">A-9: Generally, yes. If obligations are issued to provide all or any portion of a facility described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D), the obligations comprising such issue will not qualify for the exception to the definition of the term ``private activity bond'' provided in section 103(n)(7)(C) unless all of the property described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D) that is part of (or functionally related and subordinate to) the facility being financed is owned by, or on behalf of, a governmental unit throughout the term of the issue. For this purpose, the facility being financed will be construed to include the entire airport, dock, etc., under consideration and not merely the part of the facility being provided with the proceeds of the issue. For example, the term facility, when used in reference to an airport, will be considered to include all property that is part of, or included in, that airport under Sec. 1.103-8(e)(2)(ii)(a), including all property functionally related and subordinate thereto under Sec. 1.103-8 (a)(3) and (e)(2)(ii)(b). Thus, if the proceeds of an issue are used to provide a hangar at an airport described in section 103(b)(4)(D), that airport is considered as being financed with such issue, and if any portion of that airport, including property functionally related and subordinate thereto, is treated as owned by a non-governmental entity, that issue does not qualify for the exception of the definition of the term ``private activity bond'' provided in section 103(n)(7)(C).</p><p class="depth0">There are three exceptions to this rule, however. First, if any property otherwise would be considered part of the facility financed and such property was not provided with proceeds of any obligation described in section 103(a), such property will not be considered part of the facility being financed.</p><p class="depth0">Second, if any property otherwise would be considered part of the facility being financed and such property was part of such facility on or before October 5, 1984, such property will not be considered part of the facility being financed. For this purpose, property will be considered part of the facility on or before October 5, 1984, if any person was under a binding contract to acquire or construct such property to be a part of such facility on October 5, 1984.</p><p class="depth0">Third, property will not be considered part of the facility being financed if such property (i) is land, a building, a structural component of a building, or other structure (other than tangible personal property (other than an air conditioning or heating unit)) and such property is not physically supported by, does not physically support, and is not physically connected to any property provided with the proceeds of obligations that qualify for the exception to the definition of the term ``private activity bond'' provided in section 103(n)(7)(C), or (ii) is tangible personal property (other than an air conditioning or heating unit). For this purpose, contiguous parcels of land will not be considered to support, to be supported by, or to be physically connected to each other, and insignificant physical connections (such as a connection by a sidewalk) will be disregarded. For purposes of this A-9, the term ``tangible personal property'' shall have the meaning given to it under section 48(a)(1)(A) and Sec. 1.48-1(c). Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of A-9 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-2T:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On January 1, 1986, Governmental Unit M issues industrial development bonds to provide an airport, as described in section 103(b)(4)(D), which will consist of land, runways, a terminal and a functionally related and subordinate hotel. The hotel will be leased to N, a non-governmental entity. The lease does not call for significant front end loading of rental accruals or payments. For Federal income tax purposes generally, M will own the entire airport except that N

will be the owner of the hotel solely by reason of the length of the lease. N properly elects not to claim depreciation of an investment credit with respect to the hotel. The industrial development bonds are not private activity bonds.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that N does not make the election and claims depreciation with respect to the hotel. The entire issue of industrial development bonds is treated as an issue of private activity bonds.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example (2) except that the hotel is provided other than with the proceeds of an obligation described in section 103(a). The issue for the remainder of the airport qualifies for the exception to the definition of the term ``private activity bond'' provided in section 103(n)(7)(C).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example (2) except that the hotel, including the hotel parking lot, the hotel grounds, and the parcel of land on which they rest, are provided with a separate issue of industrial development bonds. There are no significant connections between the hotel and the airport. The issue for the hotel is an issue of private activity bonds. The issue for the remainder of the airport qualifies for the exception to the definition of the term ``private activity bonds'' provided in section 103(n)(7)(C).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as Example (4) except that the hotel is constructed upon land provided with the proceeds of the issue used to provide the remainder of the airport. Both issues are treated as issues of private activity bonds.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. On June 30, 1983, construction began on the City NN airport, which consists of land, runways, a terminal, and hangars. Corporation XX (a non-governmental entity) owns for Federal income tax purposes generally several of the hangars, which it financed with obligations described in section 103(a) issued on June 30, 1983. On March 1, 1985, at a time when XX still owns the hangars, City NN issues an issue of obligations described in section 103(b)(4)(D) to enlarge the terminal at the City NN airport. City NN will own the addition to the terminal for Federal income tax purposes generally. The obligations comprising the March 1, 1985, issue will not be private activity bonds.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10: What are the consequences if a governmental unit ceases to be treated as owning property described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D) where the property was provided by obligations that were not private activity bonds on the date of issue due to the exception provided in section 103(n)(7)(C)?</p><p class="depth0">A-10: The obligations outstanding on the date such ownership ceases are private activity bonds and are treated as if they are the last private activity bonds issued by the issuer in the calendar year in which the transfer of ownership occurs. Thus, if the aggregate amount of bonds issued pursuant to such issue, when added to the aggregate amount of the other private activity bonds actually issued or treated as issued under this A-10 by the issuer during such year and the amount of any carryforward elections made during the year, exceeds the issuer's private activity bond limit for such year, the obligations are not described in section 103(a) as of the date on which transfer of ownership occurs; if such obligations do not comply with the requirements of section 103(n), the obligations will be treated as not described in section 103(a) as of the date such ownership ceases. However, if on the date of issue the issuer intended to transfer ownership of such property to a non-governmental entity during the term of the issue, then the obligations are treated as the last private activity bonds actually issued or treated as issued under this A-10 by the issuer during the year in which such obligations were actually issued; if such obligations do not comply with the requirements of section 103(n), the obligations will be treated as not described in section 103(a) as of the date of issue. The exception to the definition of the term ``private activity bond'' for facilities described in section 103(b)(4) (C) and (D) only applies if the property is owned by, or on behalf of, a governmental unit while all or any part of the issue or any refunding issue remains outstanding.</p><p class="depth0">If all or a portion of the property is sold to a non-governmental entity for its fair market value and all of the proceeds from the sale (except for a de minimis amount less than $5,000) are used within six months to redeem outstanding obligations, the obligations will not be treated as private entity bonds.</p><p class="depth0">Q-11: What are the consequences if private activity bonds are issued to provide additions to a facility that was provided with obligations that were not private activity bonds when issued by virtue of the exception provided in section 103(n)(7)(C) and such additions

are not treated as owned by a governmental unit?</p><p class="depth0">A-11: In order to qualify for the exception to the definition of the term ``private activity bond'' for obligations described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D), all of the property described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D) that is part of the facility provided with the proceeds generally must be owned by, or on behalf of, a governmental unit. See A-9 of this Sec. 1.103 (n)-2T. However, if the proceeds of an issue of private activity bonds are used to make additions to a facility (other than additions that are not considered to be part of the facility under A-9 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-2T) that was provided with another issue of industrial development bonds that were not private activity bonds when issued by virtue of the exception provided in section 103(n)(7)(C), then the prior issue will not cease to qualify for that exception. Nevertheless, for purposes of determining the aggregate amount of private activity bonds issued during the year that the issue to provide the addition to the previously financed facility is issued, the portion of the prior issue outstanding on the date of issue of the issue to provide the addition will be treated as part of the issue to provide the addition.</p><p class="depth0">Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of A-11 of this Sec. 1.103 (n)-2T:</p><p class="depth0">Example. On March 1, 1986, City P issues a $100 million issue of industrial development bonds to provide an airport, as described in section 103(b)(4)(D). City P uses substantially all of the proceeds to acquire land and to construct runways and a terminal on that land. No other property is constructed on the land. City P is the owner of the land and the terminal for Federal income tax purposes generally. Thus, the obligations comprising the March 1, 1986, issue are not private activity bonds when issued. On September 1, 1988, City P leases a portion of the land adjacent to the terminal to Corporation V (a non-governmental entity) under a true lease for Federal income tax purposes. City P's private activity bond limit for 1988 is $100 million, and as of September 30, 1988, City P has not issued any private activity bond during 1988. On September 30, 1988, City P issues a $20 million issue of industrial development bonds, the proceeds of which are to be used to construct a hotel that is functionally related and subordinate to the airport. The hotel is to be constructed on the land that P leased to Corporation V. The hotel will be owned by Corporation V for Federal income tax purposes generally. On September 30, 1988, the outstanding face amount of the March 1, 1986, issue is $100 million. Although the obligations comprising the March 1, 1986, issue will not become private activity bonds as a result of the subsequent issue, on September 30, 1988, City P is treated as issuing a $120 million issue of private activity bonds. Since that amount exceeds City P's private activity bond limit, the $20 million issue of private activity bonds issued on September 30, 1988, does not meet the requirements of section 103(n). In addition, any subsequent issuance of private activity bonds by City P during 1988 will fail to meet the requirements of section 103(n). The March 1, 1986, issue continues to be described in section 103(a).</p><p class="depth0">Q-12: Section 103(n)(7)(C)(iv) provides that the exception for certain facilities described in section 103(b)(4) (C) or (D) shall not apply in any case where the facility is leased under a lease that has significant front end loading of rental accruals or payments. What does ``significant front end loading of rental accruals or payments'' mean?</p><p class="depth0">A-12: Where a lease requires rental payments that are significantly higher in the early years of the lease than in later years, the lease calls for significant front end loading of rental accruals or payments. A lease that provides for flat rental payments during the entire lease term does not violate the prohibition against significant front end loading of rent. In addition, a lease may provide for adjustments in rent for inflation or deflation, provided that such adjustments are to be made on the basis of a generally recognized price index. In addition, a lease may provide that rental payments are to be determined, in whole or part, based on a percentage of income, production, etc., provided that the percentage rate is kept constant (or increases) over the term of the lease and that the threshold, if any, above which the percentage applies is kept constant (or decreases) over the term of the lease. Thus, for example, a lease that requires rental payments throughout the term of the lease of $100,000 per year plus 5 percent of the gross income from the facility in excess of $500,000 does not violate the prohibition against significant front end loading of rent.</p><p class="depth0">Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of A-4 through A-12 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-2T:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On February 1, 1985, County Z issues obligations with a term of 30 years. Substantially all of the proceeds of the obligations are to be used to provide a trade show facility as described in section 103(b)(4)(C). Z leases the entire facility to Corporation S. For Federal income tax purposes generally, S is treated as the owner of the facility solely by reason of the length of the lease. The lease provides that the lessee will elect not to claim depreciation or an investment credit with respect to the facility and that S will provide Z with a copy of the election. S makes the election, retains it in its records, and provides County Z with a copy. The lease provides that neither the lessee nor any successor in interest will claim a deduction for depreciation or an investment credit with respect to such facility. The obligations are not private activity bonds on the date of issue, provided that the lease does not call for significant front end loading of rental accruals or payments.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that on February 1, 1986, S assigns the lease to Corporation T. For its taxable year ending March 31, 1986, Corporation T claims depreciation with respect to the trade show facility. The obligations outstanding on the date Corporation T claims depreciation on its Federal income tax return are treated as the last private activity bonds actually issued or treated as issued by County Z during 1986, and such obligations must comply with the requirements of section 103(n). In addition, Corporation T is not entitled to claim depreciation or an investment credit with respect to the trade show facility during the balance of the term of the lease and will be subject to the applicable penalties for so claiming depreciation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that the obligations are redeemed on January 31, 1998; on January 31, 1999, S assigns the lease to Corporation X; and on its Federal income tax return for calendar year 1999, Corporation X claims depreciation with respect to the facility. The obligations are not private activity bonds provided that the lease does not call for significant front end loading of rental accruals or payments. However, X is not entitled to claim depreciation or an investment credit with respect to the trade show facility during the balance of the term of the lease and will be subject to the applicable penalties for so claiming those items.</p><p class="depth0">Q-13: To which obligations does the refunding obligation exception apply?</p><p class="depth0">A-13: The term ``private activity bond'' does not include any refunding obligation to the extent specified in this A-13. The term ``refunding obligation'' means an obligation that is part of an issue of obligations the proceeds of which are used to pay any principal or interest on any other issue of obligations described in section 103(a) (referred to as the prior issue). The term ``refunding obligation'' does not include any obligations issued more than 180 days before the prior issue is discharged (``advance refundings''). The exception for refunding obligations only applies to the extent that the aggregate amount of the refunding issue does not exceed the outstanding face amount of the prior issue, or portion thereof, being refunded. Thus, for example, in the case of an obligation part of the proceeds of which are to be used to refund a prior issue of private activity bonds and part of the proceeds of which are to be used to provide a pollution control facility under section 103(b)(4)(F), those proceeds to be used to refund all or any part of the principal amount of the prior issue are not the proceeds of a private activity bond; the balance of the proceeds are the proceeds of a private activity bond. The refunding obligation exception does not apply to obligations to the extent that amounts are used to pay the costs of issuing refunding obligations. If an issue of obligations consists of both obligations that qualify for the refunding obligation exception and private activity bonds that do not meet the requirements of section 103(n), the entire issue is treated as consisting of obligations not described in section 103(a).</p><p class="depth0">Q-14: Does the refunding obligation exception apply to obligations issued to refund a prior issue of student loan bonds?</p><p class="depth0">A-14: In the case of any student loan bond, the refunding obligation exception applies only if, in addition to the requirements stated in A-13 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-2T, the maturity date of the funding obligation is not later than the later of (i) the maturity date of the obligation to be refunded, or (ii) the date 17 years after the date on which the refunded obligation was issued (or, in the case of a series of refundings, the date on which the original obligation was issued).</p><p class="depth0">Q-15: What is the ``maturity date'' of an obligation?</p><p class="depth0">A-15: For purposes of section 103(n), the ``maturity date'' of an obligation is the date on which interest ceases to accrue and the obligation may either be paid or redeemed without penalty. The date is determined without regard to optional redemption dates (including those at the option of holders). If the issuer is required by the obligations or the indenture to redeem portions of obligations or to make payments of principal with respect to obligations in specified amounts and at specified times, such mandatory redemptions or payments shall be treated as separate obligations.</p><p class="depth0">Q-16: Where private activity bonds are refunded with other obligations described in section 103(a), does the refunding obligation exception apply to the extent that the aggregate amount of the refunding obligations exceeds the outstanding principal amount of the prior issue due to the use of a portion of the proceeds of the refunding issue to fund a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund?</p><p class="depth0">A-16: Whether the prior issue was issued prior to January 1, 1984, or thereafter, the refunding obligation exception to the definition of the term ``private activity bond'' only applies to the extent that the aggregate amount of the refunding obligation does not exceed the outstanding principal amount of the prior issue. Thus, the additional obligations issued to provide for a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund are private activity bonds.</p><p class="depth0">Q-17: What is a ``student loan bond''?</p><p class="depth0">A-17: The term ``student loan bond'' means an obligation that is issued as part of an issue all or a major portion of the proceeds of which are to be used directly or indirectly to finance loans to individuals for educational expenses. For purposes of this A-17, the use of more than 25 percent of the proceeds of an issue of obligations to finance loans to individuals for educational expenses will constitute the use of a major portion of such proceeds in such manner.

Sec. 1.103(n)-3T  Private activity bond limit (temporary).</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What is the ``State ceiling''?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: In general, the State ceiling applicable to each State and the District of Columbia for any calendar year prior to 1987 shall be the greater of $200 million or an amount equal to $150 multiplied by the State's (or the District of Columbia's) population. In the case of any territory or possession of the United States, the State ceiling for any calendar year prior to 1987 shall be an amount equal to $150 multiplied by the population of such territory or possession. In the case of calendar years after 1986, the two preceding sentences shall be applied by substituting ``$100'' for ``$150.'' In the case of any State that had an excess bond amount for 1983, the State ceiling for calendar year 1984 shall be the sum of the State ceiling determined under the general rule plus 50 percent of the excess bond amount for 1983. The excess bond amount for 1983 is the excess (if any) of (i) the aggregate amount of private activity bonds issued by issuing authorities in such State during the first 9 months of calendar year 1983 multiplied by \4/3\, over (ii) the State ceiling determined under the general rule for 1984. For purposes of determining the State ceiling amount applicable to any any State for calendar year 1984, an issuer may rely upon the State ceiling amount published by the Treasury Department for such calendar year. However, an issuer may compute a different excess bond amount for 1983 where the issuer or the State in which the issuer is located has made a more accurate determination of the amount of private activity bonds issued by issuing authorities in the issuer's State during 1983. See A-7 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T for rules regarding a State containing constitutional home rule cities.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: What is the private activity bond limit for a State agency?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: Under section 103(n)(2) the private activity bond limit for any agency of the State authorized to issue private activity bonds for any calendar year shall be 50 percent of the State ceiling for such year unless the State provides for a different allocation. For this purpose, the State is considered an agency. See, however, A-17 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-

3T with respect to the penalty for failure to comply with the requirements of section 631(a)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: How is private activity bond limit determined where a State has more than one agency?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: If any State has more than one agency (including the State) authorized to issue private activity bonds, all such agencies shall be treated as a single agency for purposes of determining the aggregate private activity bond limit available for all such agencies. Each of the State agencies is treated as having jurisdiction over the entire State. Therefore, under A-8 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T the aggregate private activity bond limit for all the State agencies is allocated to the State since it possesses the broadest sovereign powers of any of the State agencies. Each other State agency's private activity bond limit is zero until it is assigned part of the private activity bond limit of another governmental unit pursuant to these regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: What is a State agency?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: A State agency is an agency authorized by a State to issue private activity bonds on behalf of the State. In addition, a special purpose governmental unit that derives its sovereign powers from the State and may exercise its sovereign powers throughout the State is a State agency. See A-5 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T for the definition of the term ``special purpose governmental unit.'' The term ``State agency'' does not include issuing authorities empowered by a State at the request of another governmental unit within the State to issue private activity bonds to provide facilities within the jurisdiction of such other governmental unit. For example, if County O requests the legislature of State P to create an issuing authority empowered to issue obligations to provide pollution control facilities in County O, the authority is not a State agency.</p><p class="depth0">Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of A-3 and A-4 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. For 1987 State Q has a State ceiling of $200 million. Neither the Governor nor the legislature of State Q has provided a formula for allocating the State ceiling different from that provided by section 103(n) (2) and (3). State Q has authorized the following State agencies to issue private activity bonds on its behalf: Authority M, Authority N, and Authority O. The aggregate private activity bond limit available for State agencies of State Q is $100 million. As of January 1, 1987, none of this aggregate private activity bond limit has been assigned to any of Authorities M, N, or O. On January 1, 1987, Authority M issues $25 million of private activity bonds. During 1987, the duly authorized official designated by State Q to allocate the aggregate private activity bond limit among the three authorities does not allocate any of the State's private activity bond limit to Authority M. The January 1, 1987, issue does not meet the requirements of section 103(n) since Authority M has no private activity bond limit for 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Under the laws of State U, only the State legislature can create constituted authorities empowered to issue private activity bonds on behalf of governmental units within State U. Authority R was created by the State U legislature at the request of County X. Authority R is a constituted authority empowered to issue private activity bonds on behalf of County X to provide facilities located in County X. Authority S was created by the legislature to issue private activity bonds to provide pollution control facilities throughout the State. Authority S is a State agency as defined in A-4 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T. Authority R it is not a State agency.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: What is a governmental unit?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: The term ``governmental unit'' has the meaning given such term by Sec. 1.103-1. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.103(n)-1T through 1.103(n)-6T, a governmental unit is either a general purpose governmental unit or a special purpose governmental unit. The term ``general purpose governmental unit'' means a State, territory, possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any general purpose political subdivision thereof. The term ``general purpose political subdivision'' denotes any division of government that possesses the right to exercise police powers, the power to tax, and the power of eminent domain and that is governed, at least in part, by popularly elected officials (e.g., county, city, town, township, parish, village). The term ``special purpose governmental unit'' means any governmental unit as defined in Sec. 1.103-1 other than a general purpose governmental unit. For example, a sewer authority with the power of eminent domain but without police powers is a special purpose governmental unit.

A constituted authority empowered to issue private activity bonds on behalf of a governmental unit is not a governmental unit.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: What is the private activity bond limit for a general purpose governmental unit other than a State, the District of Columbia, a territory, or a possession?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: The private activity bond limit for any such general purpose governmental unit for any calendar year is an amount equal to the general purpose governmental unit's proportionate share of 50 percent of the State ceiling amount for such calendar year. See A-10 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T with respect to the rules for providing a different allocation. The proportionate share of a general purpose governmental unit is an amount that bears the same ratio to 50 percent of the State ceiling for such year as the population of the jurisdiction of such general purpose governmental unit bears to the population of the entire State, District of Columbia, territory, or possession in which its jurisdiction falls. See, however, A-17 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T with respect to the penalty for failure to comply with the requirements of section 631(a)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984. See A-9 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T with respect to the private activity bond limit of issuing authorities other than general purpose governmental units.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: What is the private activity bond limit for a general purpose governmental unit in a State with one or more constitutional homes rule cities?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: The private activity bond limit for a constitutional home rule city for any calendar year is an amount equal to the constitutional home rule city's proportionate share of 100 percent of the State ceiling amount for the calendar year. The proportionate share of a constitutional home rule city is an amount that bears the same ratio to the State ceiling for such year as the population of the jurisdiction of such constitutional home rule city bears to the population of the entire State. The private activity bond limit for issuers other than constitutional home rule cities is computed in the manner described in A-2 through A-6 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T, except that in computing the private activity bond limit for issuers other than such constitutional home rule cities, the State ceiling amount for any calendar year shall be reduced by the aggregate private activity bond limit for all constitutional home rule cities in the State. The term ``constitutional home rule city'' means, with respect to any calendar year, any political subdivision of a State that, under a State constitution that was adopted in 1970 and effective on July 1, 1971, had home rule powers on the first day of the calendar year. See, however, A-17 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T with respect to the penalty for failure to comply with the requirements of section 631(a)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8: How is the private activity bond limit of an issuing authority determined under section 103(n)(3) when there are overlapping jurisdictions?</p><p class="depth0">A-8: If an area is within the jurisdiction of two or more governmental units, that area will be treated as only within the jurisdiction of the governmental unit having jurisdiction over the smallest geographical area. However, the governmental unit with jurisdiction over the smallest geographical area may enter into a written agreement to allocate all or a designated portion of such overlapping area to the governmental unit having jurisdiction over the next smallest geographical area. Where two or more issuing authorities, whether governmental units or constituted authorities, have authority to issue private activity bonds and both issuing authorities have jurisdiction over the identical geographical area, that area will be treated as only within the jurisdiction of the one having the broadest sovereign powers. However, the issuing authority having the broadest sovereign powers may enter into a written agreement to allocate all or a designated portion of such area to the one with the narrower sovereign powers. All written agreements entered into pursuant to this A-8 must be retained by the assignee in its records for the term of all private activity bonds it issues in each calendar year to which such agreement applies. See A-9 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T with respect to the private activity bond limit of issuing authorities other than general purpose governmental units.</p><p class="depth0">Q-9: What is the private activity bond limit of an issuing authority (other than a State agency) that is not a general purpose governmental unit?</p><p class="depth0">A-9: A constituted authority empowered to issue private activity bonds on behalf of a governmental unit is treated as having jurisdiction over the same geographical area as the governmental unit on behalf of which it is empowered to issue private activity bonds. Since a governmental unit has broader sovereign powers than a constituted authority empowered to issue private activity bonds on its behalf, a constituted authority has a private activity bond limit under section 103(n) (2) and (3) of zero. Similarly, a special purpose governmental unit is treated for purposes of section 103(n) as having jurisdiction over the same geographical area as that of the general purpose governmental unit or units from which the special purpose governmental unit derives its sovereign powers. Since a general purpose governmental unit has broader sovereign powers than a special purpose governmental unit, a special purpose governmental unit has a private activity bond limit under section 103(n) (2) and (3) of zero. An issuer of qualified scholarship funding bonds, as defined in section 103(e), is treated for purposes of section 103(n) as issuing on behalf of the State or politicial subdivision or subdivisions that requested its organization or its exercise of power to issue bonds. See A-13 and A-14 of this Sec. 103(n)-3T with respect to assignments of private activity bond limit. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.103(n)-1T through 1.103(n)-6T, a special purpose governmental unit shall be considered to derive its authority from the smallest general purpose governmental unit that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Enacts a specific law (e.g., a provision of a State constitution, charter, or statute) by or under which the special purpose governmental unit is created, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Otherwise empowers, approves, or requests the creation of the special purpose governmental unit, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Appoints members to the governing body of the special purpose governmental unit,
and within which general purpose governmental unit falls the entire area in which such special purpose governmental unit may exercise its sovereign powers. If no one general purpose governmental unit meets such criteria (e.g., a regional special purpose governmental unit that exercises its sovereign powers within three counties pursuant to a separate ordinance adopted by each such county), such special purpose governmental unit shall be considered to derive its sovereign powers from each of the general purpose governmental units comprising the combination of smallest general purpose governmental units within which falls the entire area in which such special purpose governmental unit may exercise its sovereign powers and each of which meets (i), (ii), or (iii) above.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10: Does the issue comply with the requirements of section 103 (n) under the following circumstances? Based on the most recent estimate of the resident population of State Y published by the Bureau of the Census before the beginning of 1988, the State ceiling for State Y is $200 million. Based on the same estimate, the population of City Q is one-fourth of the population of State Y. No part of the geographical area within the jurisidiction of City Q is within the jurisdiction of any other governmental unit with jurisdiction over a smaller geographical area. There are no consitutional home rule cities in State Y. Neither the Governor nor the legislature of State Y has provided a different formula for allocating the State ceiling than that provided by section 103(n) (2) and (3); thus, City Q's private activity bond limit for 1988 is $25 million (.25 x .50 x $200 million). As of March 1, 1988, City Q has issued $15 million of private activity bonds during calendar year 1988, none of which were issued pursuant to a carryforward election made in a prior year.

The governor of a State may proclaim a different formula for allocating the State ceiling among the governmental units in such State having authority to issue private activity bonds. The authority of the governor to proclaim a different formula shall not apply after the earlier of (i) the first day of the first calendar year beginning after the legislature of the State has met in regular session for more than 60 days after July 18, 1984, and (ii) the effective date of any State legislation dealing with the allocation of the State ceiling. If, on or before either date, the governor of any State exercises the authority to provide a different allocation, such allocation shall be effective until the date specified in (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence. Unless otherwise provided in a State constitutional amendment or by a law changing the home rule provisions adopted in the manner provided by the State constitution, the allocation of that portion of the State ceiling that is allocated to any constitutional home rule city may not be changed by the governor or State legislature unless such city agrees to such different allocation.</p><p class="depth0">Q-12: Where a State provides an allocation formula different from that provided in section 103 (n) (2) and (3), which allocation formula applies to obligations issued prior to the adoption of the different allocation formula?</p><p class="depth0">A-12: Where a State provides a different allocation formula, the determination as to whether a particular bond issue meets the requirements of section 103(n) will be based upon the allocation formula in effect at the time such bonds were issued. The amount that may be reallocated pursuant to the later allocation formula is limited to the State ceiling for such year reduced by the amount of private activity bonds issued under the prior allocation formula in effect for such year.</p><p class="depth0">Q-13: May an issuing authority assign a portion of its private activity bond limit to another issuing authority if the governor or legislature has not provided for an allocation formula different from that provided in section 103(n) (2) and (3)?</p><p class="depth0">A-13: Except as provided in this A-13 or in A-8, A-14, or A-15 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T, no issuing authority may assign, directly or indirectly, all or any portion of its private activity bond limit to any other issuing authority, and no such attempted assignment will be effective. However, a general purpose governmental unit may assign a portion of its private activity bond limit to (i) a constituted authority empowered to issue private activity bonds

on behalf of the assigning governmental unit, and (ii) a special purpose governmental unit deriving sovereign powers from the governmental unit making the assignment. In addition, a State may assign a portion of its private activity bond limit to a constituted authority empowered to issue private activity bonds on behalf of any governmental unit within such State and to any governmental unit within such State. Finally, an issuing authority that is assigned all or a portion of the private activity bond limit of a governmental unit pursuant to the immediately preceding two sentences may assign such amount or any part thereof to the governmental unit from which it received the assignment. None of these permissible types of assignments shall be effective, however, unless made in writing by a duly authorized official of the governmental unit making the assignment and a record of the assignment is maintained by the assignee for the term of all private activity bonds it issues in each calendar year to which such assignment applies. None of these permissible types of assignments shall be effective if made retroactively; provided, however, that retroactive assignments may be made during 1984. In addition, except as provided in A-15 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T, a purported assignment by a governmental unit of a portion of its private activity bond limit to an issuing authority will be ineffective to the extent that private activity bonds issued by such authority provide facilities not located within the jurisdiction of the governmental unit making the assignment, unless the sole beneficiary of the facility is the governmental unit attempting to make the assignment. Similarly, except as provided in A-15 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T, a governmental unit may not allocate a portion of its private activity bond limit to an issue of obligations to provide a facility not located within the jurisdiction of that governmental unit unless the sole beneficiary of the facility is the governmental unit attempting to allocate its private activity bond limit to the issue. If an issuing authority issues an issue of obligations a portion of the proceeds of which are to be used to provide a facility not within its jurisdiction other than one described in the immediately preceding sentence, that issue will not meet the requirements of section 103(n) unless an issuing authority within the jurisdiction of which the facility is to be located specifically allocates a portion of its private activity bond limit to such issue equal to the amount of proceeds to be used to provide such facility.</p><p class="depth0">Q-14: May an issuing authority assign a portion of its private activity bond limit to another issuing authority if the governor or legislature has provided for an allocation formula different from that provided in section 103(n) (2) and (3)?</p><p class="depth0">A-14: Yes, under certain conditions. In providing a different formula for allocating the State ceiling, a State may permit an issuing authority to assign all or a portion of its private activity bond limit to other issuing authorities within the State, provided that such assignment is made in writing and a record of that assignment is maintained by the assignee in its records for the term of all private activity bonds it issues in each calendar year to which such assignment applies and a record of that assignment is maintained during such period by the public official responsible for making allocations of the State ceiling to issuing authorities within the State. The preceding sentence will only apply where the different formula expressly permits such assignments. Notwithstanding this A-14, no assignments may be made to regional authorities without compliance with the provisions of A-15 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T.</p><p class="depth0">Q-15: May a general purpose governmental unit assign a portion of its private activity bond limit to a regional authority empowered to issue private activity bonds on behalf of two or more general purpose governmental units?</p><p class="depth0">A-15: Yes, under certain conditions. In order for an issue of private activity bonds issued by such a regional authority to meet the requirements of section 103(n), each of the governmental units on behalf of which the regional authority issues private activity bonds must assign to the regional authority a portion of its private activity bond limit based on the ratio of its population to the aggregate population of all such

governmental units. The governmental unit within the jurisdiction of which the facility to be provided by the private activity bonds will be located, however, may elect to treat the regional authority as if it were a constituted authority empowered to issue such obligations solely on behalf of that governmental unit and, therefore, may assign a portion of its limit to the authority solely to provide the facility within its jurisdiction. Similarly, if a facility will solely benefit one governmental unit, that governmental unit may make the election described in the preceding sentence. In addition, any of the governmental units on behalf of which the regional authority issues private activity bonds, other than the governmental unit within the jurisdiction of which the facility will be located, may elect to be treated as if it had not empowered the authority to issue that issue of private activity bonds on its behalf. In providing a different formula for allocating the State ceiling, a State may permit a governmental unit to assign all or a portion of its private activity bond limit to a constituted authority empowered to issue private activity bonds on behalf of two or more governmental units, all of which are located within the State. The preceding sentence will only apply where the different formula expressly so provides. The principles of this A-15 shall not apply to any regional authority created with a principal purpose of avoiding the restrictions provided in A-13 or A-14 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T. The principles of this A-15 shall also apply to a special purpose governmental unit providing facilities located within the jurisdiction of two or more general purpose governmental units from which it derives sovereign powers.</p><p class="depth0">Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of A-8 through A-15 of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Authority ZZ is empowered by City Y to issue obligations on its behalf to provide financing for pollution control facilities located within the jurisdiction of City Y and the geographical area within 10 miles of the limits of City Y. Authority ZZ has no sovereign powers. Although the authority of Authority ZZ to issue obligations enables it to provide facilities located outside of the jurisdiction of City Y, Authority ZZ is treated as having jurisdiction over the same geographical area as City Y. Since City Y has broader sovereign powers than Authority ZZ, under section 103(n)(3) Authority ZZ has a private activity bond limit of zero. On March 31, 1985, Authority ZZ issues $5 million of private activity bonds. City Y has not assigned any portion of its private activity bond limit to Authority ZZ. Thus, the March 31, 1985, issue of private activity bonds is treated as an issue of obligations not described in section 103(a), and the interest on such obligations is subject to Federal income taxation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In 1972, State S, State T, and State V empowered Authority Z to issue industrial development bonds on behalf of the three States and to provide port facilities in a harbor serving residents of all three States. S, T, and V have populations of 1,000,000, 2,000,000, and 7,000,000, respectively. Authority Z will issue $100 million of private activity bonds on September 1, 1985, to finance construction of a dock to be located in State S. The obligations will not meet the requirements of section 103(n) unless S, T, and V assign a portion of their private activity bond limits to Authority Z pursuant to one of three methods. First, S, T, and V may assign $10 million, $20 million, and $70 million, respectively, of their private activity bond limits to Authority Z for this issue. Second, S, T, and V may assign $100 million, $0, and $0, respectively, of their private activity bond limits to Authority Z for this issue. Third, either T or V (but not S) may allocate $0 of its private activity bond limit to Authority Z for purposes of this issue, and the remaining two States may allocate the $100 million based upon their respective populations. For instance, if T were to allocate $0 for purposes of this issue, S and V must allocate $12.5 million and $87.5 million, respectively, of their private activity bond limits to Authority Z.</p><p class="depth0">Q-16: Must an issuing authority allocate any of its private activity bond limit to certain preliminarily approved projects?</p><p class="depth0">A-16: Yes. Section 631(a)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 provides that, with respect to certain projects preliminarily approved by an issuing authority before October 19, 1983, the issuing authority shall allocate its share of the private activity bond limit for the calendar year during which the obligations are to be issued first to those projects. For purposes of this A-16 and A-17 and A-18 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T, a general purpose governmental unit will be treated as having preliminarily approved a project if the project was preliminarily approved by it, by a constituted authority empowered to issue

private activity bonds on its behalf, or by a special purpose governmental unit treated as having jurisdiction over the same geographical area as the general purpose governmental unit. Thus, if a project was approved by a constituted authority, the governmental unit on behalf of which such issue is to be issued must assign a portion of its private activity bond limit to the authority pursuant to section 631(a)(3) of the Act. If a project was preliminarily approved by a constituted authority empowered to issue private activity bonds on behalf or more than one general purpose governmental unit or a special purpose governmental unit that derives its sovereign powers from more than one general purpose governmental unit, the project will be considered approved by each of such general purpose governmental units in proportion to their relative populations. The projects that receive priority under section 631(a)(3) of the Act and this A-16 are those with respect to which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There was an inducement resolution (or other comparable preliminary approval) for a project before October 19, 1983, by an issuing authority,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A substantial user of the project notified such issuing authority--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> By August 17, 1984, that it intended to claim its rights under section 631(a)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> By December 31, 1984, as to the calendar year in which it expects the obligations to provide the project to be issued, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Construction of such project began before October 19, 1983, or a substantial user was under a binding obligation on that date to incur significant expenditures with respect to the project.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term ``significant expenditures'' means expenditures that equal or exceed the lesser of $15 million or 20 percent of the estimated cost of the facilities. An issuing authority may require, as part of the submission required by (ii)(B) of this A-16, that a substantial user specify the aggregate amount of private activity bonds necessary for the project. Section 631(a)(3) does not apply to a project to the extent that the aggregate amount of obligations required for such project exceeds the amount, if any, provided for in the inducement resolution or resolutions in existence with respect to such project before October 19, 1983, or in the statement that may be required by the issuing authority as part of the submission required by (ii)(B) of this A-16. Similarly, section 631(a)(3) does not apply to a project to the extent of any material change in its nature, character, purpose, or capacity. Section 631(a)(3) does not apply to a project if the owner, operator, or manager of such project is not the same (or a related person) as the owner, operator, or manager named in the latest inducement resolution with respect to such project in existence before October 19, 1983. Section 631(a)(3) of the Act does not apply to any project if the obligations to provide the project are not issued in the year specified in the submission required by (ii)(B) of this A-16. In addition, section 631(a)(3) of the Act does not apply to any project to the extent that the amount of obligations to be issued for such project exceeds the share of the State ceiling to which the issuing authority that authorized the project is entitled as determined under section 103(n) (2) and (3) without regard to any alternative formula for allocating the State ceiling. The requirements of section 631(a)(3) will not apply where a State statute specifically so provides.</p><p class="depth0">Q-17: What is the penalty for failure to comply with the requirements of section 631(a)(3) of the Act?</p><p class="depth0">A-17: If any issuing authority fails to comply with the requirements of section 631(a)(3) of the Act, its private activity bond limit for the calendar year following the year in which the failure occurs shall be reduced by the amount of private activity bonds with respect to which the failure occurs. This penalty applies whether the issuing authority's private activity bond limit is determined under the formula provided under section 103(n) (2) and (3) or a different formula provided under section 103(n)(6). The penalty is imposed on the issuing authority that failed to comply with the requirements of section 631(a)(3) or, if in the year in which

the penalty is imposed the issuing authority does not have a sufficient private activity bond limit to absorb the entire penalty, on the general purpose governmental unit treated as having jurisdiction over the same geographical area as the issuing authority. For purposes of this A-17, the general purpose governmental unit's private activity bond limit includes the private activity bond limit of each issuing authority treated as having preliminarily approved the project under A-16 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-3T. Thus, for example, if a governmental unit failed to comply with the requirements of section 631(a)(3) of the Act with respect to a $5 million issue to be issued in 1985, and that governmental unit is assigned $15 million of the State ceiling for 1986 pursuant to a formula provided under section 103(n)(6), that governmental unit has a private activity bond limit of $10 million for 1986. Similarly, where a project that was preliminarily approved by an issuing authority that is not a governmental unit qualifies for $10 million of priority under section 631(a)(3) of the Act is not allocated a total of $10 million by the governmental unit on behalf of which the issuing authority is empowered to issue private activity bonds, the issuing authority's private activity bond limit, if any, for the year following this failure is reduced by $10 million; if the issuing authority's private activity bond limit for the year following the failure is less than $10 million, the private activity bond limit of the governmental unit on behalf of which the private activity bonds would have been issued had the failure not occurred (including if necessary, on a proportionate basis, the private activity bond limit purported to have been assigned to each of the other constituted authorities empowered to issue private activity bonds on behalf of the governmental unit and each special purpose governmental unit deriving all or part of its sovereign powers from the governmental unit) is reduced by the difference between $10 million and the reduction made in the issuing authority's private activity bond limit with respect to such failure.</p><p class="depth0">Q-18: Will a penalty be assessed for failure to allocate private activity bond limit to all projects that meet the requirements section 631(a)(3) if the amount of obligations required by all such projects preliminarily approved by (or treated as having been preliminarily approved by) an issuing authority exceeds the private activity bond limit of such issuing authority?</p><p class="depth0">A-18: No penalty will be assessed if priority is given to those eligible projects for which substantial expenditures were incurred before October 19, 1983. An issuer may define the term ``substantial expenditures'' in any reasonable manner based on the relevant facts and circumstances and its private activity bond limit.</p><p class="depth0">Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of A-16 through A-18:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On October 1, 1983, County S approved an inducement resolution for the issuance of up to $30 million of industrial development bonds to provide a pollution control facility described in section 103(b)(4)(F) for Corporation R. On October 5, 1983, R contracted with Corporation Q to begin construction of the pollution control facility immediately, and construction began on October 10, 1983. Not later than August 17, 1984, Corporation R notified County S that it intended to seek priority under section 631(a)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984. In addition, prior to December 31, 1984, Corporation R notified County S that it expected the County to issue $25 million of industrial development bonds for its project during calendar year 1985. Under section 103(n)(3), County S has a private activity bond limit of $50 million for calendar year 1985, and neither the Governor nor the legislature of the State has provided a different allocation formula under section 103(n)(6). There are no other projects approved by County S that have rights under section 631(a)(3). On March 1, 1985, County S issues $25 million of industrial development bonds for the pollution control facility for Corporation R. If County S allocates less than $25 million of its private activity bond limit to that project, its private activity bond limit for 1986 will be reduced by the difference between $25 million and the amount County S actually allocates to the project.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that during 1984 Corporation R fails to notify County S of the year in which it expects the obligations to be issued. Upon such failure the pollution control facility no longer qualifies for priority under section 631(a)(3), and County S will not be penalized if it does not not allocate any of its private activity bond limit for 1985, or any future year, to that project.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that under section 103(n)(3) County S has a private activity bond limit of $10 million for 1985. County S will not be penalized if it allocates $10 million of its private activity bond limit to the project.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example (3) except that on December 31, 1984, the Governor of the State provides a different allocation from that provided under section 103(n) (2) and (3). (The State has not enacted a statute specifically providing that section 631(a)(3) does not apply.) The different allocation provides that the entire State ceiling is allocated to the State and that the State will allocate the State ceiling to issuing authorities for specific projects on a first-come, first-served basis. Corporation R qualifies for the special rights granted by section 631(a)(3) of the Tax Reform Act to the extent of County S's private activity bond limit as determined under section 103(n)(3), i.e., $10 million. If the State fails to assign to County S $10 million of the State ceiling or if County S, after receiving such assignment, fails to allocate $10 million of private activity bond limit to the project, County S's private activity bond limit (if any) for 1986 will be reduced by the difference between $10 million and the amount of private activity bond limit allocated to the project.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that Corporation R notifies County S that it only requires $15 million for the pollution control facility, County S only issues $15 million of private activity bonds for the pollution control facility, and County S only allocates $15 million of its private activity bond limit to such obligations. County S will not be penalized for not allocating more than $15 million of its private activity bond limit to Corporation R even though the original inducement resolution provided for up to $25 million.

Thus, for example, obligations issued to finance a carryforward project with a different initial owner, operator, or manager from the owner, operator, or manager specified in the carryforward election shall not be issued purusant to such carryforward election. An insubstantial deviation from a specification contained in a carryforward election shall not prevent obligations from being issued pursuant to such carryforward election. In addition, where a carryforward election is made with respect to more than one carryforward project, a substantial deviation with respect to one carryforward project shall not prevent obligations from being issued pursuant to such carryforward election with respect to the other carryforward projects.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: How is a carryforward used?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: Any private activity bonds issued during the three calendar years (six calendar years in the case of a project described in section 103(b)(4)(F)) following the calendard year in which the carryforward election was first made with respect to a carryforward project shall not be taken into account in determining whether the issue meets the requirements of section 103(n). If, however, the amount of private activity bonds issued for the carryforward project exceeds the amount of the carryforward elected with respect to the project, then the portion of the issue that exceeds the carryforward shall be taken into account in determining whether the issue meets with the requirements of section 103(n); if that portion of the issue does not meet the requirements of section 103(n) then the entire issue is treated as consisting of obligations not described in section 103(a). Carryforwards elected with respect to any project shall be used in the order of the calendar years in which they arose. Thus, for example, if an issuing authority makes carryforward elections in 1986 and 1988 for a carryforward project and issues private activity bonds for that project in 1989 and 1990, the obligations issued in 1989 will be applied to the 1986 carryforward election to the extent thereof.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: For what projects may a carryforward election be made?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: A carryforward election may be made for any project described in section 103(b) (4) or (5), and for the purpose of issuing student loan bonds.

In addition, a governmental unit may elect to carry forward its unused private activity bond limit in order to issue qualified scholarship funding bonds. An issuing authority may not, however, elect to

carry forward its unused private activity bond limit in order to issue an exempt small issue of industrial development bonds under section 103(b)(6).

Sec. 1.103(n)-6T  Determinations of population (temporary).</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What is the proper method for determining population?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: All determinations of population must be made with respect to any calendar year on the basis of the most recent census estimate (whether final or provisional) of the resident population of the State or other governmental unit published by the Bureau of the Census in the ``Current Population Reports'' series before the beginning of the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">However, determinations of the population of a general purpose governmental unit (other than a State, territory, or possession) within a State, territory, or possession may not be based on estimates that do not contain estimates for all of the general purpose governmental units within such State, territory, or possession. Thus, a county may not determine its population on the basis of a census estimate that does not provide an estimate of the population of the other general purpose governmental units within the State (e.g., cities, towns). If no census estimate is available for all such general purpose governmental units, the most recent decennial census of population may be relied on.</p><p class="depth0">Example: The following example illustrates the provisions of A-1 of this Sec. 1.103(n)-6T:</p><p class="depth0">Example. County Q is located within State R. There are no constitutional home rule cities in State R. State R has not adopted a formula for allocating the State ceiling different from the formula provided in section 103(n) (2) and (3). The geographical area within the jurisdiction of County Q is not within the jurisdiction of any other governmental unit having jurisdiction over a smaller geographical area. As of December 31, 1984, the Bureau of the Census has published the following estimates of resident population: ``Current Population Reports; Series P-25: Population Estimates and Projections, Estimates of the Population of States: July 1, 1981-1983'' and ``Current Population Reports; Series P-26: Local Population Estimates:

Population of State R, Counties, Incorporated Places, and Minor Civil Divisions: July 1, 1981-1982.'' The most recent population estimate for State R available prior to 1985 provides population estimates as of July 1, 1983. The most recent population extimates for County Q available prior to 1985 is the estimate for July 1, 1982. Assuming that the State ceiling for State R for 1985 is in excess of $200 million (i.e., $150 multiplied by the estimated population of State R as of July 1, 1983, exceeds $200 million), County Q may determine its private activity bond limit by using the following formula:
P = $150 x .5 x W x Y / Z, where,
P = County Q's private activity bond limit,W = the July 1, 1983, population estimate for State R,Y = the July 1, 1982, population estimate for County Q, andZ = the July 1, 1982, population estimate for State R.

If the State ceiling for State R is not in excess of $200 million, County Q may determine its private activity bond limit by using the following formula:
P = $200,000,000 x .5 x Y / Z, whereP, Y, and Z have the same meaning as above.

Information with respect to gross monthly income may be obtained from available loan documents, e.g., the sum of lines 23D and 23E on the Application for VA or FmHA Home Loan Guaranty or for HUD/FHA Insured Mortgage (VA Form 26-1802a, HUD 92900, Jan. 1982), or the total line from the Gross Monthly Income section of FHLMC Residential Loan Application form (FHLMC 65 Rev. 8/78). With respect to obligations issued prior to October 1, 1985, issuers may submit data based on annualized gross income or, instead, based on the adjusted income (as defined in Sec. 1.167(k)-3(b)(3)) of the mortgagor's family for the previous calendar year.

In addition, any report submitted not later

than December 31, 1984, with respect to which an issuer in good faith attempted to satisfy the requirements of section 103A(j)(5) shall be treated as substantially satisfying the requirements of this paragraph. For example, with respect to a report submitted not later than December 31, 1984, an issuer shall not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of section 103A(j)(5) based on the fact that (A) the notice of public hearing failed to state the manner in which affected residents may obtain copies of the proposed report prior to the hearing, or (B) the proposed report was not available prior to or at the public hearing. With respect to reports required to be published and submitted to the Commissioner not later than December 31, 1986, the Commissioner has determined that there is a reasonable cause for the failure to publish and file such reports in a timely fashion; such reports will be considered published and filed in a timely fashion if, not later than December 31, 1987, the report is published (after having a public hearing following reasonable public notice) and a copy is submitted to the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions and special rules.

For purposes of the report required to be filed prior to January 1, 1986, an issuer need not perform these assessments of compliance with respect to any period prior to January 1, 1985.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An issuer that fails to establish policies with respect to the criteria provided in paragraph (l)(3)(i) of this section will not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph. Thus, for example, an issuer may state in its report that none of the proceeds of the issue will be targeted to specific areas. Similarly, an issuer that fails to successfully implement its policies will not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Public hearing. The public hearing required by paragraph (l)(1) of this section means a forum providing a reasonable opportunity for interested individuals to express their views, both orally and in writing, on the report that the applicable representative proposes to publish to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (l). A public hearing held prior to January 1, 1985, will not fail to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (l)(4) merely because the proposed policy statement was not available prior to the public hearing. In general, a governmental unit may select its own procedure for the hearing, provided that interested individuals have a reasonable opportunity to express their views. Thus, it may impose reasonable requirements on persons who wish to participate in the hearing, such as a requirement that persons desiring to speak at the hearing so request in writing at least 24 hours before the hearing or that they limit their oral remarks to 10 minutes. For purposes of this public hearing requirement, it is not necessary that the applicable elected representative who will publish the report be present at the hearing, that a report on the hearing be submitted to that official, or that State administrative procedural requirements for public hearings in general be observed. However, compliance with such State procedural requirements (except those at variance with a specific requirement set forth in this paragraph) will generally assure that the hearing satisfies the requirements of this paragraph. The hearing may be conducted by any individual appointed or employed to perform such function by the governmental unit, its agencies, or by the issuer. Thus, for example, for a report to be issued by an issuing authority that acts on behalf of a county, the hearing may be conducted by the issuing authority, the county, or an appointee or employee of either.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reasonable public notice. (i) The reasonable public notice required by paragraph (l)(1) of this section means published notice which is reasonably designed to inform residents of the geographical area within the jurisdiction of the governmental unit that will publish the report. The notice must state the time and place for the hearing and contain the information required by paragraph (l)(5)(ii) of this section. Notice is presumed reasonable if published no fewer than 14 days before the hearing. Notice is presumed reasonably designed to inform affected residents only if published in one or more newspapers of general circulation available to residents of that locality or if announced by radio or televison broadcast to those residents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The reasonable public notice required by paragraph (l)(1) of this section means published notice which is reasonably designed to inform residents of the geographical area within the jurisdiction of the governmental unit that will publish the report.

Notice is presumed reasonable if published no fewer than 14 days before the hearing.

In the case of an issuer that issues qualified mortgage bonds on behalf of two or more governmental units (``multiple jurisdiction issuer''), each governmental unit on whose behalf the issuer reasonably expects to issue qualified mortgage bonds during the succeeding calendar year must hold a public hearing following reasonable public notice prior to the publication of the report required by this paragraph. A multiple jurisdiction issuer may hold a combined hearing as long as the combined hearing is a joint undertaking that provides all residents of the participating governmental units (i.e., each governmental unit on whose behalf qualified mortgage bonds were issued by the authority and each governmental unit on whose behalf the authority reasonably expects to issue qualified mortgage bonds during the succeeding calendar year) a reasonable opportunity to be heard. The location of any combined hearing is presumed to provide a reasonable opportunity for

all affected residents to be heard if it is no farther than 100 miles from the seat of government of each participating governmental unit beyond whose geographic jurisdiction the hearing is conducted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Place for filing. The report is to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19255.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> State certification requirements--(1) In general.

(i) An issue satisfied the requirements of section 103A(j)(4) and this paragraph (m)(2) only if the State official designated by law (or, if there is no State official, the Governor) certifies on or before the later of the date of issue or October 3, 1985, following a request for such certification by the issuer, that, as of the date the certification is executed, the issue meets the requirements of section 103A(g) and the regulations thereunder (relating to volume limitation). In the case of any constitutional home rule city, the certification shall be made by the chief executive officer of the city.

If, based on such information, the certifying official determines that, as of the date the certification is executed, the issue will not exceed the issuer's market limitation for the year, the official may certify that the issue meets the requirements of section 103A(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule. If 15 days elapse after the issuer files a proper request for the certification described in paragraph (m)(2) of this section and the issuer has not received from the State official designated by law (or, if there is no State official, the Governor) certification that the issue meets the requirements of section 103A(g) and Sec. 6a.103A-2(g) or, in the alternative, a statement that the issue does not meet such requirements, the issuer may, instead, submit an affidavit executed by an officer of the issuer responsible for issuing the bonds stating that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The issue meets the requirements of section 103(A)(g) and Sec. 6a.103A-2(g),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At least 15 days before the execution of the affidavit the issuer filed a proper request for the certification described in paragraph (m)(2) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The State official designated by law (or, if there is no State official, the Governor) has not provided the certification described in paragraph (m)(2) of this section.
In the case of obligations issued prior to October 4, 1985 the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting ``30 days'' for ``15 days''. For purposes of this paragraph, a request for certification is proper if the request includes the reports and affidavits described in paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Filing. The certification (or affidavit) required by this paragraph shall be filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, PA 19255. The certification (or affidavit) shall be
