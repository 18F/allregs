                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Name. The name of the viticultural area described in this section is ``Sonoma Coast''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved map. The approved maps for determining the boundary of the Sonoma Coast viticultural area are the following six U.S.G.S. topographic maps:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sonoma County, California, scale 1:100,000, dated 1970;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mark West Springs, California, 7.5-minute series, dated 1958, photoinspected 1978;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Healdsburg, California, 7.5-minute series, dated 1955, photorevised 1980;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Jimtown, California, 7.5-minute series, dated 1955, photorevised 1975;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Guerneville, California, 7.5-minute series, dated 1955; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Cazadero, California, 7.5-minute series, dated 1978.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boundary description. In general, the boundary description of the Sonoma Coast viticultural area is found on the U.S.G.S. Topographic Map of Sonoma County, California, scale 1:100,000, dated 1970. When a point of the boundary description is found on one of the 7.5-minute quadrangles, the boundary description indicates this in parentheses. The boundary description is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The beginning point is the point at which the Sonoma County-Mendocino County line meets the shoreline of the Pacific Ocean.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The boundary follows the shoreline of the Pacific Ocean southerly to the Sonoma County-Marin County line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The boundary follows the Sonoma County-Marin County line southeasterly to San Pablo Bay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The boundary follows the shoreline of San Pablo Bay easterly to the Sonoma County-Napa County line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The boundary follows the Sonoma County-Napa County line northerly to the peak of Arrowhead Mountain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> From the peak of Arrowhead Mountain, the boundary proceeds in a straight line westerly to the peak of Sonoma Mountain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> From the peak of Sonoma Mountain, the boundary proceeds in a straight line northwesterly to the peak of Taylor Mountain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> From the peak of Taylor Mountain, the boundary proceeds in a straight line northwesterly to the point, near the benchmark at 184 ft. elevation in Section 34, Township 8 North, Range 8 West, at which Mark West Road crosses an unnamed stream which flows northwesterly into Mark West Creek. (Mark West Springs map)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> From this point, the boundary proceeds northerly in a straight line to the headwaters of Brooks Creek, in Section 4, Township 8 North, Range 8 West. (Mark West Springs map)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The boundary follows Brooks Creek northwesterly to its confluence with the Russian River.

(Healdsburg map)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> The boundary proceeds westerly in a straight line to the peak of Fitch Mountain at elevation 991 ft. (Healdsburg map)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> The boundary proceeds northwesterly in a straight line to the intersection, near a benchmark at elevation 154 ft. in the town of Chiquita, of a light-duty road (known locally as Chiquita Road) and a southbound primary highway, hard surface road (known locally as Healdsburg Avenue). (Jimtown map)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> The boundary follows that road (known locally as Healdsburg Avenue) southerly through the city of Healdsburg to the point at which it is a light-duty, hard or improved surface road, identified on the map as Redwood Highway, which crosses the Russian River, immediately south of the city of Healdsburg at a bridge (known locally as the Healdsburg Avenue Bridge). (Healdsburg map)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> The boundary follows the Russian River southerly to a point, near the confluence with Dry Creek, opposite a straight line extension of a light-duty, hard or improved surface road (known locally as Foreman Lane) located west of the Russian River. (Healdsburg map)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> The boundary proceeds in a straight line to that road and follows it westerly, then south, then westerly, onto the Guerneville map, across a secondary highway, hard surface road (known locally as Westside Road), and continues westerly, then northwesterly to the point at which it crosses Felta Creek. (Guerneville map)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> The boundary follows Felta Creek approximately 18,000 ft. westerly to its headwaters, at the confluence of three springs, located approximately 5,800 feet northwesterly of Wild Hog Hill. (Guerneville map)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(20)</em> The boundary proceeds in a straight line southwesterly to the southwest corner of Section 9, Township 8 North, Range 10 West.
