                            <p class="depth0">We will assist Indian landowners in leasing their land for agricultural purposes. For the purposes of Secs. 162.102 through 162.256:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> We will assist Indian landowners in leasing their land, either through negotiations or advertisement. In reviewing a negotiated lease for approval, we will defer to the landowners' determination that the lease is in their best interest, to the maximum extent possible. In granting a lease on the landowners' behalf, we will obtain a fair annual rental and attempt to ensure (through proper notice) that the use of the land is consistent with the landowners' wishes. We will also recognize the rights of Indian landowners to

use their own land, so long as their Indian co-owners are in agreement and the value of the land is preserved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We will recognize the governing authority of the tribe having jurisdiction over the land to be leased, preparing and advertising leases in accordance with applicable tribal laws and policies. We will promote tribal control and self-determination over tribal land and other land under the tribe's jurisdiction, through contracts and self-governance compacts entered into under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C. Sec. 450f et seq.
