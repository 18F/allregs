                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acknowledgements of requests. On receipt of a request, a component ordinarily shall send an acknowledgement letter to the requester which shall confirm the requester's agreement to pay fees under Sec. 5.21(c) and provide an assigned request number for further reference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grants of requests for access. Once a component makes a determination to grant a request for access in whole or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing. The component shall inform the requester in the notice of any fee charged under Sec. 5.29 and shall disclose records to the requester promptly on payment of any applicable fee. If a request is made in person, the component may disclose records to the requester directly, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive of its operations, on payment of any applicable fee and with a written record made of the grant of the request. If a requester is accompanied by another person, the requester shall be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adverse determinations of requests for access. A component making an adverse determination denying a request for access in any respect shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, consist of: a determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that what has been requested is not a record subject to the Privacy Act; a determination on any disputed fee matter; and a denial of a request for expedited treatment. The notification letter shall be signed by the head of the component, or the component head's designee, and shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any Privacy Act exemption(s) applied by the component in denying the request; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement that the denial may be appealed under Sec. 5.25(a) and a description of the requirements of Sec. 5.25(a).</p>
