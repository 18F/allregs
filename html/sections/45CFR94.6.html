                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the failure of an Investigator to comply with an  Institution's financial conflicts of interest policy or a financial  conflict of interest management plan appears to have biased the design,  conduct, or reporting of the PHS-funded research, the Institution shall  promptly notify the PHS Awarding Component of the corrective action   taken or to be taken. The PHS Awarding Component will consider the  situation and, as necessary, take appropriate action, or refer the  matter to the Institution for further action, which may include  directions to the Institution on how to maintain appropriate objectivity  in the PHS-funded research project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The PHS Awarding Component and/or HHS may inquire at any time  (before, during, or after award) into any Investigator disclosure of  financial interests and the Institution's review of, and response to,  such disclosure, regardless of whether or not the disclosure resulted in  the Institution's determination of a financial conflict of interest. An  Institution is required to submit, or permit on site review of, all  records pertinent to compliance with this part. To the extent permitted  by law, HHS will maintain the confidentiality of all records of  financial interests. On the basis of its review of records or other  information that may be available, the PHS Awarding Component may decide  that a particular financial conflict of interest will bias the  objectivity of the PHS-funded research to such an extent that further  corrective action is needed or that the Institution has not managed the  financial conflict of interest in accordance with this part. The PHS  Awarding Component may determine that issuance of a Stop Work Order by  the Contracting Officer or other enforcement action is necessary until  the matter is resolved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In any case in which the HHS determines that a PHS-funded  project of clinical research whose purpose is to evaluate the safety or  effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment has been designed,  conducted, or reported by an Investigator with a financial conflict of  interest that was not managed or reported by the Institution as required  by this part, the Institution shall require the Investigator involved to  disclose the financial conflict of interest in each public presentation  of the results of the research and to request an addendum to previously  published presentations.</p>
