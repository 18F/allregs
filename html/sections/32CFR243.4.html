                                Sec. 243.4  Ratemaking procedures for Civil Reserve Air Fleet contracts.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The ratemaking procedures contained within this section apply only  to Airlift Service contracts awarded based on CRAF commitment.  Competitively awarded contracts may be used by the Department of Defense  when it considers such contracts to be in the best interest of the  government. See Secs. 243.5(b) and 243.6 for exclusions to ratemaking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Rates of payment for airlift services. USTRANSCOM may utilize  the principles contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as  supplemented, in establishing fair and reasonable rate of payments for  airlift service contracts in support of CRAF. Specific exceptions to FAR  are noted in Sec. 243.8 of this rule. To facilitate uniformity within  the ratemaking process, USTRANSCOM will execute a MOU with air carriers  to institute the basis for methods upon which the rates will be  established. An updated MOU will be executed as warranted and published  for public comment on FedBizOps. Under the MOU, air carriers agree to  furnish historical cost and operational data, as well as their projected  rates for the ensuing fiscal year. USTRANSCOM will conduct a review of  air carriers' historical and projected costs and negotiate with the  carriers to establish rates using ratemaking methodologies contained in  the attachment to the MOU.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Obtaining data from participating carriers. USTRANSCOM will  annually notify those participating carriers to provide data using the  USTRANSCOM cost package and related instructions. The data provided  includes pricing data, cost data, and judgmental information necessary  for the USTRANSCOM contracting officer to determine a fair and  reasonable price or to determine cost realism. Carriers will be provided  60 calendar days to act upon the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Analysis. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> USTRANSCOM will consider carrier reported DOT Form  41   costs as well as other applicable costs directly assigned to performance  in USTRANSCOM service. These costs will be reviewed and analyzed by  USTRANSCOM for allowability, allocability, and reasonableness. Costs may  also be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), as  necessary, in accordance with the DCAA Contract Audit Manual 7640.01.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To determine allocation of these costs to USTRANSCOM service,  USTRANSCOM considers carrier reported DOT Form 41 operational data, as  well as USTRANSCOM S-1, S-2 mileage reports, fuel reports, and other  relevant information requested by the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rates. Rates will be determined by aircraft class (e.g., large  passenger, medium passenger, large cargo, etc.) based on the average  efficiency of all participating carriers within the specified class.  Application of these rates, under varying conditions (e.g., ferry, one- way, etc), are addressed in the Final Rates published in accordance with  Sec. 243.4(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Components of the rate--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Return on Investment (ROI). ROI for  USTRANSCOM service is intended to adequately compensate carriers for  cost of capital. USTRANSCOM will apply a minimum return applied to the  carrier's total operating costs. If a full return on investment applied  to a carrier's capital investment base is provided in the MOU, the  carrier will receive whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Full ROI. The full ROI will be computed using an optimal capital  structure of 45 percent debt and 55 percent equity. The cost-of-debt and  cost-of-equity are calculated from revenues of major carriers as  reported to the Department of Transportation.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Cost-of-Debt (COD). COD will be calculated considering the Risk  Free Rate (RFR) plus the weighted debt spread, with the formula as  agreed upon in the MOU.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Cost-of-Equity (COE). COE will be determined by a formula agreed  upon in the MOU, which considers RFR, weighted betas, annualized equity  risk premium and a future expected return premium.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Owned/Capital/Long-Term Leased Aircraft. New airframes and  related support parts will receive full ROI on the net book value of  equipment at mid-point of forecast year. USTRANSCOM will apply the  economic service life standards to aircraft as indicated in paragraph  (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Short-term leased aircraft. As a return on annual lease  payments, short-term leased equipment will receive the Full ROI less the  cost of money rate per the Secretary of the Treasury under Public Law  92-41 (85 Stat. 97), as provided by the Office of Management and Budget,  in accordance with the MOU.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Working capital. Working capital will be provided in the  investment base at an established number of days provided in the MOU.  The investment base will be computed on total operating cash less non  cash expenses (depreciation) as calculated by USTRANSCOM.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Minimum Return. USTRANSCOM will determine minimum return  utilizing the Weighted Guidelines methodology as set forth in DFARS  Subpart 215.4, Contract Pricing, or successor and as provided in the  MOU.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Depreciation. USTRANSCOM will apply economic life standards for  new aircraft at 14 years, 2 percent residual (narrowbody) and 16 years  and 10 percent residual (widebody) aircraft. USTRANSCOM will apply  economic life standards for used aircraft as indicated in the MOU.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Utilization. Utilization considers the number of airborne hours  flown per aircraft per day. USTRANSCOM will calculate aircraft  utilization in accordance with the DOT Form 41 reporting and the MOU.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cost escalation. Escalation is the percentage increase or  decrease applied to the historical base year costs to reliably estimate  the cost of performance in the contract period. Yearly cost escalation  will be calculated in accordance with the MOU.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Weighting of rate. Rates will be weighted based upon the direct  relationship between contract performance and cost incurred in execution  of the contract. The specific weighting will be as defined in the MOU.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Obtaining data from participating carriers. Carriers  participating in USTRANSCOM acquisitions subject to   ratemaking shall provide, other than certified cost and pricing data for  USTRANSCOM, rate reviews as required in the MOU.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Contingency rate. Authority is reserved to the Commander,  USTRANSCOM, at his discretion, during conditions such as outbreak of  war, armed conflict, insurrection, civil or military strife, emergency,  or similar conditions, to use a temporary contingency rate in order to  ensure mission accomplishment. Any such temporary rate would terminate  at the Commander's discretion upon his determination that such rate is  no longer needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Proposed rate. Once the data is analyzed and audit findings  considered, USTRANSCOM will prepare a package setting forth proposed  airlift rates and supporting data. The proposed rates will be approved  by the USTRANSCOM contracting officer and posted publicly on FedBizOps  for comment. The comment period will be as specified in the proposed  rate package.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Final rate. Upon closing of the comment period, comments and  supporting rationale will be addressed and individual negotiations  conducted between USTRANSCOM and the air carriers. After negotiations  have concluded, USTRANSCOM will prepare a rate package setting forth  final airlift rates for each aircraft class, along with supporting data  consisting of individual carrier cost elements. Comments and disposition  of those comments will be included in the final rate package. The final  rates will be approved by the USTRANSCOM contracting officer and  publicly posted on FedBizOps for use in the ensuing contract.</p>
