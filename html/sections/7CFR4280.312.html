The loan will be considered  approved on the date the signed copy of Form RD 1940-1, ``Request for  Obligation of Funds,'' is signed by the Agency. Form RD 1940-1  authorizes funds to be obligated and may be executed by the Agency  provided the microlender has the legal authority to contract for a loan,  and to enter into required agreements, including an Agency-approved loan  agreement, and meets all program loan requirements and has signed Form  RD 1940-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Letter of conditions. Upon reviewing the conditions and  requirements in the letter of conditions, the applicant must complete,  sign, and return Form RD 1942-46, ``Letter of Intent to Meet  Conditions,'' to the Agency; or if certain conditions cannot be met, the  applicant may propose alternate conditions. The Agency will review any  requests for changes to the letter of conditions. The Agency may approve  only minor changes that do not materially affect the microlender.  Changes in legal entities prior to loan closing will not be approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Loan closing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to loan closing, microlenders must  provide evidence that the RMRF and LLRF bank accounts have been set up  and the LLRF has been, or will be, funded as described in Sec.  4280.311(g)(4). Such evidence shall consist of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A pre-authorized debit form allowing the Agency to withdraw  payments from the RMRF account, and in the event of a repayment workout,  from the LLRF account;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An Agency-approved automatic deposit authorization form from  the depository institution providing the Agency with the RMRF account  number into which funds may be deposited at time of disbursement to the  microlender;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement from the depository institution as to the amount  of cash in the LLRF account;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An Agency-approved promissory note must be executed at loan  closing; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An appropriate security agreement on the LLRF and RMRF accounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At loan closing, the microlender must certify that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All requirements of the letter of conditions have been met and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There has been no material adverse change in the microlender or  its financial condition since the issuance of the letter of conditions.  If one or more adverse changes have occurred, the microlender must  explain the changes and the Agency must determine that the microlender  remains eligible and qualified to participate as an MDO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The microlender will provide sufficient evidence, which may  include but is not limited to, mechanics' lien waivers or in their  absence receipts of payment, that no lawsuits are pending or threatened  that would adversely affect the security of the microlender when Agency  security instruments are filed.</p>
