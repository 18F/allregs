                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A water quality standard (WQS) defines the water quality goals of a  water body, or portion thereof, by designating the use or uses to be  made of the water and by setting criteria necessary to protect the uses.  States and EPA adopt WQS to protect public health or welfare, enhance  the quality of water and serve the purposes of the Clean Water Act  (CWA). Serve the purposes of Act (as defined in sections 101(a)(2) and  303(c) of the Act) means that WQS should, wherever attainable, provide  water quality for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish and  wildlife and for recreation in and on the water and take into  consideration their use and value for public water supplies, propagation  of fish, shellfish, wildlife, recreation in and on the water, and  agricultural, industrial and other purposes including navigation.  Such standards serve the dual purposes of establishing the water quality  goals for a specific water body and serving as the regulatory basis for  establishment of water quality-based treatment controls and strategies  beyond the technology-based level of treatment required by sections  301(b) and 306 of the Act. States shall review and revise WQS in  accordance with applicable regulations and, as appropriate, update their  Water Quality Management (WQM) plans to reflect such revisions.   Specific WQS requirements are found in 40 CFR part 131.</p>
