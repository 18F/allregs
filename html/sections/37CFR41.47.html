                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An oral hearing should be requested only in those circumstances  in which appellant considers such a hearing necessary or desirable for a  proper presentation of the appeal. An appeal decided on the briefs  without an oral hearing will receive the same consideration by the Board  as appeals decided after an oral hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em>  within two months from the date of the examiner's   answer or on the date of filing of a reply brief, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If no request and fee for oral hearing have been timely filed by  appellant as required by paragraph (b) of this section, the appeal will  be assigned for consideration and decision on the briefs without an oral  hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If appellant has complied with all the requirements of paragraph  (b) of this section, a date for the oral hearing will be set, and due  notice thereof given to appellant. If an oral hearing is held, an oral  argument may be presented by, or on behalf of, the primary examiner if  considered desirable by either the primary examiner or the Board. A  hearing will be held as stated in the notice, and oral argument will  ordinarily be limited to twenty minutes for appellant and fifteen  minutes for the primary examiner unless otherwise ordered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appellant will argue first and may reserve time for rebuttal.  At the oral hearing, appellant may only rely on Evidence that has been  previously entered and considered by the primary examiner and present  argument that has been relied upon in the brief or reply brief except as  permitted by paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The primary examiner may  only rely on argument and Evidence relied upon in an answer except as  permitted by paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon a showing of good cause, appellant and/or the primary  examiner may rely on a new argument based upon a recent relevant  decision of either the Board or a Federal Court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notwithstanding the submission of a request for oral hearing  complying with this rule, if the Board decides that a hearing is not  necessary, the Board will so notify appellant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Extensions of time under Sec.  1.136(a) of this title for patent  applications are not applicable to the time periods set forth in this  section. See Sec.  1.136(b) of this title for extensions of time to  reply for patent applications and Sec.  1.550(c) of this title for  extensions of time to reply for ex parte reexamination proceedings.
