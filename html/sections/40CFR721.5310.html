                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to  reporting. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The chemical substance identified as neononanoic acid,  ethenyl ester (PMN P-92-129) is subject to reporting under this section  for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this  section. The requirements of this section do not apply once the  substance has been incorporated into a polymer matrix with the level of  residual monomer below 0.1 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iii)</em>, (a)(3), (a)(4),  (a)(5)(iii) (if cartridge service life testing is not available),  (a)(5)(xii) or (a)(5)(xiii) (if data on cartridge service life testing  has been reviewed and approved in writing by EPA), (a)(6)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>,  (a)(6)(ii), (a)(6)(iv), and (a)(6)(v). As an alternative to the  respiratory requirements in this section, manufacturers, importers, and  processors may use the New Chemical Exposure Limits provisions,  including sampling and analytical methods which have previously been  approved by EPA for this substance, found in the 5(e) consent order for  this substance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(I)</em>, (h)(2)(iii)(A), (h)(2)(iii)(B),  (h)(2)(iii)(C), (h)(2)(iii)(E), (h)(2)(iv)(A), (h)(2)(iv)(B) (The  following additional statements shall appear on each MSDS required by  this paragraph: This substance may cause moderate skin irritation. This  substance may cause neurotoxicity. When using this substance, use  respiratory protection, unless workplace airborne concentrations are  maintained at or below an 8-h TWA of 1 ppm.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities. Requirements  as specified in Sec. 721.80(q).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Release to water. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.90  (a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) (where N = 5 ppb). When calculating the  surface water concentrations according to the instructions in Sec.  721.91(a)(4), the statement that the amount of the substance that will  be released will be calculated before the substance enters control  technology does not apply. Instead, if the waste stream containing the  substance will be treated before release, then the amount of the  substance reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by such  treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms  released. No more than 75 percent removal efficiency may be attributed  to such treatment. In addition, when the substance is released in  combination with the substances hexanedioic acid, diethenyl ester,  hexanoic acid, 2-ethyl-, ethenyl ester, and propanoic acid, 2,2- dimethyl-, ethenyl ester, the quotient from the formula referenced in  this section shall not exceed the average of the quotient applicable to  the other substances weighted by the proportion of each substance  present in the total daily amount released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specific requirements. The provisions of subpart A of this part  apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.  The provisions of Sec. 721.185 apply to this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section.  The provisions of Sec. 721.1725(b)(1) apply to this section.  [58 FR 51705, Oct. 4, 1993, as amended at 58 FR 68311, Dec. 27, 1993]</p>
