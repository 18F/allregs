be designed and operated to recover the organic vapors vented to them with an efficiency of 95 percent or greater, or to an exit concentration of 20 parts per million by volume, whichever is less stringent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Enclosed combustion devices shall be designed and operated to reduce the VHAP emissions vented to them with an efficiency of 95 percent or greater, or to an exit concentration of 20 parts per million by volume, on a dry basis, corrected to 3 percent oxygen, whichever is less stringent, or to provide a minimum residence time of 0.50 seconds at a minimum temperature of 760 C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Flares shall used to comply with this subpart shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 60.18.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Owners or operators of control devices that are used to comply with the provisions of this subpart shall monitor these control devices to ensure that they are operated and maintained in conformance with their design.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (i) through (k) of this section, each closed vent system shall be inspected according to the procedures and schedule specified in paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the vapor collection system or closed vent system is constructed of hard-piping, the owner or operator shall comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conduct an initial inspection according to the procedures in Sec. 61.245(b); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conduct annual visual inspections for visible, audible, or olfactory indications of leaks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the vapor collection system or closed vent system is constructed of ductwork, the owner or operator shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conduct an initial inspection according to the procedures in Sec. 61.245(b); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conduct annual inspections according to the procedures in Sec. 61.245(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Leaks, as indicated by an instrument reading greater than 500 parts per million by volume above background or by visual inspections, shall be repaired as soon as practicable except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Repair shall be completed no later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Delay of repair of a closed vent system for which leaks have been detected is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a process unit shutdown, or if the owner or operator determines that emissions resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair.
