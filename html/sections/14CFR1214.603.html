                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The OFK on a particular flight enables NASA, developers of NASA sponsored payloads, NASA's external payload customers, other Federal agencies, researchers, aerospace contractors, and counterpart institutions of friendly foreign countries to utilize mementos as awards and commendations or preserve them in museums or archives. The courtesy is also extended to other organizations outside the aerospace community, such as state and local governments, the academic community, and independent business entities. In the latter case, it

is customary to fly only one item for the requesting organization to be used for display purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitations. In addition to Sec. 1214.602(c) of this part, U.S. national flags will not be flown as mementos except by U.S. Government sponsors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Approval of Contents. At least 60 days prior to the launch of a Space Shuttle flight, an authorized representative of each organization desiring mementos to be carried on the flight in the OFK must submit a letter or request describing the item(s) to be flown and the intended purpose or distribution. Letters should be directed to the cognizant NASA office as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Space Shuttle customers/users of any nature, to the Director of Transportation Services, Code MC, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Foreign organizations/individuals, and Department of Defense organizations/individuals (both other than as a Space Shuttle customer) and other Federal agencies to the Associate Administrator of External Relations, Code X, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546. Upon receipt of all requests, the cognizant offices will review and forward data to the Associate Director, Code AC, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX 77058.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All others (aerospace companies, state and local governments, the academic community, and non-space-related businesses) may send requests directly to the Associate Director, Code AC, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX 77058. In the event OFK requests, on a particular flight, exceed OFK capability, priority consideration may be given to those entities having payloads on that flight. The listing of the proposed OFK contents for each flight is prepared at the Johnson Space Center and forwarded to the Associate Administrator for Space Flight approximately 30 days prior to launch for approval.</p>
