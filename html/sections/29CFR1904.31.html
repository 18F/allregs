You must record on the OSHA 300 Log the recordable injuries and illnesses of all employees on your payroll, whether they are labor, executive, hourly, salary, part-time, seasonal, or migrant workers. You also must record the recordable injuries and illnesses that occur to employees who are not on your payroll if you supervise these employees on a day-to-day basis. If your business is organized as a sole proprietorship or partnership, the owner or partners are not considered employees for recordkeeping purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Implementation-(1) If a self-employed person is injured or becomes ill while doing work at my business, do I need to record the injury or illness?

leased or contract employees that I supervise on a day-to-day basis?
