                            <p class="depth0">When unauthorized assistance has been made to an advanced biofuel  producer under this Program, the Agency reserves the right to collect  from the recipient the sum that is determined to be unauthorized. If the  recipient fails to pay the Agency the unauthorized assistance plus other  sums due under this section, the Agency reserves the right to offset  that amount against Program payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(4)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notification to the producer. Upon determination that  unauthorized assistance has been made to an advanced biofuel producer  under this Program, the Agency will send a demand letter to the  producer. Unless the Agency modifies the original demand, it will remain  in full force and effect. The demand letter will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Specify the amount of unauthorized assistance, including any  accrued interest to be repaid, and the standards for imposing accrued  interest;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> State the amount of penalties and administrative costs to be  paid, the standards for imposing them and the date on which they will  begin to accrue;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide detailed reason(s) why the assistance was determined  to be unauthorized;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> State the amount is immediately due and payable to the Agency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Describe the rights the producer has for seeking review or  appeal of the Agency's determination pursuant to 7 CFR part 11;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Describe the Agency's available remedies regarding enforced  collection, including referral of debt delinquent after due process for  Federal salary, benefit and tax offset under the Department of Treasury  Offset Program; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Provide an opportunity for the producer to meet with the  Agency and to provide to the Agency facts, figures, written records, or  other information that might refute the Agency's determination.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the producer meets with the Agency, the producer will be  given an opportunity to provide information to refute the Agency's  findings.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> When requested by the producer, the Agency may grant additional  time for the producer to assemble documentation. Such extension of time  for payment will be valid only if the Agency documents the extension in  writing and specifies the period in days during which period the payment  obligation created by the demand letter (but not the ongoing accrual of  interest) will be suspended. Interest and other charges will continue to  accrue pursuant to the initial demand letter during any extension period  unless the terms of the demand letter are modified in writing by the  Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment in full. If the producer agrees with the Agency's  determination or will pay the amount in question, the Agency may allow a  reasonable period of time (usually not to exceed 90 days) for the  producer to arrange for repayment. The amount due will be the  unauthorized payments made plus interest accrued beginning on the date  of the demand letter at the interest rate stipulated until the date paid  unless otherwise agreed, in writing, by the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(iii)</em> of this section are met. Loans established under this  paragraph will be at the Treasury interest rate in effect on the date  the financial assistance was provided and that is consistent with the  term length of the promissory note. In all cases, the receivable will be  amortized per a repayment schedule satisfactory to the Agency that has  the producer pay the unauthorized assistance as quickly as possible, but  in no event will the amortization period exceed fifteen (15) years. The  producer will be required to execute a debt instrument to evidence this  receivable, and the best security position practicable in a manner that  will adequately protect the Agency's interest during the repayment  period will be taken as security.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The producer did not provide false information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It would be highly inequitable to require prompt repayment of  the unauthorized assistance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Failure to collect the unauthorized assistance immediately  will not adversely affect the Agency's interests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Appeals. Appeals resulting from the demand letter prescribed in  paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be handled according to the  provisions of Sec. 4288.103. All appeal provisions will be concluded  before proceeding with further actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Offsets. Failure to make payment as determined under paragraph  (a) of this section will be treated by the Agency as a debt that can be  collected by an Administrative offset, unless written agreements to  repay such debt as an alternative to administrative offset is agreed to  between the Agency and the producer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any debtor who wishes to reach a written agreement to repay the  debt as an alternative to administrative offset   must submit a written proposal for repayment of the debt, which must be  received by the Agency within 20 calendar days of the date the notice  was delivered to the debtor. In response, the Agency will notify the  debtor in writing whether the proposed agreement is acceptable. In  exercising its discretion, the Agency will balance the Government's  interest in collecting the debt against fairness to the debtor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the Agency receives a debtor's proposal for a repayment  agreement, the offset is stayed until the debtor is notified as to  whether the initial agreement is acceptable. If a Government payment  will be made before the end of the fiscal year and the review is not yet  completed, payment will be deferred pending resolution of the review.</p>
