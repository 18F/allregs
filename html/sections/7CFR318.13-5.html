                            <p class="depth0">Certain fruits or vegetables may be moved interstate provided that  the fruits or vegetables originate from an area that is free of a  specific pest or pests. In some cases, fruits or vegetables may only be  moved interstate if the area of origin is free of all plant pests that  attack the fruits or vegetables. In other cases, fruits or vegetables  may be moved interstate if the area of origin is free of one or more  plant pests that attack the fruit or vegetable and the risk posed by the  remaining plant pests that attack the fruit or vegetable is mitigated by  other specific phytosanitary measures contained in the regulations in  this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application of standards for pest-free areas. APHIS will make a  determination of an area's pest-free status based on information  provided by the State. The information used to make   this determination will include trapping and surveillance data, survey  protocols, and protocols for actions to be performed upon detection of a  pest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Survey protocols. APHIS must approve the survey protocol used to  determine and maintain pest-free status, as well as protocols for  actions to be performed upon detection of a pest. Pest-free areas are  subject to audit by APHIS to verify their status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of pest freedom. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For an area to be considered  free of a specified pest for the purposes of this subpart, the  Administrator must determine, and announce in a notice published in the  Federal Register for a public comment period of 60 days, that the area  meets the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator will announce his or her decision in a  subsequent Federal Register notice. If appropriate, APHIS will allow  movement of the regulated article from a pest-free area because:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No comments were received on the notice or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The comments on the notice did not affect the overall  conclusions of the notice and the Administrator's determination of risk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Decertification of pest-free areas; reinstatement. If a pest is  detected in an area that is designated as free of that pest, APHIS will  publish in the Federal Register a notice announcing that the pest-free  status of the area in question has been withdrawn and that interstate  movement of host crops for the pest in question is subject to  application of an approved treatment for the pest. If a treatment for  the pest is not available, interstate movement of the host crops would  be prohibited. In order for a decertified pest-free area to be  reinstated, it would have to meet the criteria of paragraphs (a) through  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> General requirements for the interstate movement of regulated  articles from pest-free areas--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Labeling. Each box of fruits or  vegetables that is moved interstate from a pest-free area under this  subpart must be clearly labeled with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the orchard or grove of origin, or the name of the  grower; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name of the municipality and State or territory in which  the fruits or vegetables were produced; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The type and amount of fruits or vegetables the box contains.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compliance agreement. Persons wishing to move fruits or  vegetables from a pest-free area in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands  must enter into a compliance agreement with APHIS in accordance with  Sec. 318.13-3(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Safeguarding. If fruits or vegetables are moved from a pest-free  area into or through an area that is not free of that pest, the fruits  or vegetables must be safeguarded during the time they are present in a  non-pest-free area by being covered with insect-proof mesh screens or  plastic tarpaulins, including while in transit to the packinghouse and  while awaiting packaging. If fruits or vegetables are moved through an  area that is not free of that pest during transit to a port, they must  be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers or be covered by insect- proof mesh or plastic tarpaulins during transit to the port and  subsequent movement into or through the United States. These safeguards  described in this section must remain intact until the fruits or  vegetables reach their final destination.
