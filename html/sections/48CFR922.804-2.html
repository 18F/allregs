                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Construction contracts, including cost-sharing contracts, are  subject to OFCCP orders applicable in particular areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a proposed nonexempt construction contract is within a  geographic area where construction is subject to the provisions of  Federal EEO Bid Conditions, Part I or Part II, the solicitation shall  contain those bid conditions. The contracting officer shall include in  such solicitation a provision that ``the offeror shall adhere to the  affirmative action plan (bid conditions) set forth in this  solicitation.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lists of areas for which OFCCP has designated specific  affirmative action requirements are available through the Procurement  Executive. Contracting officers should assure that this list and copies  of pertinent orders are made available to all concerned DOE offices and  to DOE contractors and construction subcontractors for work to be  performed in the specified geographical areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other nonexempt construction contracts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a proposed  nonexempt construction contract is not in a ``plan area'' and is in the  amount of $10,000 or more, offerors must agree to comply with the Equal  Employment Opportunity clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When proposed nonexempt contracts of $1,000,000 or over are not  in plan areas and have not been designated as high impact, offerors also  must submit to the contracting officer details regarding specific  affirmative action steps to be taken by the offeror in connection with  all work under the contract. Such details shall include estimates of the  percentage of minority group persons expected to be employed in each  craft involved in the performance of the contract work. All  solicitations for construction contracts shall reference the affirmative  action requirements and the offeror's obligation to make good faith  efforts to employ women in craft positions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pursuant to the OFCCP order dated August 30, 1976, agencies  shall develop ``Special Bid Conditions'' for use on high impact projects  in non-plan areas. These special bid conditions will include mandatory  goals and timetables for the utilization of minorities. The Procurement  Executive using the criteria issued by OFCCP will determine those  projects that are ``high impact.'' The contracting officer is  responsible for compliance with policies and procedures contained in the  OFCCP ``Construction Compliance Program Operations Manual.'' Language  for inclusion in solicitations or contracts contained in the manual may  be   modified, provided all of the requirements are retained. The contracting  officer shall develop the goals and timetables and shall confer with the  appropriate OFCCP regional office. The Office of Civil Rights will  provide assistance as necessary, when requested. Special bid conditions  will be submitted by the contracting officer to the appropriate OFCCP  regional office for approval unless otherwise directed by the  Procurement Executive. When special bid conditions are applicable,  adequate presolicitation lead time should be allowed for submission of  the special bid conditions to OFCCP national and regional offices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An attempt to limit in any major respect the equal opportunity  requirements included in an invitation for bids or request for proposals  for a construction contract shall constitute grounds for a determination  that the offeror does not qualify as a responsible offeror and for  rejection of the bid or proposal. In the case of construction  acquisition by DOE prime contractors, this determination shall be made  only with the approval of the DOE contracting officer.
