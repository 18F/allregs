                                Sec. 1.752-6  Partnership assumption of partner's section 358(h)(3)
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and (b), the partner's basis  in the partnership is reduced (but not below the adjusted value of such  interest) by the amount (determined as of the date of the exchange) of  the liability. For purposes of this section, the adjusted value of a  partner's interest in a partnership is the fair market value of that  interest increased by the partner's share of partnership liabilities  under Sec. Sec. 1.752-1 through 1.752-5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section, the exceptions contained in section 358(h)(2)(A)  and (B) apply to this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of  paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example. In 1999, A and B form partnership PRS. A contributes  property with a value and basis of $200, subject to a nonrecourse debt  obligation of $50 and a fixed or contingent obligation of $100 that is  not a liability   to which section 752(a) and (b) applies, in exchange for a 50% interest  in PRS. Assume that, after the contribution, A's share of partnership  liabilities under Sec. Sec. 1.752-1 through 1.752-5 is $25. Also assume  that the $100 liability is not associated with a trade or business  contributed by A to PRS or with assets contributed by A to PRS. After  the contribution, A's basis in PRS is $175 (A's basis in the contributed  land ($200) reduced by the nonrecourse debt assumed by PRS ($50),  increased by A's share of partnership liabilities under Sec. Sec.  1.752-1 through 1.752-5 ($25)). Because A's basis in the PRS interest is  greater than the adjusted value of A's interest, $75 (the fair market  value of A's interest ($50) increased by A's share of partnership  liabilities ($25)), paragraph (a) of this section operates to reduce A's  basis in the PRS interest (but not below the adjusted value of that  interest) by the amount of liabilities described in section 358(h)(3)  (other than liabilities to which section 752(a) and (b) apply) assumed  by PRS. Therefore, A's basis in PRS is reduced to $75.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section applies to  assumptions of liabilities occurring after October 18, 1999, and before  June 24, 2003.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> describes the manner in which the election is made.
