The Secretary's failure to require you to perform any term or provision of your Leverage does not affect the Secretary's right to enforce such term or provision. Similarly, the Secretary's waiver of, or failure to enforce, any term or provision of your Leverage or of any event or condition set forth in Sec. 4290.1810 does not constitute a waiver of any succeeding breach of such term or provision or condition.</p>
