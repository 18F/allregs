                                Sec. 42.15-25  Hatchways closed by portable covers and secured weathertight
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Hatchway coamings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The coamings of hatchways closed by  portable covers secured weathertight by tarpaulins and battening devices  shall be of substantial construction, and their height above the deck  shall be at least as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 23\1/2\ inches if in position 1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 17\1/2\ inches if in position 2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hatchway covers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The width of each bearing surface for  hatchway covers shall be at least 2\1/2\ inches.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where covers are made of wood, the finished thickness shall be  at least 2\3/8\ inches in association with a span of not more than 4.9  feet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where covers are made of mild steel, the strength shall be  calculated with assumed loads not less than 358 pounds per square foot  on hatchways in position 1, and not less than 266 pounds per square foot  on hatchways in position 2, and the product of the maximum stress thus  calculated and the factor 4.25 shall not exceed the minimum ultimate  strength of the material. They shall be so designed as to limit the  deflection to not more than 0.0028 times the span under these loads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The assumed loads on hatchways in position 1 may be reduced to  205 pounds per square foot for vessels of 79 feet in length and shall be  not less than 358 pounds per square foot for vessels of 328 feet in  length. The corresponding loads on hatchways in position 2 may be  reduced to 154 pounds per square foot and 266 pounds per square foot  respectively. In all cases values at intermediate lengths shall be  obtained by linear interpolation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Portable beams. (1) Where portable beams for supporting hatchway  covers are made of mild steel the strength shall be calculated with  assumed loads not less than 358 pounds per square foot on hatchways in  position 1 and not less than 266 pounds per square foot on hatchways in  position 2 and the product of the maximum stress thus calculated and the  factor 5 shall not exceed the minimum ultimate strength of the material.  They shall be so designed as to limit the deflection to not more than  0.0022 times the span under these loads. For vessels of not more than  328 feet in length the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section  are applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pontoon covers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where pontoon covers used in place of  portable beams and covers are made of mild steel the strength shall be  calculated with the assumed loads given in paragraph (b)(3) of this  section, and the product of the maximum stress thus calculated and the  factor 5 shall not exceed the minimum ultimate strength of the material.  They shall be so designed as to limit the deflection to not more than  0.0022 times the span. Mild steel plating forming the tops of covers  shall be not less in thickness than 1 percent of the spacing of  stiffeners or 0.24 inches if that be greater. For vessels of not more  than 328 feet in length the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this  section are applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The strength and stiffness of covers made of materials other  than mild steel shall be equivalent to those of mild steel to the  satisfaction of the assigning authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Carriers or sockets. (1) Carriers or sockets for portable beams  shall be of substantial construction, and shall provide means for the  efficient fitting and securing of the beams. Where rolling   types of beams are use, the arrangements shall ensure that the beams  remain properly in position when the hatchway is closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Cleats. (1) Cleats shall be set to fit the taper of the wedges.  They shall be at least 2\1/2\ inches wide and spaced not more than 23\1/ 2\ inches center to center; the cleats along each side or end shall be  not more than 6 inches from the hatch corners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Battens and wedges. (1) Battens and wedges shall be efficient  and in good condition. Wedges shall be of tough wood or other equivalent  material. They shall have a taper of not more than 1 in 6 and shall be  not less than \1/2\-inch thick at the toes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Tarpaulins. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least two layers of tarpaulin in good  condition shall be provided for each hatchway in positions 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The tarpaulins shall be waterproof and of ample strength. They  shall be of a material of at least a standard weight and quality as  approved by the assigning and issuing authority.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Security of hatchway covers. (1) For all hatchways in position 1  or 2, steel bars or other equivalent means shall be provided in order  efficiently and independently to secure each section of hatchway covers  after the tarpaulins are battened down. Hatchway covers of more than 4.9  feet in length shall be secured by at least two such securing  appliances.
