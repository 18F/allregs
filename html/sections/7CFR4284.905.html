The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  prohibits discrimination in all its programs and activities on the basis  of race, color, national origin, age, disability, and where applicable,  sex, marital status, familial status, parental status, religion, sexual  orientation, genetic information, political beliefs, reprisal, or  because all or part of an individual's income is derived from any public  assistance program. (Not all prohibited bases apply to all programs.)  Persons with disabilities who require alternative means for  communication of program information (Braille, large print, audiotape,  etc.) should contact USDA's TARGET Center at (202) 720-2600 (voice and  TDD). Any applicant that believes it has been discriminated against as a  result of applying for funds under this program should contact: USDA,  Director, Office of Adjudication and Compliance, 1400 Independence  Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250-9410, or call (800) 795-3272 (voice)  or (202) 720-6382 (TDD) for information and instructions regarding the  filing of a Civil Rights complaint.
