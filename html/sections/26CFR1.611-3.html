                                Sec. 1.611-3  Rules applicable to timber.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)(A)</em>. Amounts paid or incurred in connection with the planting  of timber (including planting for Christmas tree purposes) shall be  capitalized and recoverable through depletion allowances. Such amounts  include, for example, expenditures made for the preparation of the  timber site for planting or for natural seeding and the cost of  seedlings. The apportionment of deductions between the several owners of  economic interests in standing timber will be made as provided in  paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.611-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Computation of allowance for depletion of timber for taxable  year. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The depletion of timber takes place at the time timber is cut,  but the amount of depletion allowable with respect to timber that has  been cut may be computed when the quantity of cut timber is first  accurately measured in the process of exploitation. To the extent that  depletion is allowable in a particular taxable year with respect to  timber the products of which are not sold during such year, the  depletion so allowable shall be included as an item of cost in the  closing inventory of such products for such year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The depletion unit of the timber for a given timber account in a  given year shall be the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the basis  provided by section 1012 and adjusted as provided by section 1016, of  the timber on hand at the beginning of the year plus the cost of the  number of units of timber acquired during the year plus proper additions  to capital, by (ii) the total number of units of timber on hand in the  given account at the beginning of the year plus the cost of the number  of units of timber acquired during the year plus the number of units  acquired during the year plus (or minus) the number of units required to  be added (or deducted) by way of correcting the estimate of the number  of units remaining available in the account. The number of units of  timber of a given timber account cut during any taxable year multiplied  by the depletion unit of that timber account applicable to such year  shall be the amount of depletion allowable for the taxable year. Those  taxpayers who keep their accounts on a monthly basis may, at their  option, keep their depletion accounts on such basis, in which case the  amount allowable on account of depletion for a given month will be  determined in the manner outlined herein for a given year. The total  amount of the allowance for depletion in any taxable year shall be the  sum of the amounts allowable for the several timber accounts. For a  description of timber accounts, see paragraphs (c) and (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a taxpayer has elected to treat the cutting of timber as a  sale or exchange of such timber under the provisions of section 631(a),  he shall reduce the timber account containing such timber by an amount  equal to the adjusted depletion basis of such timber. In computing any  further gain or loss on such timber, see paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.631-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timber depletion accounts on books. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Every taxpayer claiming  or expecting to claim a deduction for depletion of timber property shall  keep accurate ledger accounts in which shall be recorded the cost or  other basis provided by section 1012 of the property and land together  with subsequent allowable capital additions in each account and all  other adjustments provided by section 1016 and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In such accounts there shall be set up separately the quantity  of timber, the quantity of land, and the quantity of other resources, if  any, and a proper part of the total cost or value shall be allocated to  each after proper provision for immature timber growth. See paragraph  (d) of this section. The timber accounts shall be credited each year  with the amount of the charges to the depletion accounts computed in  accordance with paragraph (b) of this section or the amount of the  charges to the depletion accounts shall be credited to depletion reserve  accounts. When the sum of the credits for depletion equals the cost or  other basis of the timber property, plus subsequent allowable capital  additions, no further deduction for depletion will be allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Aggregating timber and land for purposes of valuation and  accounting. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With a view to logical and reasonable valuation of  timber, the taxpayer shall include his timber in one or more accounts.  In general, each such account shall include all of the taxpayer's timber  which is located in one block. A block may be an operation unit which  includes all the taxpayer's timber which would logically go to a single  given point of manufacture. In those cases in which the point of  manufacture is at a considerable distance, or in which the logs or other  products will probably be sold in a log or other market, the block may  be a logging unit which includes all of the taxpayer's timber which  would logically be removed by a single logging development. Blocks may  also be established by geographical or political boundaries or by  logical management areas. Timber acquired under cutting contracts should  be carried in separate accounts and shall not constitute part of any  block. In exceptional cases, provided there are good and substantial  reasons, and subject to approval or revision by the district director on  audit, the taxpayer may divide the timber in a given block into two or  more accounts. For example, timber owned on February 28, 1913, and that  purchased subsequently may be kept in separate accounts, or timber owned  on February 28, 1913, and the timber purchased since that date in  several distinct transactions may be kept in several distinct accounts.  Individual tree species or groups of tree species may be carried in  distinct accounts, or special timber products may be carried in distinct  accounts. Blocks may be divided into two or more accounts based on the  character of the timber or its accessibility, or scattered tracts may be  included in separate accounts. If such a division is made, a proper  portion of the total value or cost, as the case may be, shall be  allocated to each account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The timber accounts mentioned in subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph shall not include any part of the value or cost, as the case  may be, of the land. In a manner similar to that prescribed in  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the land in a given block may be  carried in a single land account or may be divided into two or more  accounts on the basis of its character or accessibility. When such a  division is made, a proper portion of the total value or cost, as the  case may be, shall be allocated to each account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The total value or total cost, as the case may be, of land and  timber shall be equitably allocated to the timber and land accounts,  respectively. In cases in which immature timber growth is a factor, a  reasonable portion of the total value or cost shall be allocated to such  immature timber, and when the timber becomes merchantable such value or  cost shall be recoverable through depletion allowances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each of the several land and timber accounts carried on the  books of the taxpayer shall be definitely described as to their location  on the ground either by maps or by legal descriptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For good and substantial reasons satisfactory to the district  director, or as required by the district director on audit, the timber  or the land accounts may be readjusted by dividing individual accounts,  by combining two or more accounts, or by dividing and recombining  accounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination of quantity of timber. Each taxpayer claiming or  expecting to claim a deduction for depletion is required to estimate  with respect to each separate timber account the total units (feet board  measure, log scale, cords, or other units) of timber reasonably known,  or on good evidence believed, to have existed on the ground on March 1,  1913, or on the date of acquisition of the property, whichever date is  applicable in determining the basis for cost depletion. This estimate  shall state as nearly as possible the number of units which would have  been found present by careful estimate made on the specified date with  the object of determining 100 percent of the quantity of timber which  the area covered by the specific account would have produced on that  date if all of the merchantable timber had been cut and utilized in  accordance with the standards of utilization prevailing in that region  at that time. If subsequently during the ownership of the taxpayer  making the return, as the result of the growth of the timber, of changes  in standards of utilization, of losses not otherwise accounted for, of  abandonment of timber, or of operations or development work, it is  ascertained either by the taxpayer or the district director that there  remain on the ground, available for utilization, more or less units of  timber at the close of the taxable year (or at the close of the month if  the taxpayer keeps his depletion accounts on a monthly basis) than  remain in the timber account or accounts on the basis of the original  estimate, then the original estimate (but not the basis for depletion)  shall be revised. The depletion unit shall be changed when such revision  has been made. The annual charge to the depletion account with respect  to the property shall be computed by using such revised unit for the  taxable year for which the revision is made and all subsequent taxable  years until a change in facts requires another revision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Determination of fair market value of timber property. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If  the fair market value of the property at a specified date is the basis  for depletion deductions, such value shall be determined, subject to  approval or revision by the district director upon audit, by the owner  of the property in the light of the most reliable and accurate  information available with reference to the condition of the property as  it existed at that date, regardless of all subsequent changes, such as  changes in surrounding circumstances, and methods of exploitation, in  degree of utilization, etc. Such factors as the following will be given  due consideration:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Character and quality of the timber as determined by species,  age, size, condition, etc.;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The quantity of timber per acre, the total quantity under  consideration, and the location of the timber in question with reference  to other timber;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Accessibility of the timber (location with reference to  distance from a common carrier, the topography and other features of the  ground upon which the timber stands and over which it must be  transported in process of exploitation, the probable cost of  exploitation and the climate and the state of industrial development of  the locality); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The freight rates by common carrier to important markets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The timber in each particular case will be valued on its own  merits and not on the basis of general averages for regions; however,  the value placed upon it, taking into consideration such factors as  those mentioned in this paragraph, will be coistent with that of other  similar timber in the region. The district director will give weight and  consideration to any and all facts and evidence having a bearing on the  market value, such as cost, actual sales and transfers of similar  properties, the margin between the cost of production and the price  realized for timber products, market value of stock or shares,   royalties and rentals, valuation for local or State taxation,  partnership accountings, records of litigation in which the value of the  property has been involved, the amount at which the property may have  been inventoried or appraised in probate or similar proceedings,  disinterested appraisals by approved methods, and other factors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Revaluation of timber property not allowed. No revaluation of a  timber property whose value as of any specific date has been determined  and approved will be made or allowed during the continuance of the  ownership under which the value was so determined and approved, except  in the case of misrepresentation or fraud or gross error as to any facts  known on the date as of which the valuation was made. Revaluation on  account of misrepresentation or fraud or such gross error will be made  only with the written approval of the Commissioner. The depletion unit  shall be revised when such a revaluation of a timber property has been  made and the annual charge to the depletion account with respect to the  property shall be computed by using such revised unit for the taxable  year for which such revision is made and for all subsequent taxable  years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Reporting and recordkeeping requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Taxable years  beginning before January 1, 2002. A taxpayer claiming a deduction for  depletion of timber for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2002,  shall attach to the income tax return of the taxpayer a filled-out Form  T (Timber) for the taxable year covered by the income tax return,  including the following information--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A map where necessary to show clearly timber and land acquired,  timber cut, and timber and land sold;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Description of, cost of, and terms of purchase of timberland or  timber, or cutting rights, including timber or timber rights acquired  under any type of contract;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Profit or loss from sale of land, or timber, or both;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Description of timber with respect to which claim for loss, if  any, is made;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Record of timber cut;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Changes in each timber account as a result of purchase, sale,  cutting, reestimate, or loss;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Changes in improvements accounts as the result of additions to  or deductions from capital and depreciation, and computation of profit  or loss on sale or other disposition of such improvements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Operation data with respect to raw and finished material  handled and inventoried;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Statement as to application of the election under section  631(a) and pertinent information in support of the fair market value  claimed thereunder;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Information with respect to land ownership and capital  investment in timberland; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Any other data which will be helpful in determining the  reasonableness of the depletion or depreciation deductions claimed in  the return.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. A taxpayer  claiming a deduction for depletion of timber on a return filed for a  taxable year beginning after December 31, 2001, shall attach to the  income tax return of the taxpayer a filled-out Form T (Timber) for the  taxable year covered by the income tax return. In addition, the taxpayer  must retain records sufficient to substantiate the right of the taxpayer  to claim the deduction, including a map, where necessary, to show  clearly timber and land acquired, timber cut, and timber and land sold  for as long as their contents may become material in the administration  of any internal revenue law.
