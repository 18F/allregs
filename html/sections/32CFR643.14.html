                            <p class="depth0">Commanders will provide general surveillance over areas made  available for non-Army use and will advise the DE if and when there are  any irregularities. Real estate which is being used for non-military  purposes will be inspected at least once each year by the COE, or by his  representative, to determine whether grantees or occupants are complyng  with the terms of the instruments authorizing use and occupancy, except  with respect to easements and licenses for rights-of-way for roads,  streets, powerlines, pipelines, underground communication lines and  similar facilities. The COE will make compliance inspections for such  easements and licenses at least once during each 5-year period. However,  the DE will check with installation commanders annually to assure that  there are no situations which might need correction prior to the  inspection. The installation commander will make interim inspections of  all real estate being used for non-military purposes as are necessary  for timely observation of the extent of compliance with grant provisions  designed to protect and preserve the real estate for military  requirements, and will furnish the appropriate DE a copy of a written  report of the inspection reflecting findings and recommendations. In  order that the grantee's operations not be unreasonably disrupted, the  annual compliance inspection made by the DE will be coordinated with the  installation commander so that, if feasible, only one inspection will be  made. Where necessary, corrective action in accordance with applicable  regulations will be taken for the enforcement of the terms of the grant  by the responsible officer who granted the use. Overseas commanders are  responsible for inspection of real estate under their jurisdiction and  necessary corrective action.</p>
