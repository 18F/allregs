For purposes of this part, the National Guard is also included in the Armed Forces.</p><p class="depth0">Aviation life support equipment (ALSE) means equipment that protects flight crewmembers and others aboard an aircraft, assisting their safe escape, survival, and recovery during an accident or other emergency.</p><p class="depth0">Aviation Policy Division is a division in the Office of Asset and Transportation Management, Office of Government-wide Policy, GSA. Contact the staff via the Aircraft Management Overview page at http://www.gsa.gov/aviationpolicy.</p><p class="depth0">Crewmember means a person assigned to operate or assist in operating an aircraft during flight time. Crewmembers perform duties directly related to the operation of the aircraft (e.g., as pilots, co-pilots, flight engineers, navigators) or duties assisting in operation of the aircraft (e.g., as flight directors, crew chiefs, electronics technicians, mechanics). See also the terms and definitions for ``Qualified non-crewmember'' and ``Passenger'' in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Criticality code means a single digit code that DOD assigns to military Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Parts (FSCAP) (see Sec. Sec. 102-33.115 and 102-33.370).</p><p class="depth0">Data plate means a fireproof plate that is inscribed with certain information required by 14 CFR part 45 (or for military surplus aircraft, as required

by Military Specifications), and secured to an aircraft, aircraft engine, or propeller. The information must be marked by etching, stamping, engraving, or other approved method of fireproof marking. The plate must be attached in such a manner that it is not likely to be defaced or removed during normal service or lost or destroyed in an accident. Data plates are required only on certificated aircraft. However, non-certificated aircraft may also have data plates.</p><p class="depth0">Declassify means to remove a lost, destroyed, or non-operational aircraft from the Federal aircraft inventory. Agencies may declassify only non-operational aircraft that they will retain for ground use only. Agencies must declassify an aircraft following the rules in Sec. Sec. 102-33.415 and 102-33.420.</p><p class="depth0">Disposal date means the date that the disposing executive agency relinquishes responsibility for an aircraft, for example, when the agency transfers title in the case of an exchange/sale; returns the aircraft to the lessor or bailer; declassifies it (for FAIRS, declassification is considered a ``disposal'' action, even though the agency retains the property); or relinquishes custody to another agency (i.e., in the case of excess (transferred) or surplus (donated or sold) aircraft).</p><p class="depth0">Donated aircraft means an aircraft disposed of as surplus by GSA through donation to a non-Federal government, a tax-exempt nonprofit entity, or other eligible recipient, following the rules in part Sec. 102-37 (some agencies, for example DOD, may have independent donation authority.)</p><p class="depth0">Exchange means to replace personal property by trade or trade-in with the supplier of the replacement property.</p><p class="depth0">Exchange/sale means to exchange or sell non-excess, non-surplus personal property and apply the exchange allowance or proceeds of sale in whole or in part payment for the acquisition of similar property.

The FAS Property Management Division in GSA's Pacific Rim Region, 450 Golden Gate Ave., San Francisco, CA 94102-3434, has responsibility for disposing of excess and surplus aircraft.</p><p class="depth0">Federal aircraft means manned or unmanned aircraft that an executive agency owns (i.e., holds title to) or borrows for any length of time. Federal aircraft include--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Bailed aircraft: Federal aircraft that is owned by one executive agency, but is in the custody of and operated by another executive agency under an agreement that may or may not include cost-reimbursement. Bailments are executive agency to executive agency agreements and involve only aircraft, not services;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Borrowed aircraft: Aircraft owned by a non-executive agency and provided to an executive agency for use without compensation. The executive agency operates and maintains the aircraft;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Forfeited aircraft: Aircraft acquired by the Government either by summary process or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to any law of the United States;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Loaned aircraft: Federal aircraft owned by an executive agency, but in the custody of a non-executive agency under an agreement that does not include compensation; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> Owned aircraft: An aircraft for which title or rights of title are vested in an executive agency.</p><p class="depth0">Note to definition of Federal aircraft:  When an executive agency loans or bails an aircraft that meets the criteria for Federal aircraft, the loaned or bailed aircraft is still considered a Federal aircraft in the owning agency's inventory, except when DOD is the owning agency of a bailed aircraft. In that case, the aircraft is recorded in the inventory of the bailee.</p><p class="depth0">Federal Aviation Interactive Reporting System (FAIRS) is a management information system operated by GSA to collect, maintain, analyze, and report information on Federal aircraft inventories and cost and usage of Federal aircraft and CAS aircraft (and related

services) (see Sec.

Aircraft hired under full service contracts are commercial aviation services (CAS), not Federal aircraft, regardless of the length of the contract.</p><p class="depth0">Government aircraft means manned or unmanned aircraft operated for the exclusive use of an executive agency. Government aircraft include--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Federal aircraft (see definition for ``Federal aircraft'' in this section); and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Aircraft hired as commercial aviation services (CAS). CAS include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Leased aircraft for exclusive use for an agreed upon period of time (The acquiring executive agency operates and maintains the aircraft);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Capital lease aircraft for which the leasing agency holds an option to take title;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Charter aircraft for hire under a contractual agreement for one-time exclusive use that specifies performance (The commercial source operates and maintains a charter aircraft);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> Rental aircraft obtained commercially under an agreement in which the executive agency has exclusive use for an agreed upon period of time (The executive agency operates, but does not maintain, a rental aircraft);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(v)</em> Contracting for full services (i.e., aircraft and related aviation services for exclusive use); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(vi)</em> Obtaining related aviation services (i.e., services but not aircraft) by commercial contract, except those services acquired to support a Federal aircraft.</p><p class="depth0">Governmental function means a Federally-funded activity that an executive agency performs in compliance with its statutory authorities.</p><p class="depth0">Intelligence community means those agencies identified in the National Security Act, 50 U.S.C. 401a(4).</p><p class="depth0">Inter-service support agreement (ISSA) means any agreement between two or more executive agencies (including the Department of Defense) in which one agency consents to perform aviation support services (e.g., providing an aircraft and other aviation services or providing only services) for another agency with or without cost-reimbursement. An executive agency-to-executive agency agreement that involves only the use of an aircraft, not services, is a bailment, not an ISSA.</p><p class="depth0">Life-limited part means any aircraft part that has an established replacement time, inspection interval, or other time-related procedure associated with it. For non-military parts, the FAA specifies life-limited part airworthiness limitations in 14 CFR 21.50, 23.1529, 25.1529, 27.1529, 29.1529, 31.82, 33.4, and 35.5, and on product Type Certificate Data Sheets (TCDS).

This definition refers to the aircraft's flight capability, not its mission-support equipment capability. An aircraft that is temporarily out of service for maintenance or repair and can economically be made safe for flight is considered an operational aircraft.</p><p class="depth0">Official Government business in relation to Government aircraft--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Includes, but is not limited to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Carrying crewmembers, qualified non-crewmembers, and cargo directly required for or associated with performing Governmental functions (including travel-related Governmental functions);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Carrying passengers authorized to travel on Government aircraft (see OMB Circular A-126); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Training pilots and other aviation personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Does not include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Using Government aircraft for personal or political purposes, except for required use travel and space available travel as defined in OMB Circular A-126; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Carrying passengers who are not officially authorized to travel on Government aircraft.</p><p class="depth0">Operational aircraft means a Federal aircraft that is safe for flight or, in the owning executive agency's determination, can economically be made safe for flight. This definition refers to the aircraft's flight capability, not its mission-support capability. An aircraft temporarily out of service for maintenance or repair is considered an operational aircraft.</p><p class="depth0">Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) means the person or company who originally designed, engineered, and manufactured, or who currently holds the data rights to manufacture, a specific aircraft or aircraft part. Parts produced under a Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) are not considered OEM parts, even though they can be acceptable replacement parts for OEM parts.</p><p class="depth0">Passenger means a person flying onboard a Government aircraft who is officially authorized to travel and who is not a crewmember or qualified non-crewmember.</p><p class="depth0">Performance indicator means a quantitative or qualitative term or value for reporting organizational activities and results, generally with respect to achieving specific goals related to outcomes, outputs, efficiency, and inputs.

Foreign-registered aircraft hired as CAS will carry their national registration markings. Registration markings are commonly referred to as tail numbers.</p><p class="depth0">Related aviation services contract means a commercial contractual agreement through which an executive agency hires aviation services only (not aircraft), e.g., pilot, crew, maintenance, cleaning, dispatching, or catering.</p><p class="depth0">Required use travel means use of a Government aircraft for the travel of an executive agency officer or employee where the use of the Government aircraft is required because of bona fide communications or security need of the agency or exceptional scheduling requirements. Required use travel must be approved as described in OMB Circular A-126.</p><p class="depth0">Risk analysis and management means a systematic process for--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Identifying risks and hazards associated with alternative courses of action involved in an aviation operation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Choosing from among these alternatives the course(s) of action that will promote optimum aviation safety;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Assessing the likelihood and predicted severity of an injurious mishap within the various courses of action;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Controlling and mitigating identified risks and hazards within the chosen course(s) of action; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> Periodically reviewing the chosen course(s) of action to identify possible emerging risks and hazards.</p><p class="depth2">Safe for flight means approved for flight and refers to an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, or part

that has been inspected and certified to meet the requirements of applicable regulations, specifications, or standards. When applied to an aircraft that an executive agency operates under FAA regulations, safe for flight means ``airworthy,'' i.e., the aircraft or related parts meet their design specifications and are in a condition, relative to wear and deterioration, for safe operation. When applied to an aircraft that an executive agency uses, but does not operate under the FAA regulations, safe for flight means a state of compliance with military specifications or the executive agency's own Flight Program Standards, and as approved, inspected, and certified by the agency.</p><p class="depth2">Safety Management System (SMS) means a formal, top-down business-like approach to managing safety risk. It includes systematic procedures, practices, and policies for the management of safety, safety risk management, safety policy, safety assurance, and safety promotion.

Non-military parts are traceable if you can establish that the parts were manufactured in accordance with or were previously determined to be airworthy under rules in 14 CFR parts 21 and 43. Possible sources for making a traceability determination could be shipping tickets, bar codes, invoices, parts marking (e.g., PMA, TSO), data plates, serial/part numbers, manufacturing production numbers, maintenance records, work orders, etc.</p><p class="depth2">Training means instruction for all flight program personnel (to include administrative, maintenance and dispatch personnel), which enables them to qualify initially for their positions and to maintain qualification for their positions over time.</p><p class="depth2">Note: This instruction can apply to either public or civil missions as defined in the latest version of the FAA's Advisory Circular for Government aircraft operations.</p><p class="depth2">Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) means an unmanned aircraft and its associated elements related to safe operations, which may include but not be limited to control stations, data communications links, support equipment, payloads, flight termination systems, and launch/recovery equipment. The unmanned aircraft (UA) is the flying component of the system, flown by a pilot via a ground control system, or autonomously through the use of an on-board computer, communication links, and any additional equipment necessary for the unmanned aircraft to operate safely. The Federal Aviation Administration issues either an Airworthiness Directive (AD) or a Certificate of Authorization (COA) for the entire system, not just the flying component of the system. Reporting of UAS costs and flight hours is only required if the accumulated costs for acquisition and operations meets the agency's threshold for capitalization, and the

UAS has a useful life of two years or more.</p><p class="depth2">Unsalvageable aircraft part means an aircraft part that cannot be restored to a condition that is safe for flight because of its age, its physical condition, a non-repairable defect, insufficient documentation, or its non-conformance with applicable standards/specifications.</p><p class="depth2">U.S. Government Aircraft Cost Accounting Guide (CAG) means guidance for the accounting of Government aircraft costs published by GSA and is based on the cost guidance within OMB Circular A-126, OMB Circular A-76, FAIRS, and the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger.</p><p class="depth2">Responsibilities</p>
