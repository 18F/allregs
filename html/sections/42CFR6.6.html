                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Only acts and omissions occurring on and after the effective date of the Secretary's determination under Sec.  6.5 and before the later date specified in section 224(g)(3) of the Act are covered by this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Only claims for damage for personal injury, including death, resulting from the performance of medical, surgical, dental, or related functions are covered by this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> With respect to covered individuals, only acts and omissions within the scope of their employment (or contract for services) are covered. If a covered individual is providing services which are not on behalf of the covered entity, such as on a volunteer basis or on behalf of a third-party (except as described in paragraph (d) of this section), whether for pay or otherwise, acts and omissions which are related to such services are not covered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Only acts and omissions related to the grant-supported activity of entities are covered. Acts and omissions related to services provided to individuals who are not patients of a covered

entity will be covered only if the Secretary determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The provision of the services to such individuals benefits patients of the entity and general populations that could be served by the entity through community-wide intervention efforts within the communities served by such entity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The provision of the services to such individuals facilitates the provision of services to patients of the entity; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Such services are otherwise required to be provided to such individuals under an employment contract or similar arrangement between the entity and the covered individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following are examples of situations within the scope of paragraph (d) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A community health center deemed to be a covered entity establishes a school-based or school-linked health program as part of its grant supported activity. Even though the students treated are not necessarily registered patients of the center, the center and its health care practitioners will be covered for services provided, if the Secretary makes the determination in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A migrant health center requires its physicians to obtain staff privileges at a community hospital. As a condition of obtaining such privileges, and thus being able to admit the center's patients to the hospital, the physicians must agree to provide occasional coverage of the hospital's emergency room. The Secretary would be authorized to determine that this coverage is necessary to facilitate the provision of services to the grantee's patients, and that it would therefore be covered by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A homeless health services grantee makes arrangements with local community providers for after-hours coverage of its patients. The grantee's physicians are required by their employment contracts to provide periodic cross-coverage for patients of these providers, in order to make this arrangement feasible. The Secretary may determine that the arrangement is within the scope of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For the specific activities described in this paragraph (e)(4), when carried out by an entity (and its eligible personnel) that has been covered under paragraph (c) of this section, the Department has determined that coverage is provided under paragraph (d) of this section, without the need for specific application for an additional coverage determination under paragraph (d) of this section, if the activity or arrangement in question fits squarely within these descriptions; otherwise, the health center should seek a particularized determination of coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Community-Wide Interventions. (A) School-Based Clinics: Health center staff provide primary and preventive health care services at a facility located in a school or on school grounds. The health center has a written affiliation agreement with the school.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> School-Linked Clinics: Health center staff provide primary and preventive health care services, at a site not located on school grounds, to students of one or more schools. The health center has a written affiliation agreement with each school.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Health Fairs: On behalf of the health center, health center staff conduct or participate in an event to attract community members for purposes of performing health assessments. Such events may be held in the health center, outside on its grounds, or elsewhere in the community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Immunization Campaigns: On behalf of the health center, health center staff conduct or participate in an event to immunize individuals against infectious illnesses. The event may be held at the health center, schools, or elsewhere in the community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Migrant Camp Outreach: Health center staff travel to a migrant farmworker residence camp to conduct intake screening to determine those in need of clinic services (which may mean health care is provided at the time of such intake activity or during subsequent clinic staff visits to the camp).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Homeless Outreach: Health center staff travel to a shelter for homeless persons, or a street location where homeless persons congregate, to conduct intake screening to determine those in need of clinic services (which

may mean health care is provided at the time of such intake activity or during subsequent clinic staff visits to that location).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Hospital-Related Activities. Periodic hospital call or hospital emergency room coverage is required by the hospital as a condition for obtaining hospital admitting privileges. There must also be documentation for the particular health care provider that this coverage is a condition of employment at the health center.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Coverage-Related Activities. As part of a health center's arrangement with local community providers for after-hours coverage of its patients, the health center's providers are required by their employment contract to provide periodic or occasional cross-coverage for patients of these providers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Coverage in Certain Individual Emergencies. A health center provider is providing or undertaking to provide covered services to a health center patient within the approved scope of project of the center, or to an individual who is not a patient of the health center under the conditions set forth in this rule, when the provider is then asked, called upon, or undertakes, at or near that location and as the result of a non-health center patient's emergency situation, to temporarily treat or assist in treating that non-health center patient. In addition to any other documentation required for the original services, the health center must have documentation (such as employee manual provisions, health center bylaws, or an employee contract) that the provision of individual emergency treatment, when the practitioner is already providing or undertaking to provide covered services, is a condition of employment at the health center.
