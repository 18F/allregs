                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Yes, an owner or operator of an affected municipal waste  combustion unit may choose to reduce, by your   final compliance date, the maximum combustion capacity of the unit to  less than 35 tons per day of municipal solid waste rather than comply  with your State plan. They must submit a final control plan and the  notifications of achievement of increments of progress as specified in  Sec. 60.1610.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The final control plan must, at a minimum, include two items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the physical changes that will be made to  accomplish the reduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculations of the current maximum combustion capacity and the  planned maximum combustion capacity after the reduction. Use the  equations specified under Sec. 60.1935(d) and (e) to calculate the  combustion capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A permit restriction or a change in the method of operation does  not qualify as a reduction in capacity. Use the equations specified  under Sec. 60.1935(d) and (e) to calculate the combustion capacity of a  municipal waste combustion unit.</p>
