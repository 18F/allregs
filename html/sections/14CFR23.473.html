Sec. 23.479, 23.481, and 23.483 may be complied with at a design landing weight (the highest weight for landing conditions at the maximum descent velocity) allowed under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The design landing weight may be as low as--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 95 percent of the maximum weight if the minimum fuel capacity is enough for at least one-half hour of operation at maximum continuous power plus a capacity equal to a fuel weight which is the difference between the design maximum weight and the design landing weight; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The design maximum weight less the weight of 25 percent of the total fuel capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The design landing weight of a multiengine airplane may be less than that allowed under paragraph (b) of this section if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The airplane meets the one-engine-inoperative climb requirements of Sec. 23.67(b)(1) or (c); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compliance is shown with the fuel jettisoning system requirements of Sec. 23.1001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The selected limit vertical inertia load factor at the center of gravity of the airplane for the ground load conditions prescribed in this subpart may not be less than that which would be obtained when landing with a descent velocity (V), in feet per second, equal to 4.4 (W/S)\1/4\, except that this velocity need not be more than 10 feet per second and may not be less than seven feet per second.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Wing lift not exceeding two-thirds of the weight of the airplane may be assumed to exist throughout the landing impact and to act through the center of gravity.
