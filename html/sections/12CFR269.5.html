                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Once there has been a final determination of the existence of an  appropriate bargaining unit under the procedure in Sec. 269.4, and a  showing by a labor organization that it has cards signed by at least  thirty percent (30%) of the employees in such unit requesting a  representation election, an election shall be ordered by the Special  Tribunal. A labor organization shall be recognized as the exclusive  bargaining representative of the unit if it is selected by a majority of  the employees in the unit actually voting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The election shall be held under the auspices of the Association  and shall be subject to its election rules and regulations. However, if  there should be any conflict between such rules and regulations and the  provisions of this Policy, the latter shall   prevail. The fees charged by the Association for its election service  shall be borne equally by the labor organization and the Bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An election to determine whether a labor organization should  continue as the exclusive bargaining representative of a particular unit  shall be held when requested by a petition or other bona fide showing by  at least thirty percent (30%) of the employees of that unit. Any dispute  as to whether thirty percent (30%) of the employees requested such an  election shall be resolved by the same procedure as that set forth in  Sec. 269.4(b). The election shall be held under the auspices of the  Association in the same manner described in paragraph (b) of this  section. The recognition of a labor organization as the exclusive  bargaining representative of a unit shall be revoked if a majority of  the employees in the unit who actually vote signify approval of such  revocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Only one election may be held in any unit in a twelve (12) month  period to determine whether a labor organization should become, or  continue to be recognized as, the exclusive representative of the  employees in that unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon receipt of a request for an election from a labor  organization under Sec. 269.4(a), it shall be incumbent on the Bank,  labor organization and all others to refrain from any conduct, action or  policy that interferes with or restrains employees from making a fair  and free choice in selecting or rejecting a bargaining representative  consistent with the right of the Bank, labor organization or employees  to exercise privileges of free speech in the expression of any views,  argument or opinion, or the dissemination thereof, whether in oral,  written, printed, graphic or visual form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Special Tribunal shall hear and decide any post-election  objections of a Bank or labor organization filed with it claiming that a  violation of paragraph (e) of this section has improperly affected the  outcome of the election. Such objections must be filed with the Special  Tribunal no later than five (5) business days after the date of  election. In the event of such violation by a Bank, labor organization  or other individuals or organizations which the Special Tribunal finds  sufficient to have prejudiced the outcome of an election, appropriate  remedial action shall be taken in the form of setting aside the election  results and ordering a new election, provided, however, that an appeal  from the order of the Special Tribunal may be taken within thirty (30)  calendar days to the Federal Reserve System Labor Relations Panel by  either the affected Bank or labor organization. The ruling of the System  Panel shall be final and binding. Neither the Special Tribunal nor the  Federal Reserve System Labor Relations Panel shall have the authority to  direct a Bank to recognize a labor organization as the exclusive  collective bargaining representative without a valid election being held  in which a majority of the employees actually voting have so designated  such labor organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Special Tribunal and the Federal Reserve System Labor  Relations Panel will adhere to any rules and regulations promulgated by  the Board of Governors for the administration of the provisions of  paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.</p>
