                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Loans are to be repaid according to their terms. RUS generally  obtains a first lien on all assets of the borrower. This lien shall be  in the form of a mortgage by the borrower to the Government or a deed of  trust made by and between the borrower and a trustee, satisfactory to  the Administrator, together with such security agreements, financing  statements, or other security documents as RUS may deem necessary in a  particular case. Where a borrower is unable by reason of pre-existing  encumbrances, or otherwise, to furnish a first mortgage lien on its  entire system the Administrator may, if   he determines such security to be reasonably adequate and the form and  nature thereof otherwise appropriate, accept other forms of security.  See RUS Bulletins 320-4, 320-22, 321-2, 322-2, 323-1, and 326-1 for  details. See 7 CFR part 1744, subpart B for information on lien  accommodations and subordinations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loan security documents of borrowers with loans approved after  October 6, 1997 will provide limits on allowable cash distributions in  any calendar year as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No more than 25 percent of the prior calendar year's net  earnings or margins if the borrower's net worth is at least 1 percent of  its total assets after the distribution is made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No more than 50 percent of the prior calendar year's net  earnings or margins if the borrower's net worth is at least 20 percent  of its total assets after the distribution is made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No more than 75 percent of the prior calendar year's net  earnings or margins if the borrower's net worth is at least 30 percent  of its total assets after the distribution is made; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No limit on distributions if the borrower's net worth is at  least 40 percent of its total assets after the distribution is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Borrowers that have not received a loan after October 6, 1997  may request the Administrator to apply these requirements to them.  Borrowers may request in writing that RUS substitute the new  requirements described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this  section. Upon request by the borrower, the provisions of the borrower's  loan documents restricting cash distributions or investments shall not  be enforced to the extent that such provisions are inconsistent with  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rural development investments meeting the criteria set forth in  7 CFR part 1744, subpart D, will not be counted against a borrower's  allowable cash distributions in any calendar year (7 U.S.C. 926).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> References to a borrower's mortgage in this section include  deeds of trust and any other loan document applying the same  requirements to a borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> This section does not limit the rights of any parties to the  mortgage other than RUS or RTB.
