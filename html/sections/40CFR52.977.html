                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination of Attainment. Effective March 12, 2010 EPA has determined the Baton Rouge 1-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Under the provisions of EPA's Clean Data Policy, this determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit a severe attainment demonstration, a severe reasonable further progress plan, applicable contingency measures plans, and other planning Louisiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements related to attainment of the 1-hour ozone NAAQS for so long as the area continues to attain the 1-hour ozone NAAQS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of Attainment. Effective October 12, 2010 EPA has determined that the Baton Rouge 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Under the provisions of 40 CFR 51.918 this determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, a reasonable further progress plan, applicable contingency measures, and other planning Louisiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements related to attainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS for so long as the area continues to attain the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination to Terminate the Clean Air Act Section 185 Penalty Fee Requirement. Effective September 6, 2011 EPA has determined that the

State of Louisiana is no longer required to submit a section 185 fee program State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision for the Baton Rouge ozone nonattainment area to satisfy anti-backsliding requirements for the 1-hour ozone standard. This determination is based on EPA's determination that the area has attained the 1-hour ozone standard due to permanent and enforceable emissions reductions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Redesignation for the 1997 8-hour Ozone Standard. Effective December 30, 2011, EPA has redesignated the Baton Rouge area to attainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. With this final redesignation to attainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and the final determination of attainment for the 1-hour ozone NAAQS in paragraph (a) of this section, the 1-hour anti-backsliding obligations to submit planning SIPs to meet the attainment demonstration and reasonably available control measures requirements, the rate of progress and contingency measures requirements, and any other outstanding 1-hour requirements, cease to apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Clean Data Determination. Effective June 16, 2014 EPA has determined that the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, marginal 2008 8-hour ozone nonattainment area is currently attaining the 2008 8-hour NAAQS for ozone.
