The Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright subsisting in technical data and computer software first produced by the Contractor in performance of this Contract, where the Contractor can show that commercialization would be enhanced by such copyright protection, subject to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contractor Request to Assert Copyright.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For data other than scientific and technical articles and data produced under a CRADA, the Contractor shall submit in writing to Patent Counsel its request to assert copyright in data first produced in the performance of this Contract pursuant to this clause. The right of the Contractor to copyright data first produced under a CRADA is

as described in the individual CRADA. Each request by the Contractor must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The identity of the data (including any computer program) for which the Contractor requests permission to assert copyright, as well as an abstract which is descriptive of the data and is suitable for dissemination purposes, (B) The program under which it was funded, (C) Whether, to the best knowledge of the Contractor, the data is subject to an international treaty or agreement, (D) Whether the data is subject to export control, (E) A statement that the Contractor plans to commercialize the data in compliance with the clause of this contract entitled, ``Technology Transfer Mission,'' within five (5) years after obtaining permission to assert copyright or, on a case-by-case basis, a specified longer period where the Contractor can demonstrate that the ability to commercialize effectively is dependent upon such longer period, and (F) For data other than computer software, a statement explaining why the assertion of copyright is necessary to enhance commercialization and is consistent with DOE's dissemination responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For data that is developed using other funding sources in addition to DOE funding, the permission to assert copyright in accordance with this clause must also be obtained by the Contractor from all other funding sources prior to the Contractor's request to Patent Counsel. The request shall include the Contractor's certification or other documentation acceptable to Patent Counsel demonstrating such permission has been obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Permission for the Contractor to assert copyright in excepted categories of data as determined by DOE will be expressly withheld. Such excepted categories include data whose release (A) would be detrimental to national security, i.e., involve classified information or data or sensitive information under Section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or are subject to export control for nonproliferation and other nuclear-related national security purposes, (B) would not enhance the appropriate transfer or dissemination and commercialization of such data, (C) would have a negative impact on U.S. industrial competitiveness, (D) would prevent DOE from meeting its obligations under treaties and international agreements, or (E) would be detrimental to one or more of DOE's programs. Additional excepted categories may be added by the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property. Where data are determined to be under export control restriction, the Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright subject to the provisions of this clause for purposes of limited commercialization in a manner that complies with export control statutes and applicable regulations. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, all data developed with Naval Reactors' funding and those data that are classified fall within excepted categories. The rights of the Contractor in data are subject to the disposition of data rights in the treaties and international agreements identified under this Contract as well as those additional treaties and international agreements which DOE may from time to time identify by unilateral amendment to the Contract; such amendment listing added treaties and international agreements is effective only for data which is developed after the date such treaty or international agreement is added to this Contract. Also, the Contractor will not be permitted to assert copyright in data in the form of various technical reports generated by the Contractor under the Contract without first obtaining the advanced written permission of the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> DOE Review and Response to Contractor's Request. The Patent Counsel shall use its best efforts to respond in writing within 90 days of receipt of a complete request by the Contractor to assert copyright in technical data and computer software pursuant to this clause. Such response shall either give or withhold DOE's permission for the Contractor to assert copyright or advise the Contractor that DOE needs additional time to respond, and the reasons therefor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Permission for Contractor to Assert Copyright.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For computer software, the Contractor shall furnish to the DOE designated, centralized software distribution and control point, the Energy Science and Technology Software Center, at the time permission to assert copyright is given under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause: (A) An abstract describing the software suitable for publication, (B) the source code for each software program, and (C) the object code and at least the minimum support documentation needed by a technically competent user to understand and use the software. The Patent Counsel, for good cause shown by the Contractor, may allow the minimum support documentation to be delivered within 60 days after permission to assert copyright is given or at such time the minimum support documentation becomes available. The Contractor acknowledges that the DOE designated software distribution and control point may provide a technical description of the software in an announcement identifying its availability from the copyright holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, for data other than computer software to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause above, the Contractor shall within sixty (60) days of obtaining such permission furnish to DOE's

Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) a copy of such data as well as an abstract of the data suitable for dissemination purposes. The Contractor acknowledges that OSTI may provide an abstract of the data in an announcement to DOE, its contractors and to the public identifying its availability from the copyright holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For a five year period or such other specified period as specifically approved by Patent Counsel beginning on the date the Contractor is given permission to assert copyright in data, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. Upon request, the initial period may be extended after DOE approval. The DOE approval will be based on the standard that the work is still commercially available and the market demand is being met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> After the period approved by Patent Counsel for application of the limited Government license described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this clause, or if, prior to the end of such period(s), the Contractor abandons commercialization activities pertaining to the data to which the Contractor has been given permission to assert copyright, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, distribute copies to the public, prepare derivative works, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Whenever the Contractor asserts copyright in data pursuant to this paragraph (e), the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 on the copyrighted data and also an acknowledgment of the Government sponsorship and license rights of paragraphs (e)(3) (iii) and (iv) of this clause. Such action shall be taken when the data are delivered to the Government, published, licensed or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. The acknowledgment of Government sponsorship and license rights shall be as follows: Notice: These data were produced by (insert name of Contractor) under Contract No. -------------- with the Department of Energy.

There is provision for the possible extension of the term of this license. Subsequent to that period or any extension granted, the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so. The specific term of the license can be identified by inquiry made to Contractor or DOE. Neither the United States nor the United States Department of Energy, nor any of their employees, makes any warranty, express or implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any data , apparatus, product, or process disclosed, or represents that its use would not infringe privately owned rights.</p><p class="depth0">(End of notice)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> With respect to any data to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright, the DOE has the right, during the five (5) year or specified longer period approved by Patent Counsel as provided for in paragraph (e) of this clause, to request the Contractor to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant(s) upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Contractor refuses such request, to grant such license itself, if the DOE determines that the Contractor has not made a satisfactory demonstration that either it or its licensee(s) is actively pursuing commercialization of the data as set forth in subparagraph (e)(1)(A) of this clause. Before licensing under this subparagraph (vi), DOE shall furnish the Contractor a written request for the Contractor to grant the stated license, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days (or such longer period as may be authorized by the contracting officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor) after such notice to show cause why the license should not be granted. The Contractor shall have the right to appeal the decision of the DOE to grant the stated license to the Invention Licensing Appeal Board as set forth in 10 CFR 781.65--''Appeals.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> No costs shall be allowable for maintenance of copyrighted data, primarily for the benefit of the Contractor and/or a licensee which exceeds DOE Program needs, except as expressly provided in writing by the contracting officer. The Contractor may use its net royalty income to effect such maintenance costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> At any time the Contractor abandons commercialization activities for data for which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright in accordance with this clause, it shall advise OSTI and Patent Counsel and upon request assign the copyright to the Government so that the Government can distribute the data to the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The following notice may be placed on computer software prior to any publication

and prior to the Contractor's obtaining permission from the Department of Energy to assert copyright in the computer software pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Notice: This computer software was prepared by [insert the Contractor's name and the individual author], hereinafter the Contractor, under Contract [insert the Contract Number] with the Department of Energy (DOE).
