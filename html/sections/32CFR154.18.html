                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. DoD Directive 5200.8 \1\ outlines the authority of  military commanders under the Internal Security Act of 1950 to issue  orders and regulations for the protection of property or places under  their command. Essential to carrying out this responsibility is a  commander's need to protect the command against the action of  untrustworthy persons. Normally, the investigative requirements  prescribed in this part should suffice to enable a commander to  determine the trustworthiness of individuals whose duties require access  to classified information or appointment to positions that are sensitive  and do not involve such access. However, there are certain categories of  positions or duties which, although not requiring access to classified  information, if performed by untrustworthy persons, could enable them to  jeopardize the security of the command or otherwise endanger the  national security. The investigative requirements for such positions or  duties are detailed in this section. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 154.2(c). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Access to restricted areas, sensitive information or equipment  not involving access to classified information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Access to restricted  areas, sensitive information or equipment by DoD military, civilian or  contractor personnel shall be limited to those individuals who have been  determined trustworthy as a result of the favorable completion of a NAC  (or ENTNAC) or who are under the escort of appropriately cleared  personnel. Where escorting such persons is not feasible, a NAC shall be  conducted and favorably reviewed by the appropriate component agency or  activity prior to permitting such access. DoD Components shall not  request, and   shall not direct or permit their contractors to request, security  clearances to permit access to areas when access to classified  information is not required in the normal course of duties or which  should be precluded by appropriate security measures. In determining  trustworthiness under this paragraph, the provisions of Sec. 154.7 and  appendix H will be utilized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In meeting the requirements of this paragraph, approval shall be  obtained from one of the authorities designated in paragraph A, appendix  E of this part, for authority to request NACs on DoD military, civilian  or contractor employees. A justification shall accompany each request  which shall detail the reasons why escorted access would not better  serve the national security. Requests for investigative requirements  beyond a NAC shall be forwarded to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense  for Policy for approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NAC requests shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be forwarded to DIS in accordance with the provisions of  paragraph B, appendix C,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contain a reference to this paragraph on the DD Form 398-2, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> List the authority in appendix E who approved the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determinations to deny access under the provisions of this  paragraph must not be exercised in an arbitrary, capricious, or  discriminatory manner and shall be the responsibility of the military or  installation commander as provided for in DoD Directive 5200.8.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonappropriated fund employees. Each Nonappropriated Fund  employee who is employed in a position of trust as designated by an  official authorized in paragraph H, appendix E, shall have been the  subject of a NAC completed no longer than 12 months prior to employment  or a prior personnel security investigation with no break in Federal  service or employment greater than 12 months in accordance with DoD  Manual 1401.1-M. An individual who does not meet established suitability  requirements may not be employed without prior approval of the  authorizing official. Issuance of a Confidential or Secret clearance  will be based on a DNACI or NACI in accordance with Sec. 154.16(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Customs inspectors. DoD employees appointed as customs  inspectors, under waivers approved in accordance with DoD 5030.49-R  shall have undergone a favorably adjudicated NAC completed within the  past 5 years unless there has been a break in DoD employment greater  than 1 year in which case a current NAC is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Red Cross/United Service Organizations personnel. A favorably  adjudicated NAC shall be accomplished on Red Cross or United Service  Organizations personnel as prerequisite for assignment with the Armed  Forces overseas (32 CFR part 253).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Officials authorized to issue security clearances. Any person  authorized to adjudicate personnel security clearances shall have been  the subject of a favorably adjudicated BI.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Personnel security clearance adjudication officials.

Conduct of a BI for this purpose is prohibited unless approved in  advance by ODUSD(P). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 154.2(c). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Foreign national employees overseas not requiring access to  classified information. Foreign nationals employed by DoD organizations  overseas, whose duties do not require access to classified information,  shall be the subject of the following record checks, initiated by the  appropriate military department investigative organization consistent  with Sec. 154.9(e) prior to employment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Host government law enforcement and security agency checks at  the city, state (province), and national level, whenever permissible by  the laws of the host government; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DCII.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FBI-HQ/ID.

Personnel whose  duties involve access to or security of chemical agents shall be  screened initially for suitability and reliability and shall be  evaluated on a continuing basis at the supervisory level to ensure that  they continue to meet the high standards required. At a minimum, all  such personnel shall have had a favorably adjudicated NAC completed  within the last 5 years prior to assignment in accordance with the  provisions of DoD Directive 5210.65.\1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 154.2(c). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Education and orientation personnel.

Requests for approval to conduct an investigation on  other personnel, not provided for in Sec. 154.18 (b) through (o)  considered to fall within the general provisions of Sec. 154.18(a) shall  be submitted, detailing the justification therefor, for approval to the  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Approval of such requests  shall be contingent upon an assurance that appropriate review procedures  exist and that adverse determinations will be made at no lower than  major command level.</p>
