                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The procedure for billing and payment of standard TDRSS services  is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NASA shall be reimbursed by customers in connection with the use  of Government property and services provided under an approved  reimbursable agreement. Advance payment for services is required.  Advance payments shall be scheduled to keep pace with the rate at which  NASA anticipates incurring costs. NASA will provide a Customer Budget/ Estimate (CBE) for services rendered nominally 60-90 days in advance, or  as otherwise agreed, of the first anticipated property use or required  service date for each mission. The full cost of the mission shall be  paid by the customer not later than 30 days prior to the first  anticipated property use or required service date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In some cases, an advance partial payment will be required six-- nine months prior to the first anticipated property use or required  service date in order for advance planning work and/or travel to take  place. The amount of this partial payment and its receipt shall be  negotiated on an as-needed basis. Adjustments to the amounts prepaid  will be made to the succeeding billings as the actual services are  rendered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the customer fails to make payment by the payment due date,  NASA may terminate the agreement and any subagreements for breach of  agreement after notice to the customer is given of this breach and  failure to cure such breach within a time period established by NASA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Late payments by the user will require the user to pay a late  payment charge.
