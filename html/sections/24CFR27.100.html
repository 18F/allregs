The purpose of this subpart is to implement requirements for the administration of the Single Family Mortgage Foreclosure Act of 1994 (the Statute), 12 U.S.C. 3751-3768, that clarify, or are in addition to, the requirements contained in the Statute, which are not republished here and must be consulted in conjunction with the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. The Secretary may foreclose on any defaulted single family mortgage described in the Statute regardless of when the mortgage was executed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicability. The Secretary may, at the Secretary's option, use other procedures to foreclose defaulted single family mortgages, including judicial foreclosure in State or Federal Court, and nonjudicial foreclosures under State law or any other Federal law. This subpart applies only to foreclosure procedures authorized by the Statute and not to any other foreclosure procedures the Secretary may use.</p>
