                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use the procedures detailed in this subpart to measure vehicle emissions over a specified drive schedule. Different procedures may apply for criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions as described in the standard-

setting part. This subpart describes how to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine road-load power, test weight, and inertia class.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prepare the vehicle, equipment, and measurement instruments for an emission test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Perform pre-test procedures to verify proper operation of certain equipment and analyzers and to prepare them for testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Record pre-test data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Sample emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Record post-test data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Perform post-test procedures to verify proper operation of certain equipment and analyzers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Weigh PM samples.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The overall test generally consists of prescribed sequences of fueling, parking, and driving at specified test conditions. An exhaust emission test generally consists of measuring emissions and other parameters while a vehicle follows the drive schedules specified in the standard-setting part. There are two general types of test cycles:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transient cycles. Transient test cycles are typically specified in the standard-setting part as a second-by-second sequence of vehicle speed commands. Operate a vehicle over a transient cycle such that the speed follows the target values. Proportionally sample emissions and other parameters and calculate emission rates as specified in subpart G of this part to calculate emissions. The standard-setting part may specify three types of transient testing based on the approach to starting the measurement, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A cold-start transient cycle where you start to measure emissions just before starting an engine that has not been warmed up.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A hot-start transient cycle where you start to measure emissions just before starting a warmed-up engine.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A hot-running transient cycle where you start to measure emissions after an engine is started, warmed up, and running.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cruise cycles. Cruise test cycles are typically specified in the standard-setting part as a discrete operating point that has a single speed command.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Start a cruise cycle as a hot-running test, where you start to measure emissions after the engine is started and warmed up and the vehicle is running at the target test speed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sample emissions and other parameters for the cruise cycle in the same manner as a transient cycle, with the exception that the reference speed value is constant. Record instantaneous and mean speed values over the cycle.</p>
