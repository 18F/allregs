                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Electronic Export Information (EEI) collected and accessed  by the Census Bureau under 15 CFR Part 30 is confidential, to be used  solely for official purposes as authorized by the Secretary of Commerce.  The collection of EEI by the Department of Commerce has been approved by  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The information collected is  used by the Census Bureau for statistical purposes. In addition, EEI is  used by federal government agencies, such as the Department of State,  Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection  (CBP) for export control; by other federal government agencies such as  the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Bureau  of Transportation Statistics for statistical purposes; and by other  federal agencies as authorized by the Secretary of Commerce or the  Census Bureau Director consistent with the agencies' statutory or legal  authorities as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section. Absent  such authorization, information collected pursuant to this Part shall  not be disclosed to anyone by any officer, employee, contractor, agent  of the federal government or other parties with access to the EEI other  than to the USPPI or the authorized agent of the USPPI. Such disclosure  shall be limited to that information provided by each party pursuant to  this Part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Viewing and using EEI for official purposes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The EEI may be  viewed and used by federal agencies authorized to use export data for  official purposes as defined to include, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Improving compliance with U.S. export laws and regulations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Detecting and preventing violations of export, census, customs,  homeland security, national resource and other laws, regulations and  treaties;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Analysis to assess threats to U.S. and international security  such as money laundering, and other potential violations of U.S. and  foreign criminal laws;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Enforcement of U.S. export-related laws and regulations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Investigation and prosecution of possible violations of U.S.  export-related laws and regulations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Proof of export for enforcement of laws relating to exemption  from or refund, drawback or other return of taxes, duties, fees or other  charges;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Analyzing the impact of proposed and implemented trade  agreeements and fulfilling U.S. obligations under such agreements; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Preparation of statistics.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Census Bureau may provide the EEI to the USPPI or authorized  agent, for compliance and audit purposes. Such disclosure shall be  limited to that information provided to the AES by the USPPI or the  authorized agent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Supplying EEI for nonofficial purposes. The official report of  the EEI submitted to the U.S. government shall not be disclosed by the  USPPI, the authorized agent, or representative of the   USPPI for ``nonofficial purposes,'' either in whole or in part, or in  any form including but not limited to electronic transmission, paper  printout, or certified reproduction. ``Nonofficial purposes'' are  defined to include but not limited to providing the official EEI:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(vi)</em> of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for purposes not related to  export control or compliance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To state and local government agencies, and nongovernmental  entities or individuals for any purpose; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To foreign entities or foreign governments for any purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ocean manifest data can be made public under provision of CBP  regulations. For information appearing on the outward manifest, 19 CFR  103.31 allows a shipper (or their authorized employee or official) to  submit a certification for confidential treatment of the shipper's name  and address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination by the Secretary of Commerce. Under 13 U.S.C.  301(g), the EEI collected and accessed by the Census Bureau is exempt  from public disclosure unless the Secretary or delegate determines that  such exemption would be contrary to the national interest. The Secretary  or delegate may make such information available, if he or she determines  it is in the national interest, taking such safeguards and precautions  to limit dissemination as deemed appropriate under the circumstances. In  determining whether it is contrary to the national interest to apply the  exemption, the maintenance of confidentiality and national security  shall be considered as important elements of national interest. The  unauthorized disclosure of confidential EEI granted under a National  Interest Determination renders such persons subject to the civil  penalties provided for in Subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Penalties. Disclosure of confidential EEI by any officer,  employee, contractor, or agent of the federal government, except as  provided for in paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section renders such  persons subject to the civil penalties.
