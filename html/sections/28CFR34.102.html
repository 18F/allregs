                            <p class="depth0">The OJJDP peer review process is contained in an OJJDP ``Peer Review Guideline,'' developed in consultation with the Directors and other appropriate officials of the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Mental Health. In addition to specifying substantive and procedural matters related to the peer review process, the ``Guideline'' addresses such issues as standards of conduct, conflict of interest, compensation of peer reviewers, etc. The ``Guideline'' describes a process that evolves in accordance with experience and opportunities to effect improvements. The peer review process for all part C--National Programs assistance awards subject to this regulation will be conducted in a manner consistent with this subpart as implemented in the ``Peer Review Guideline''.</p>
