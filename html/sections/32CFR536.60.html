                            <p class="depth0">Normally, a claim will include all damages that accrue by reason of  the incident. Where a claimant has a claim for property damage and  personal injury arising from the same incident, the property damage  claim may be paid, under certain circumstances, prior to the filing of  the personal injury claim. The personal injury claim may be filed later  provided it is filed within the applicable statute of limitations. When  both property damage and personal injury arise from the same incident,  the property damage claim may be paid to either the claimant or, under  subparts D or H of this part, the insurer and the same claimant may  receive a subsequent payment for personal injury. Only under subparts D  or H of this part may the insurer receive subsequent payment for  subrogated medical bills and lost earnings when the personal injury  claim is settled. The primary purpose of settling an injured claimant's  property damage claim before settling the personal injury claim is to  pay the claimant for vehicle damage expeditiously and avoid costs  associated with delay such as loss of use, loss of business, or storage  charges. The Commander USARCS' approval must be obtained whenever the  estimated value of any one claim exceeds $25,000, or the value of all  claims, actual or potential, arising from the incident exceeds $50,000;  however, if the   claim arises under the FTCA or AMCSA, only if the amount claimed exceeds  $50,000, or $100,000 per incident.</p>
