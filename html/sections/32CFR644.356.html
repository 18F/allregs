legal comments or opinions as may be contained in the file concerning the manner in which and the extent to which such right, title or interest may have been affected). In the absence of any such action, thing or circumstance, a statement to that effect shall be made a part of the report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The status of legislative civil and criminal jurisdiction over the land peculiar to the property by reason of it being Government-owned land.
