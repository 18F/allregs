                                Sec. 783.38  Statutory definition of ``American vessel''.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of section 6(b)(2) prescribe special methods for  computing minimum wages and hours worked under the Act which are  applicable only to seamen who are employed on American vessels. An  ``American vessel'', which would appear to signify a vessel of the  United States as distinguished from a foreign vessel, ``includes'',  under the terms of the definition in section 3(p) of the Act, ``any  vessel which is documented or numbered under the laws of the United  States.'' The Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Customs and the  United States Coast Guard, respectively, are responsible for  documentation and numbering of vessels.    Sec. 783.39  ``Vessel'' includes all means of water transportation.</p><p class="depth0">Since the Act does not define ``vessel'' it is appropriate to apply  the difinition of ``vessel'' as set forth in the United States Code (1  U.S.C. 3). The Code defines ``vessel'' as including ``every description  of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being  used, as a means of transportation on water''. But the Federal Boating  Act of 1958, (under which the U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for  numbering vessels) and the Documentation Regulations administered by the  Bureau of Customs, utilize this basic definition, with the addition of  specific exclusions for ``seaplanes'' and ``aircraft'' (46 U.S.C. 527;  19 CFR 3.1(a)).    Sec. 783.40  ``Documented'' vessel.</p><p class="depth0">A vessel ``documented * * * under the laws of the United States'' is  typically a vessel which has been registered, enrolled and licensed, or  licensed by the Bureau of Customs under the laws of the United States  (46 U.S.C. 11, 193, 251-252, 258, 840). Although Bureau of Customs  regulations provide for three types of documentations, distinctions  between the categories of vessels subject to them are immaterial for the  purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act, since a vessel with any of the  three kinds of documentation is an ``American vessel'' within the  section 3(p) definition. Generally, any vessel of five net tons or more  which is owned by a citizen of the United States is ``entitled to''  documentation. Complete information on the documentation requirements  may be found in 19 CFR part 3.    Sec. 783.41  ``Numbered'' vessel.</p><p class="depth0">A vessel ``numbered under the laws of the United States'' means a  vessel numbered pursuant to the provisions of Federal law, including  vessels numbered under any State numbering system approved by the  Secretary of the Department under which the U.S. Coast Guard is  operating, in accordance with section 2(c) of the Federal Boating Act of  1958 (46 U.S.C. 527-527h). Generally, any vessel, which is not required  to have and does not have, a valid marine document issued by the Bureau  of Customs and is propelled by   machinery of more than 10 horsepower, whether or not such machinery is  the principal source of propulsion, is required to be numbered in  conformity with the Federal Boating Act of 1958 if it uses the navigable  waters of the United States, its Territories, or the District of  Columbia, or is owned in a State and uses the high seas (46 U.S.C.  527(a)). The requirements and procedures of this Act are explained in  detail in 46 CFR part 170.</p>
