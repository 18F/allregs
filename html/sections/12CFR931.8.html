                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Capital impairment. A Bank may not redeem or repurchase any capital stock without the prior written approval of the Finance Board if the Finance Board or the board of directors of the Bank has determined that the Bank has incurred or is likely to incur losses that result in or are likely to result in charges against the capital of the Bank. This prohibition shall apply even if a Bank is in compliance with its minimum capital requirements, and shall remain in effect for however long the Bank continues to incur such charges or until the Finance Board determines that such charges are not expected to continue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bank discretion to suspend redemption. A Bank, upon the approval of its board of directors, or of a subcommittee thereof, may suspend redemption of stock if the Bank reasonably believes that continued redemption of stock would cause the Bank to fail to meet its minimum capital requirements as set forth in Sec. Sec. 932.2 or 932.3 of this chapter, would prevent the Bank from maintaining adequate capital against a potential risk that may not be adequately reflected in its minimum capital requirements, or would otherwise prevent the Bank from operating in a safe and sound manner. A Bank shall notify the Finance Board in writing within two business days of the date of the decision to suspend the redemption of stock, informing the Finance Board of the reasons for the suspension and of the Bank's strategies and time frames for addressing the conditions that led to the suspension. The Finance Board may require the Bank to re-institute the redemption of member stock. A Bank shall not repurchase any stock without the written permission of the Finance Board during any period in which the Bank has suspended redemption of stock under this paragraph.
