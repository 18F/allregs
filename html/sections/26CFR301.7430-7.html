                                Sec. 301.7430-7  Qualified offers.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 7430(c)(4)(E) (the qualified offer rule)  provides that a party to a court proceeding satisfying the timely filing  and net worth requirements of section 7430(c)(4)(A)(ii) shall be treated  as the prevailing party if the liability of the taxpayer pursuant to the  judgment in the proceeding (determined without regard to interest) is  equal to or less than the liability of the taxpayer which would have  been so determined if the United States had accepted the last qualified  offer of the party as defined in section 7430(g). For purposes of this  section, the term judgment means the cumulative determinations of the  court concerning the adjustments at issue and litigated to a  determination in the court proceeding. In making the comparison between  the liability under the qualified offer and the liability under the  judgment, the taxpayer's liability under the judgment is further  modified by the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The  provisions of the qualified offer rule do not apply if the taxpayer's  liability under the judgment, as modified by the provisions of paragraph  (b)(3) of this section, is determined exclusively pursuant to a  settlement, or to any proceeding in which the amount of tax liability is  not in issue, including any declaratory judgment proceeding, any  proceeding to enforce or quash any summons issued pursuant to the  Internal Revenue Code (Code), and any action to restrain disclosure  under section 6110(f). If the qualified offer rule applies to the court  proceeding, the determination of whether the liability under the  qualified offer would have equaled or exceeded the liability pursuant to  the judgment is made by reference to the last qualified offer made with  respect to the tax liability at issue in the administrative or court  proceeding. An award of reasonable administrative and litigation costs  under the qualified offer rule only includes those costs incurred on or  after the date of the last qualified offer and is limited to those costs  attributable to the adjustments at issue at the time the last qualified  offer was made that were included in the court's judgment other than by  reason of settlement. The qualified offer rule is inapplicable to  reasonable administrative or litigation costs otherwise awarded to a  taxpayer who is a prevailing party under any other provision of section  7430(c)(4). This section sets forth the requirements to be satisfied for  a taxpayer to be treated as a prevailing party by reason of the taxpayer  making a qualified offer, as well as the circumstances leading to the  application of the exceptions, special rules, and coordination  provisions of the qualified offer rule. Furthermore, this section sets  forth the elements necessary for an offer to be treated as a qualified  offer under section 7430(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements for treatment as a prevailing party based upon  having made a qualified offer--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. In order to be treated as  a prevailing party by reason of having made a qualified offer, the  liability of the taxpayer for the type or types of tax and the taxable  year or years at issue in the proceeding (as calculated pursuant to  paragraph   (b)(2) of this section), based on the last qualified offer (as defined  in paragraph (c) of this section) made by the taxpayer in the court or  administrative proceeding, must equal or exceed the liability of the  taxpayer pursuant to the judgment by the court for the same type or  types of tax and the same taxable year or years (as calculated pursuant  to paragraph (b)(3) of this section). Furthermore, the taxpayer must  meet the timely filing and net worth requirements of section  7430(c)(4)(A)(ii). If all of the adjustments subject to the last  qualified offer are settled prior to the entry of the judgment by the  court, the taxpayer is not a prevailing party by reason of having made a  qualified offer. The taxpayer may, however, still qualify as a  prevailing party if the requirements of section 7430(c)(4)(A) are met.  If one or more adjustments covered by a qualified offer (see paragraph  (c)(3)) are settled following a ruling by the court that substantially  resolves those adjustments, then those adjustments will not be treated  as having been settled prior to the entry of the judgment by the court  and instead will be treated as amounts included in the judgment as a  result of the court's determinations. For purposes of the preceding  sentence, rulings relating to discovery, admissibility of evidence, and  burden of proof are not rulings that substantially resolve adjustments  covered by a qualified offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Liability under the last qualified offer. For purposes of  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the taxpayer's liability under the  last qualified offer is the change in the taxpayer's liability that  would have resulted if the United States had accepted the taxpayer's  last qualified offer on all of the adjustments that were at issue in the  administrative or court proceeding at the time that the offer was made  compared to the amount shown on the return or returns (or as previously  adjusted). The portion of a taxpayer's liability that is attributable to  adjustments raised by either party after the making of the last  qualified offer is not included in the calculation of the liability  under that offer. The taxpayer's liability under the last qualified  offer is calculated without regard to adjustments that the parties have  stipulated will be resolved in accordance with the outcome of a separate  pending Federal, state, or other judicial or administrative proceeding.  For example, the parties may stipulate that the taxpayer's liability  will be resolved in accordance with the outcome of an alternative  dispute resolution proceeding or a separate court proceeding, such as a  probate, tort liability, or trademark action. Furthermore, the  taxpayer's liability under the last qualified offer is calculated  without regard to interest, unless the taxpayer's liability for, or  entitlement to, interest is a contested issue in the administrative or  court proceeding and is one of the adjustments included in the last  qualified offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Liability pursuant to the judgment. For purposes of paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, the taxpayer's liability pursuant to the  judgment is the change in the taxpayer's liability resulting from  amounts contained in the judgment as a result of the court's  determinations, and amounts contained in settlements not included in the  judgment, that are attributable to all adjustments that were included in  the last qualified offer compared to the amount shown on the return or  returns (or as previously adjusted). This liability includes amounts  attributable to adjustments included in the last qualified offer and  settled by the parties prior to the entry of judgment regardless of  whether those amounts are actually included in the judgment entered by  the court. The taxpayer's liability pursuant to the judgment does not  include amounts attributable to adjustments that are not included in the  last qualified offer, even if those amounts are actually included in the  judgment entered by the court. The taxpayer's liability under the  judgment is calculated without regard to adjustments that the parties  have stipulated will be resolved in accordance with the outcome of a  separate pending Federal, state, or other judicial or administrative  proceeding. Furthermore, the taxpayer's liability pursuant to the  judgment is calculated without regard to interest, unless the taxpayer's  liability for, or entitlement to, interest is a contested issue in the  administrative or court proceeding and is one of the adjustments  included in   the last qualified offer. Where adjustments raised by either party  subsequent to the making of the last qualified offer are included in the  judgment entered by the court, or are settled prior to the court  proceeding, the taxpayer's liability pursuant to the judgment is  calculated by treating the subsequently raised adjustments as if they  had never been raised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Qualified offer--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A qualified offer is defined in  section 7430(g) to mean a written offer which--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is made by the taxpayer to the United States during the  qualified offer period;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specifies the offered amount of the taxpayer's liability  (determined without regard to interest, unless interest is a contested  issue in the proceeding);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is designated at the time it is made as a qualified offer for  purposes of section 7430(g); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> By its terms, remains open during the period beginning on the  date it is made and ending on the earliest of the date the offer is  rejected, the date the trial begins, or the 90th day after the date the  offer is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the United States. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A qualified offer is made to the  United States when it is delivered to the office or personnel within the  Internal Revenue Service, Office of Appeals, Office of Chief Counsel  (including field personnel) or Department of Justice that has  jurisdiction over the tax matter at issue in the administrative or court  proceeding. If those offices or persons are unknown to the taxpayer  making the qualified offer, the taxpayer may deliver the offer to the  appropriate office, as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the taxpayer's initial pleading in a court proceeding has  been answered, the taxpayer may deliver the offer to the office that  filed the answer.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the taxpayer's petition in the Tax Court has not yet been  answered, the taxpayer may deliver the offer to the Office of Chief  Counsel, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20224.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If the taxpayer's initial pleading in any Federal court, other  than the Tax Court, has not yet been answered, the taxpayer may deliver  the offer to the Attorney General of the United States, 950 Pennsylvania  Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20530-0001. For a suit brought in a United  States district court, a copy of the offer should also be delivered to  the United States Attorney for the district in which the suit was  brought.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> In any other situation, the taxpayer may deliver the offer to  the office that sent the taxpayer the first letter of proposed  deficiency which allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative  review in the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Until an offer is received by the appropriate personnel or  office under this paragraph (c)(2), it is not considered to have been  made, with the following exception. If the offer is deposited in the  United States mail, in an envelope or other appropriate wrapper, postage  prepaid, properly addressed to the appropriate personnel or office under  this paragraph (c)(2), the date of the United States postmark stamped on  the cover in which the offer is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of  receipt of that offer by the addressee. If any offer is deposited with a  designated delivery service, as defined in section 7502(f)(2), in lieu  of the United States mail, the provisions of section 7502(f)(1) shall  apply in determining whether that offer qualifies for this exception.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specifies the offered amount. A qualified offer specifies the  offered amount if it clearly specifies the amount for the liability of  the taxpayer, calculated as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section. The offer may be a specific dollar amount of the total  liability or a percentage of the adjustments at issue in the proceeding  at the time the offer is made. This amount must be with respect to all  of the adjustments at issue in the administrative or court proceeding at  the time the offer is made and only those adjustments. The specified  amount must be an amount, the acceptance of which by the United States  will fully resolve the taxpayer's liability, and only that liability  (determined without regard to adjustments that the parties have  stipulated will be resolved in accordance with the outcome of a separate  pending Federal, state, or other judicial or administrative proceeding,   or interest, unless interest is a contested issue in the proceeding) for  the type or types of tax and the taxable year or years at issue in the  proceeding. In cases involving multiple tax years, if adjustments in  different tax years arise from separate and distinct issues such that  the resolution of issues in one or more tax years will not affect the  taxpayer's liability in one or more of the other tax years in the  proceeding, then a qualified offer may be made for less than all of the  tax years involved. A qualified offer, however, must resolve all of the  issues for the tax years covered by the offer and also must cover all  tax years in the proceeding affected by those issues. A tax year  (affected year) is affected by an issue if the treatment of the issue in  another tax year involved in the proceeding necessarily affects the  treatment of the issue in the affected year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Designated at the time it is made as a qualified offer. An offer  is not a qualified offer unless it designates in writing at the time it  is made that it is a qualified offer for purposes of section 7430(g). An  offer made at a time when one or more adjustments not included in the  first letter of proposed deficiency which allows the taxpayer an  opportunity for administrative review in the Internal Revenue Service  Office of Appeals have been raised by the taxpayer and remain  unresolved, is not considered to be a qualified offer unless  contemporaneously or prior to the making of the offer, the taxpayer has  provided the United States with the substantiation and legal and factual  arguments necessary to allow for informed consideration of the merits of  those adjustments. For example, a taxpayer will be considered to have  provided the United States with the necessary substantiation and legal  and factual arguments if the taxpayer (or a recognized representative of  the taxpayer described in Sec. 601.502 of this chapter) participates in  an Appeals office conference, participates in an Area Counsel  conference, or confers with the Department of Justice, and at that time,  discloses all relevant information. All relevant information includes,  but is not limited to, the legal and factual arguments supporting the  taxpayer's position on any adjustments raised by the taxpayer after the  issuance of the first letter of proposed deficiency which allows the  taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the Internal  Revenue Service Office of Appeals. A taxpayer has disclosed all relevant  information if the taxpayer has supplied sufficient information to allow  informed consideration of the taxpayer's tax matter to the extent the  information and its relevance were known or should have been known to  the taxpayer at the time of the conference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Last qualified offer. A taxpayer may make multiple qualified  offers during the qualified offer period. For purposes of the comparison  under paragraph (b) of this section, the making of a qualified offer  supersedes any previously made qualified offers. In making the  comparison described in paragraph (b) of this section, only the  qualified offer made most closely in time to the end of the qualified  offer period is compared to the taxpayer's liability under the judgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em>, although  the period during which a qualified offer remains open may extend beyond  the end of the qualified offer period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Definition of a judgment, The Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) audits Taxpayer A for year X and issues a notice of proposed  deficiency (30-day letter) proposing to disallow deductions 1, 2, 3, and  4. A files a protest and participates in a conference with the Internal  Revenue Service Office of Appeals (Appeals). Appeals allows deduction 1,  and issues a statutory notice of deficiency for deductions 2, 3, and 4.  A's petition to the United States Tax Court for year X never mentions  deduction 2. Prior to trial, A concedes deduction 3. After the trial,  the Tax Court issues an opinion allowing A to deduct a portion of  deduction 4. As used in paragraph (a) of this section, the term judgment  means the cumulative determinations of the court concerning the  adjustments at issue in the court proceeding. Thus, the term judgment  does not include deduction 1 because it was never at issue in the court  proceeding. Similarly, the term judgment does not include deduction 2  because it was not placed at issue by A in the court proceeding.  Although deduction 3 was at issue in the court proceeding, it is not  included in the term judgment because it was not determined by the  court, but rather by concession or settlement. For purposes of section  7430(c)(4)(E), the term judgment only includes the portion of deduction  4 disallowed by the Tax Court.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Liability under the offer and liability under the  judgment, Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that A makes a  qualified offer after the Appeals conference, which is not accepted by  the IRS. A's offer is with respect to all adjustments at issue at that  time. Those adjustments are deductions 2, 3, and 4. At the conclusion of  the litigation, A's entitlement to an award based upon the qualified  offer will depend, among other things, on a comparison of the change in  A's liability for income tax for year X resulting from the judgment of  the Tax Court with the change that would have resulted had the IRS  accepted A's qualified offer. In making this comparison, the term  judgment (as discussed in Example 1) is modified by including the  amounts of settled or conceded adjustments that were at issue at the  time the qualified offer was made. Any settled or conceded adjustments  that were not at issue at the time the qualified offer was made, either  because the settlement or concession occurred before the offer or  because the adjustment was not raised until after the offer, are not  included in the comparison. Thus, A's offer on deductions 2, 3, and 4 is  compared with the change in A's liability resulting from the Tax Court's  determination of deduction 4, and the concessions of issues 2 and 3 by  A.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Offer must resolve full liability, Assume the same facts  as in Example 2 except that A's offer after the Appeals conference  explicitly states that it is only with respect to adjustments 2 and 3  and not with respect to adjustment 4. Even if A's liability pursuant to  the judgment, calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section as  illustrated in Example 2, is equal to or less than it would have been  had the IRS accepted A's offer after the Appeals conference, A is not a  prevailing party under section 7430(c)(4)(E). A qualified offer must  include all adjustments at issue at the time the offer is made. Since  A's offer excluded adjustment 4, which was an adjustment at issue at the  time the offer was made, it does not constitute a qualified offer  pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Offer must resolve full liability, Assume the same facts  as in Example 1, except that A makes a qualified offer that is accepted  by the IRS. After the offer is accepted, A attempts to reduce the amount  A will pay pursuant to the offer by applying net operating loss  carryovers to the years in issue. Because the net operating losses were  not at issue when the offer was made, A's offer was a qualified offer.  Whether A is entitled to apply net operating losses to reduce the amount  stated in the offer will depend upon the application of contract  principles, local court rules, and, because net operating   losses are at issue, section 6511(d) and related provisions.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. Qualified offer rule for multiple tax years, partial  resolution offer is a qualified offer, Taxpayer B receives a notice of  deficiency for taxable years 2001, 2002, and 2003. For 2001, the  statutory notice disallows business deductions. For 2002, the statutory  notice increases income for unreported lottery winnings. For 2003, the  statutory notice disallows a child care credit. B submits a qualified  offer only with respect to 2002. Since the adjustments for the three tax  years are separate and distinct, B may submit a qualified offer for a  single year. If B's liability under the judgment is equal to or less  than the qualified offer with respect to 2002, irrespective of 2001 and  2003, B is a prevailing party for 2002 for purposes of section 7430(g).  Assuming B satisfies the remaining requirements of section 7430, B may  recover reasonable administrative and litigation costs that are  attributable to 2002 from the date of the qualified offer. To qualify  for any costs with respect to 2001 or 2003, B must satisfy the  requirements of section 7430(c)(4).</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. Qualified offer rule for multiple tax years, partial  resolution offer is not a qualified offer, Assume the same facts as in  Example 5 except that with respect to 2002, in addition to increasing  B's income for the unreported lottery winnings, the statutory notice  also disallows a charitable contribution deduction. B submits a  settlement offer that purports to be a qualified offer, but only covers  the unreported lottery winnings. B's offer is not a qualified offer  because it does not address the charitable contribution issue, and thus,  does not fully resolve B's liability for 2002.</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. Qualified offer rule for multiple tax years, partial  resolution offer is not a qualified offer, Taxpayer C receives a notice  of deficiency for taxable years 2001, 2002, and 2003 adjusting the  amount of a depreciation deduction due to the Internal Revenue Service's  increase to the recovery period. C submits a settlement offer relating  only to 2003 that purports to be a qualified offer. C's offer is not a  qualified offer because the issue in the three tax years is not  separable given that the treatment of the issue in one of the years  necessarily affects the treatment of the issue in the other years, and  C's offer only applies to one of the years in the proceeding. In cases  involving multiple tax years with nonseparable tax issues affecting all  tax years, an offer is not a qualified offer unless it resolves the  liability for all tax years at issue in the administrative or judicial  proceeding.</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. Qualified offer rule inapplicable when all issues  settled, Taxpayer D receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day  letter) proposing to disallow both a personal interest deduction in the  amount of $10,000 (Adjustment 1), and a charitable contribution  deduction in the amount of $2,000 (Adjustment 2), and to include in  income $4,000 of unreported interest income (Adjustment 3). D timely  files a protest with Appeals. At the Appeals conference, D presents  substantiation for the charitable contribution and presents arguments  that the interest paid was deductible mortgage interest and that the  interest received was held in trust for Taxpayer E. At the conference, D  also provides the Appeals officer assigned to D's case a written offer  to settle the case for a deficiency of $2,000, exclusive of interest.  The offer states that it is a qualified offer for purposes of section  7430(g) and that it will remain open for acceptance by the IRS for a  period in excess of 90 days. After considering D's substantiation and  arguments, the Appeals Officer accepts the $2,000 offer to settle the  case in full. Although D's offer is a qualified offer, because all three  adjustments contained in the qualified offer were settled, the qualified  offer rule is inapplicable.</p><p class="depth2">Example 9. Qualified offer rule inapplicable when all issues  contained in the qualified offer are settled; subsequently raised  adjustments ignored, Assume the same facts as in Example 8 except that  D's qualified offer was for a deficiency of $1,800 and the IRS rejected  that offer. Subsequently, the IRS issued a statutory notice of  deficiency disallowing the three adjustments contained in Example 8,  and, in addition, disallowing a home office expense in the amount of  $5,000 (Adjustment 4). After petitioning the Tax Court, D presents the  field attorney assigned to the case with a written offer, which is not  designated as a qualified offer for purposes of section 7430(g), to  settle the three adjustments that had been the subject of the qualified  offer, plus adjustment 4, for a total deficiency of $2,500. After  negotiating with D, a settlement is reached on the three adjustments  that were the subject of the rejected qualified offer, for a deficiency  of $1,800. Adjustment 4 is litigated in the Tax Court and the court  determines that D is entitled to the full $5,000 deduction for that  adjustment. Consequently, a decision is entered by the Tax Court  reflecting the $1,800 settlement amount, which matches exactly the  amount of D's only qualified offer in the case. Although the determined  liability for adjustments 1, 2, and 3 equals that of the rejected  qualified offer, because all three adjustments contained in the  qualified offer were settled, the qualified offer rule is inapplicable.</p><p class="depth2">Example 10. Exclusion of adjustments made after the qualified offer  is made, Assume the same facts as in Example 9 except the settlement is  reached only on adjustments 1 and 2, for a liability of $1,500.  Adjustments 3 and 4 are tried in the Tax Court and in accordance with  the court's opinion, the taxpayer has a $300 deficiency attributable to  adjustment 3, and a $1,550 deficiency attributable to adjustment 4.  Consequently, a decision is entered   reflecting the $1,500 settled amount, the $300 liability on adjustment  3, and the $1,550 liability on adjustment 4. The $3,350 deficiency  reflected in the Tax Court's decision exceeds the last (and only)  qualified offer made by D. For purposes of determining whether D is a  prevailing party as a result of having made a qualified offer in the  proceeding, the liability attributable to adjustment 4, which was raised  after the last qualified offer was made, is not included in the  comparison of D's liability under the judgment with D's offered  liability under the last qualified offer. Thus, D's $1,800 liability  under the judgment, as modified for purposes of the qualified offer rule  comparison, is equal to D's offered liability under the last qualified  offer. Because D's liability under the last qualified offer equals or  exceeds D's liability under the judgment, as calculated under paragraph  (b)(3) of this section, D is a prevailing party for purposes of section  7430. Assuming D satisfies the remaining requirements of section 7430, D  may recover those reasonable administrative and litigation costs  attributable to adjustment 3. To qualify for any further award of  reasonable administrative and litigation costs, D must satisfy the  requirements of section 7430(c)(4)(A).</p><p class="depth2">Example 11. Qualified offer in a refund case, Taxpayer E timely  files an amended return claiming a refund of $1,000. This refund claim  results from several omitted deductions which, if allowed, would reduce  E's tax liability from $10,000 to $9,000. E receives a notice of claim  disallowance and files a complaint with the appropriate United States  District Court. Subsequently, E makes a qualified offer for a refund of  $500. The offer is rejected and after trial the court finds E is  entitled to a refund of $700. The change in E's liability from the tax  shown on the return that would have resulted from the acceptance of E's  qualified offer is a reduction in that liability of $500. The change in  E's liability from the tax shown on the return resulting from the  judgment of the court is a reduction in that liability of $700. Because  E's liability under the qualified offer exceeds E's liability under the  judgment, E is a prevailing party for purposes of section 7430. Assuming  E satisfies the remaining requirements of section 7430, E may recover  those reasonable litigation costs incurred on or after the date of the  qualified offer. To qualify for any further award of reasonable  administrative and litigation costs E must satisfy the requirements of  section 7430(c)(4)(A).</p><p class="depth2">Example 12. End of qualified offer period when case is removed from  Tax Court trial calendar more than 30 days before scheduled trial  calendar, Taxpayer F has petitioned the Tax Court in response to the  issuance of a notice of deficiency. F receives notice that the case will  be heard on the July trial session in F's city of residence. The  scheduled date for the calendar call for that trial session is July 1st.  On May 15th, F's motion to remove the case from the July trial session  and place it on the October trial session for that city is granted. The  scheduled date for the calendar call for the October trial session is  October 1st. On May 31st, F delivers a qualified offer to the field  attorney assigned to the case. On August 31st, F delivers a revised  qualified offer to the field attorney assigned to the case. Neither  offer is accepted. The case is tried during the October trial session,  and at some time thereafter, a decision is entered by the court. Assume  the judgment in the case, as calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this  section, is greater than the amount offered, as calculated under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in the qualified offer delivered on  May 31st, but less than the amount offered, as similarly calculated, in  the qualified offer delivered on August 31st. Because the qualified  offer period did not end until September 1st, and the offer of August  31st otherwise satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c) of this  section, the offer delivered on August 31st is a qualified offer.  Furthermore, because the August 31st qualified offer is closer in time  to the end of the qualified offer period than the May 31st qualified  offer, the August 31st qualified offer is the last qualified offer made  by F. Consequently, the August 31st offer is the qualified offer that is  compared to the judgment for purposes of determining whether F is a  prevailing party under section 7430(c)(4)(E). Because F's liability  under the August 31st qualified offer equals or exceeds F's liability  under the judgment as calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section,  F is a prevailing party for purposes of section 7430.</p><p class="depth2">Example 13. End of qualified offer period when case is removed from  Tax Court trial calendar less than 30 days before scheduled trial  calendar, Assume the same facts as in Example 12 except that F's motion  was granted on June 15th. Because the qualified offer period ended on  June 1st when the case remained on the July trial session on the date  that preceded by 30 days the scheduled date of the calendar call for  that trial session, the offer delivered on May 31st was F's last  qualified offer. The August 31st offer is not a qualified offer for  purposes of this rule. Consequently, F is not a prevailing party under  the qualified offer rule. Therefore, F must satisfy the requirements of  section 7430(c)(4)(A) to qualify for any award of reasonable  administrative and litigation costs.</p><p class="depth2">Example 14. When a qualified offer can be made and to whom it must  be made, During the examination of Taxpayer G's return, the IRS issues a  notice of deficiency without having first issued a 30-day letter. After  receiving the notice of deficiency G timely petitions the Tax Court. The  next day G mails an offer to the office that issued the notice of  deficiency, which offer satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)  through (6) of this   section. This is the only written offer made by G during the  administrative or court proceeding, and by its terms it is to remain  open for a period in excess of 90 days after the date of mailing to the  office issuing the notice of deficiency. The office that issued the  notice of deficiency transmitted the offer to the field attorney with  jurisdiction over the Tax Court case. After answering the case, the  field attorney refers the case to Appeals pursuant to Rev. Proc. 87-24  (1987-1 C.B. 720). See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter. After  careful consideration, Appeals rejects the offer and holds a conference  with G during which some adjustments are settled. The remainder of the  adjustments are tried in the Tax Court and G's liability resulting from  the Tax Court's determinations, when added to G's liability resulting  from the settled adjustments, is less than G's liability would have been  under the offer rejected by Appeals. Because the Tax Court case had not  yet been answered when the offer was sent, G properly mailed the offer  to the office that issued the notice of deficiency. Thus, G's offer  satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.  Furthermore, even though G did not receive a 30-day letter, G's offer  was made after the beginning of the qualified offer period, satisfying  the requirements of paragraph (c)(7) of this section, because the  issuance of the statutory notice provided G with notice of the IRS's  determination of a deficiency, and the docketing of the case provided G  with an opportunity for administrative review in the Internal Revenue  Service Office of Appeals under Rev. Proc. 87-24. See Sec.  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter. Because G's offer satisfied all of  the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the offer was a  qualified offer and G is a prevailing party.</p><p class="depth2">Example 15. Substitution of parties permitted under last qualified  offer, Taxpayer H receives a 30-day letter and participates in a  conference with the Office of Appeals but no agreement is reached.  Subsequently, H receives a notice of deficiency and petitions the Tax  Court. Upon receiving the Internal Revenue Service's answer to the  petition, H sends a qualified offer to the field attorney who signed the  answer, by United States mail. The qualified offer stated that it would  remain open for more than 90 days. Thirty days after making the offer, H  dies and, on motion under Rule 63(a) of the Tax Court's Rules of  Practice and Procedure by H's personal representative, I is substituted  for H as a party in the Tax Court proceeding. I makes no qualified  offers to settle the case and the case proceeds to trial, with the Tax  Court issuing an opinion partially in favor of I. Even though I was not  a party when the qualified offer was made by H, that offer constitutes a  qualified offer because by its terms, when made, it was to remain open  until at least the earlier of the date it is rejected, the date of  trial, or 90 days. If the liability of I under the qualified offer, as  determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, equals or exceeds the  liability under the judgment of the Tax Court, as determined under  paragraph (b)(3) of this section, I will be a prevailing party for  purposes of an award of reasonable litigation costs under section 7430.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective date.
