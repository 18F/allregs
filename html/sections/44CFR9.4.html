                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions shall apply throughout this regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Action means any action or activity including: (a) Acquiring,  managing and disposing of Federal lands and facilities; (b) providing  federally undertaken, financed or assisted construction and  improvements; and (c) conducting Federal activities and programs  affecting land use, including, but not limited to, water and related  land resources, planning, regulating and licensing activities.</p><p class="depth0">Actions Affecting or Affected by Floodplains or Wetlands means  actions which have the potential to result in the long- or short-term  impacts associated with (a) the occupancy or modification of  floodplains, and the direct or indirect support of floodplain  development, or (b) the destruction and modification of wetlands and the  direct or indirect support of new construction in wetlands.</p><p class="depth0">Administrator means the Administrator of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency.</p><p class="depth0">Agency means the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</p><p class="depth0">Agency Assistance means grants for projects or planning activities,  loans, and all other forms of financial or technical assistance provided  by the Agency.</p><p class="depth0">Base Flood means the flood which has a one percent chance of being  equalled or exceeded in any given year (also known as a 100-year flood).  This term is used in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to  indicate the minimum level of flooding to be used by a community in its  floodplain management regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Base Floodplain means the 100-year floodplain (one percent chance  floodplain).</p><p class="depth0">Coastal High Hazard Area means the areas subject to high velocity  waters including but not limited to hurricane wave wash or tsunamis. On  a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), this appears as zone V1-30, VE or V.</p><p class="depth0">Critical Action means an action for which even a slight chance of  flooding is too great. The minimum floodplain of concern for critical  actions is the 500-year floodplain, i.e., critical action floodplain.  Critical actions include, but are not limited to, those which create or  extend the useful life of structures or facilities:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Such as those which produce, use or store highly volatile,  flammable, explosive, toxic or water-reactive materials;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Such as hospitals and nursing homes, and housing for the  elderly, which are likely to contain occupants who may not be  sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and  storm events;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Such as emergency operation centers, or data storage centers  which contain records or services that may become lost or inoperative  during flood and storm events; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Such as generating plants, and other principal points of utility  lines.</p><p class="depth2">Direct Impacts means changes in floodplain or wetland values and  functions and changes in the risk to lives and property caused or  induced by an action or related activity. Impacts are caused whenever  these natural values and functions are affected as a direct result of an  action. An action which would result in the discharge of polluted storm  waters into a floodplain or wetland, for example, would directly affect  their natural values and functions. Construction-related activities,  such as dredging and filling operations within the floodplain or a  wetland would be another example of impacts caused by an action.</p><p class="depth2">Emergency Actions means emergency work essential to save lives and  protect property and public health and safety performed under sections  305 and 306 of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5145 and  5146). See 44 CFR part 205, subpart E.</p><p class="depth2">Enhance means to increase, heighten, or improve the natural and  beneficial values associated with wetlands.</p><p class="depth2">Facility means any man-made or man-placed item other than a  structure.</p><p class="depth2">FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p><p class="depth2">FIA means the Federal Insurance Administration.</p><p class="depth2">Five Hundred Year Floodplain (the 500-year floodplain or 0.2 percent  change floodplain) means that area, including the base floodplain, which  is subject to inundation from a flood having a 0.2 percent chance of  being equalled or exceeded in any given year.</p><p class="depth2">Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial  or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of  inland and/or tidal waters, and/or the unusual and rapid accumulation or  runoff of surface waters from any source.</p><p class="depth2">Flood Fringe means that portion of the floodplain outside of the  floodway (often referred to as ``floodway fringe'').</p><p class="depth2">Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) means an official map of a  community, issued by the Administrator, where the boundaries of the  flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and related erosion areas having special  hazards have been designated as Zone A, M, or E.</p><p class="depth2">Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of a community  on which the Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas  and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. FIRMs are also  available digitally, and are called Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps  (DFIRM).</p><p class="depth2">Flood Insurance Study (FIS) means an examination, evaluation and  determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water  surface elevations or an examination, evaluation and determination of  mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards.</p><p class="depth2">Floodplain means the lowland and relatively flat areas adjoining  inland and coastal waters including, at a minimum, that area subject to  a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Wherever  in this regulation the term ``floodplain'' is used, if a critical action  is involved, ``floodplain'' shall mean the area subject to inundation  from a flood having a 0.2 percent chance of occurring in any given year  (500-year floodplain). ``Floodplain'' does not include areas subject  only to mudflow until FIA adopts maps identifying ``M'' Zones.</p><p class="depth2">Floodproofing means the modification of individual structures and  facilities, their sites, and their contents to protect against  structural failure, to keep water out, or to reduce effects of water  entry.</p><p class="depth2">Floodway means that portion of the floodplain which is effective in  carrying flow, within which this carrying capacity must be preserved and  where the flood hazard is generally highest, i.e., where water depths  and velocities are the greatest. It is that area which provides for the  discharge of the base flood so the cumulative increase in water surface  elevation is no more than one foot.</p><p class="depth2">Functionally Dependent Use means a use which cannot perform its  intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity  to water, (e.g., bridges, and piers).</p><p class="depth2">Indirect Impacts means an indirect result of an action whenever the  action induces or makes possible related activities which effect the  natural values and functions of floodplains or wetlands or the risk to  lives and property.   Such impacts occur whenever these values and functions are potentially  affected, either in the short- or long-term, as a result of undertaking  an action.</p><p class="depth2">Minimize means to reduce to the smallest amount or degree possible.</p><p class="depth2">Mitigation means all steps necessary to minimize the potentially  adverse effects of the proposed action, and to restore and preserve the  natural and beneficial floodplain values and to preserve and enhance  natural values of wetlands.</p><p class="depth2">Mitigation Directorate means the Mitigation Directorate of the  Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p><p class="depth2">Natural Values of Floodplains and Wetlands means the qualities of or  functions served by floodplains and wetlands which include but are not  limited to: (a) Water resource values (natural moderation of floods,  water quality maintenance, groundwater recharge); (b) living resource  values (fish, wildlife, plant resources and habitats); (c) cultural  resource values (open space, natural beauty, scientific study, outdoor  education, archeological and historic sites, recreation); and (d)  cultivated resource values (agriculture, aquaculture, forestry).</p><p class="depth2">New Construction means the construction of a new structure  (including the placement of a mobile home) or facility or the  replacement of a structure or facility which has been totally destroyed.</p><p class="depth2">New Construction in Wetlands includes draining, dredging,  channelizing, filling, diking, impounding, and related activities and  any structures or facilities begun or authorized after the effective  dates of the Orders, May 24, 1977.</p><p class="depth2">Orders means Executive Orders 11988, Floodplain Management, and  11990, Protection of Wetlands.</p><p class="depth2">Practicable means capable of being done within existing constraints.  The test of what is practicable depends upon the situation and includes  consideration of all pertinent factors, such as environment, cost and  technology.</p><p class="depth2">Preserve means to prevent alterations to natural conditions and to  maintain the values and functions which operate the floodplains or  wetlands in their natural states.</p><p class="depth2">Regional Administrator means the Regional Administrator of the  Federal Emergency Management Agency for the Region in which FEMA is  acting, or the Disaster Recovery Manager when one is designated.</p><p class="depth2">Regulatory Floodway means the area regulated by federal, State or  local requirements to provide for the discharge of the base flood so the  cumulative increase in water surface elevation is no more than a  designated amount (not to exceed one foot as set by the National Flood  Insurance Program).</p><p class="depth2">Restore means to reestablish a setting or environment in which the  natural functions of the floodplain can again operate.</p><p class="depth2">Structures means walled or roofed buildings, including mobile homes  and gas or liquid storage tanks.</p><p class="depth2">Substantial Improvement means any repair, reconstruction or other  improvement of a structure or facility, which has been damaged in excess  of, or the cost of which equals or exceeds, 50% of the market value of  the structure or replacement cost of the facility (including all  ``public facilities'' as defined in the Disaster Relief Act of 1974) (a)  before the repair or improvement is started, or (b) if the structure or  facility has been damaged and is proposed to be restored, before the  damage occurred. If a facility is an essential link in a larger system,  the percentage of damage will be based on the relative cost of repairing  the damaged facility to the replacement cost of the portion of the  system which is operationally dependent on the facility. The term  ``substantial improvement'' does not include any alteration of a  structure or facility listed on the National Register of Historic Places  or a State Inventory of Historic Places.</p><p class="depth2">Support means to encourage, allow, serve or otherwise facilitate  floodplain or wetland development. Direct support results from actions  within a floodplain or wetland, and indirect support results from  actions outside of floodplains or wetlands.</p><p class="depth2">Wetlands means those areas which are inundated or saturated by  surface or ground water with a frequency sufficient to support, or that  under normal hydrologic conditions does or would support, a prevalence  of vegetation or   aquatic life typically adapted for life in saturated or seasonally  saturated soil conditions. Examples of wetlands include, but are not  limited to, swamps, fresh and salt water marshes, estuaries, bogs,  beaches, wet meadows, sloughs, potholes, mud flats, river overflows and  other similar areas. This definition includes those wetlands areas  separated from their natural supply of water as a result of activities  such as the construction of structural flood protection methods or  solid-fill road beds and activities such as mineral extraction and  navigation improvements. This definition is intended to be consistent  with the definition utilized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in  the publication entitled Classification of Wetlands and Deep Water  Habitats of the United States (Cowardin, et al., 1977).
