Communications are  limited to directing or coordinating ground activities from the air or  aerial activities from the ground. Air-to-air communications will be  authorized if the communications are directly connected with the air-to- ground or ground-to-air activities described above. Multicom  communications must not include those air/ground communications provided  for elsewhere in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If there is not unicom and an applicant is unable to meet the  requirements for a unicom license, the applicant will be eligible for a  multicom license.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The multicom license becomes invalid when a unicom is  established at the landing area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Multicoms must not be used for ATC purposes other than the relay  of ATC information between the pilot and air traffic controller.  Relaying of ATC information is limited to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Revisions of proposed departure time;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Takeoff, arrival flight plan cancellation time;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> ATC clearances, provided a letter of agreement is obtained  from the FAA by the licensee of the multicom.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Communications by a multicom must be limited to the safe and  expeditious operation of private aircraft, pertaining to the conditions  of runways, types of fuel available, wind conditions, weather  information, dispatching or other information. On a secondary basis,  multicoms may transmit communictions which pertain to efficient portal- to-portal transit of an aircraft such as requests for ground  transportation, food or lodging.</p>
