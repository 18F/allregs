                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary has determined that the applicable Federal housing  standards are the standards promulgated by the Employment and Training  Administration, at 20 CFR 654.404 et seq. and the standards promulgated  by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, at 29 CFR  1910.142. Except as provided in Sec. 500.131, all migrant housing is  subject to either the ETA standards or the OSHA standards, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A person who owns or controls a facility or real property to be  used for housing any migrant agricultural worker, the construction of  which was begun on or after April 3, 1980, and which was not under a  contract for construction as of March 4, 1980, shall comply with the  substantive Federal safety and health standards promulgated by OSHA at  29 CFR 1910.142. These OSHA standards are enforceable under MSPA,  irrespective of whether housing is, at any particular point in time,  subject to inspection under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A person who owns or controls a facility or real property to be  used for housing any migrant agricultural worker which was completed or  under construction prior to April 3, 1980, or which was under a contract  for construction prior to March 4, 1980, may elect to comply with either  the substantive Federal safety and health standards promulgated by OSHA  at 29 CFR 1910.142 or the standards promulgated by ETA at 20 CFR 654.404  et seq. The ETA standards were established to provide housing  requirements for migrant housing used by an employer obtaining migrant  workers through the U.S. Employment Service. The owner or operator of  such housing may continue to rely on those standards, rather than OSHA  standards, even if the housing is not currently being provided pursuant  to a USES job placement program.</p>
