                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Employees of foreign governments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exempt from tax. Except to  the extent that the exemption is limited by the execution and filing of  the waiver provided for in section 247(b) of the Immigration and  Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1257(b)), all employees of a foreign  government (including consular or other officers, or nondiplomatic  representatives) who are not citizens of the United States, or are  citizens of the Republic of the Philippines (whether or not citizens of  the United States), are exempt from Federal income tax with respect to  wages, fees, or salaries received by them as compensation for official  services rendered to such foreign government, provided (i) the services  are of a character similar to those performed by employees of the  Government of the United States in that foreign country and (ii) the  foreign government whose employees are claiming exemption grants an  equivalent exemption to employees of the Government of the United States  performing similar services in that foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certificate by Secretary of State. Section 893(b) provides that  the Secretary of State shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury  the names of the foreign countries which grant an equivalent exemption  to the employees of the Government of the United States   performing services in such foreign countries, and the character of the  services performed by employees of the Government of the United States  in foreign countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Items not exempt. The income received by employees of foreign  governments from sources other than their salaries, fees, or wages,  referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, is subject to Federal  income tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Immigration and Nationality Act. Section 247(b) of the  Immigration and Nationality Act provides as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 247. Adjustment of status of certain resident aliens.* * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The adjustment of status required by subsection (a) [of section  247 of the Immigration and Nationality Act] shall not be applicable in  the case of any alien who requests that he be permitted to retain his  status as an immigrant and who, in such form as the Attorney General may  require, executes and files with the Attorney General a written waiver  of all rights, privileges, exemptions, and immunities under any law or  any executive order which would otherwise accrue to him because of the  acquisition of an occupational status entitling him to a nonimmigrant  status under paragraph (15)(A), (15)(E), or (15)(G) of section 101(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effect of waiver. An employee of a foreign government who  executes and files with the Attorney General the waiver provided for in  section 247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act thereby waives the  exemption conferred by section 893 of the Code. As a consequence, that  exemption does not apply to income received by that alien after the date  of filing of the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Citizens of the United States. The compensation of citizens of  the United States (other than those who are also citizens of the  Republic of the Philippines) who are officers or employees of a foreign  government is not exempt from income tax pursuant to this paragraph. But  see section 911 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Employees of international organizations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exempt from tax.  Except to the extent that the exemption is limited by the execution and  filing of the waiver provided for in section 247(b) of the Immigration  and Nationality Act and subject to the provisions of sections 1, 8, and  9 of the International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288,  288e, 288f), wages, fees, or salary of any officer or employee of an  international organization (as defined in section 7701(a)(18)) received  as compensation for official services to that international organization  is exempt from Federal income tax, if that officer or employee (i) is  not a citizen of the United States or (ii) is a citizen of the Republic  of the Philippines (whether or not a citizen of the United States).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Income earned prior to executive action. An individual of the  prescribed class who receives wages, fees, or salary as compensation for  official services to an organization designated by the President through  appropriate Executive order as entitled to enjoy the privileges,  exemptions, and immunities provided in the International Organizations  Immunities Act and who has been duly notified to, and accepted by, the  Secretary of State as an officer or employee of that organization, or  who has been designated by the Secretary of State, prior to formal  notification and acceptance, as a prospective officer or employee of  that organization, may enjoy the benefits of the exemption with respect  to compensation of the prescribed character earned by that individual,  either prior to the date of the Issuance of the Executive order, or  prior to the date of the acceptance or designation by the Secretary of  State, for official services to that organization, if (i) the Executive  order does not provide otherwise, (ii) the organization is a public  international organization in which the United States participates,  pursuant to a treaty or under the authority of an act of Congress  authorizing such participation or making an appropriation for such  participation, at the time the compensation is earned, and (iii) the  individual is an officer or employee of that organization at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> International Organizations Immunities Act. Sections 1, 8, and 9  of the International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288, 288e,  288f) provide in part as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. For the purposes of this title [International  Organizations Immunities Act], the term ``international organization''  means a public international organization in which the United States  participates pursuant to any treaty or under the authority of any Act of  Congress authorizing such participation or making an appropriation for   such participation, and which shall have been designated by the  President through appropriate Executive order as being entitled to enjoy  the privileges, exemptions, and immunities herein provided. The  President shall be authorized, in the light of the functions performed  by any such international organization, by appropriate Executive order  to withhold or withdraw from any such organization or its officers or  employees any of the privileges, exemptions, and immunities provided for  in this title (including the amendments made by this title) or to  condition or limit the enjoyment by any such organization or its  officers or employees of any such privilege, exemption, or immunity. The  President shall be authorized, if in his judgment such action should be  justified by reason of the abuse by an international organization or its  officers and employees of the privileges, exemptions, and immunities  herein provided or for any other reason, at any time to revoke the  designation of any international organization under this section,  whereupon the international organization in question shall cease to be  classed as an international organization for the purposes of this title.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> No person shall be entitled to the benefits of this  title [International Organizations Immunities Act] unless he (1) shall  have been duly notified to and accepted by the Secretary of State as a *  * * officer, or employee; or (2) shall have been designated by the  Secretary of State, prior to formal notification and acceptance, as a  prospective * * * officer, or employee; * * *.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Should the Secretary of State determine that the continued  presence in the United States of any person entitled to the benefits of  this title is not desirable, he shall so inform the * * * international  organization concerned * * *, and after such person shall have had a  reasonable length of time, to be determined by the Secretary of State,  to depart from the United States, he shall cease to be entitled to such  benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No person shall, by reason of the provisions of this title, be  considered as receiving diplomatic status or as receiving any of the  privileges incident thereto other than such as are specifically set  forth herein.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 9. The privileges, exemptions, and immunities of international  organizations and of their officers and employees * * * provided for in  this title [International Organizations Immunities Act], shall be  granted notwithstanding the fact that the similar privileges,  exemptions, and immunities granted to a foreign government, its  officers, or employees, may be conditioned upon the existence of  reciprocity by that foreign government: Provided, That nothing contained  in this title shall be construed as precluding the Secretary of State  from withdrawing the privileges, exemptions, and immunities herein  provided from persons who are nationals of any foreign country on the  ground that such country is failing to accord corresponding privileges,  exemptions, and immunities to citizens of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effect of waiver. An officer or employee of an international  organization who executes and files with the Attorney General the waiver  provided for in section 247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8  U.S.C. 1257(b)) thereby waives the exemption conferred by section 893 of  the Code. As a consequence, that exemption does not apply to income  received by that individual after the date of filing of the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Citizens of the United States. The compensation of citizens of  the United States (other than those who are also citizens of the  Republic of the Philippines) who are officers or employees of an  international organization is not exempt from income tax pursuant to  this paragraph. But see section 911 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Tax conventions, consular conventions, and international  agreements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exemption dependent upon internal revenue laws. A tax  convention or consular convention between the United States and a  foreign country, which provides that the United States may include in  the tax base of its residents all income taxable under the internal  revenue laws, and which makes no specific exception for the income of  the employees of that foreign government, does not provide any exemption  (with respect to residents of the United States) beyond that which is  provided by the internal revenue laws. Accordingly, the effect of the  execution and filing of a waiver under section 247(b) of the Immigration  and Nationality Act by an employee of a foreign government which is a  party to such a convention is to subject the employee to tax to the same  extent as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section with respect to  the waiver of exemption under section 893.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exemption not dependent upon internal revenue laws. If a tax  convention, consular convention, or international agreement provides  that compensation paid by the foreign government or international  organization to its employees is exempt from Federal income   tax, and the application of this exemption is not dependent upon the  provisions of the internal revenue laws, the exemption so conferred is  not affected by the execution and filing of a waiver under section  247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. For examples of  exemptions which are not affected by the Immigration and Nationality  Act, see article X of the income tax convention between the United  States and the United Kingdom (60 Stat. 1383); article IX, section 9(b),  of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (60  Stat. 1414); and article VII, section 9(b), of the Articles of Agreement  of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (60 Stat.  1458).</p>
