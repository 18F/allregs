                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of this  section, an owner or operator may comply with paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reduce emissions of total organic HAP by 95 weight-percent.  Control shall be achieved by venting emissions through a closed vent  system to any combination of control devices meeting the requirements of  40 CFR part 63, subpart SS (national emission standards for closed vent  systems, control devices, recovery devices). When complying with the  requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS, the following apply for  purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Design evaluations are allowed for control devices that control  emission points with total emissions less than 10 tons of organic HAP  per year before control (i.e., small control devices).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS refers to specific test methods  for the measurement of organic HAP concentration, the test methods  presented in Sec.  63.1414(a) shall be used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The option to measure TOC instead of organic HAP, as a basis  for demonstrating compliance, is not allowed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Excused excursions are not allowed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The provisions in Sec.  63.1403(b), rather than the provisions  in Sec.  63.982(f), are to be followed for combined vent streams.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> When a scrubber is used as a control device, the owner or  operator shall follow the guidance provided in this subpart for design  evaluations or performance tests, as appropriate, and for monitoring,  recordkeeping, and reporting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> When there are conflicts between the due dates for reports  presented in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS and this subpart, reports shall  be submitted according to the due dates presented in this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> When there are conflicts between the recordkeeping and  reporting requirements presented in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS and this  subpart, the owner or operator shall either follow both sets of  requirements (i.e., follow the requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart  SS for emission points covered by 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS and follow  the requirements of this subpart for emission points covered by this  subpart) or shall follow the set of requirements they prefer. If an  owner or operator chooses to follow just one set of requirements, the  owner or operator shall identify which set of requirements are being  followed and which set of requirements are being disregarded in the  appropriate report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart WW  (national emission standards for storage vessels (control level 2)).  When complying with the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart WW, the  following apply for purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When there are conflicts between the due dates for reports  presented in 40 CFR part 63, subpart WW and this subpart, reports shall  be submitted according to the due dates presented in this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When there are conflicts between the recordkeeping and  reporting requirements presented in 40 CFR part 63, subpart WW and this  subpart, the owner or operator shall either follow both sets of  requirements (i.e., follow the requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart  WW for emission points covered by 40 CFR part 63, subpart WW and follow  the requirements of this subpart for emission points covered by this  subpart) or shall follow the set of requirements they prefer.

Vent all organic HAP emissions from a  storage vessel meeting either of the capacity and vapor pressure  criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section to a combustion  control device achieving an outlet organic HAP concentration of 20 ppmv  or less or to a non-combustion control device achieving an outlet  organic HAP concentration of 50 ppmv or less. Any storage vessels that  are not vented to a control device meeting these conditions shall be  controlled in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) or (2)  of this section.
