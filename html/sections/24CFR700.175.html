                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the Federal Requirements set forth in 24 CFR part 5, the following requirements apply to grant recipient organizations in this program:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards. The policies, guidelines, and requirements in 2 CFR part 200, including the audit requirements described in subpart F, apply to the acceptance and use of assistance under this program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conflict of interest. In addition to the conflict of interest requirements in 2 CFR 200.112 (for all recipients and subrecipients); 200.317 (for recipients and subrecipients that are States); and 200.318(c) and 200.319(a)(5) (for recipients and subrecipients that are not States), no person who is an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected or appointed official of the applicant, and who exercises or has exercised any function or responsibilities with respect to activities assisted with CHSP grant funds, or who is in a position to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a personal or financial interest or benefit from the activity, or have an interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement with respect thereto, or any proceeds thereunder, either for himself or herself or for those with whom he or she has family or business ties during his or her tenure, or for one year thereafter. CHSP employees may receive reasonable salary and benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disclosures required by Reform Act. Section 102(c) of the HUD Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545(c)) requires disclosure concerning other government assistance to be made available with respect to the Program and parties with a pecuniary interest in CHSP and submission of a report on expected sources and uses of funds to be made available for CHSP.

Support services, including the operating and administrative expenses described in section 700.115(a), are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. These actions, however, are not excluded from individual compliance requirements of other environmental statutes, Executive Orders, and agency regulations where appropriate. When the responsible official determines that any action under this part may have an environmental effect because of extraordinary circumstances, the requirements of NEPA shall apply.
