                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose of this subpart. This subpart defines the Federal Bureau  of Prisons' (Bureau) authority to operate, and designate inmates to,  Communications Management Housing Units (CMUs) within Bureau facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> CMU. A CMU is a general population housing unit where inmates  ordinarily reside, eat, and participate in all educational,  recreational, religious, visiting, unit management, and work  programming, within the confines of the CMU. Additionally, CMUs may  contain a range of cells dedicated to segregated housing of inmates in  administrative detention or disciplinary segregation status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Purpose of CMUs. The purpose of CMUs is to provide an inmate  housing unit environment that enables staff to more effectively monitor  communication between inmates in CMUs and persons in the community. The  ability to monitor such communication is necessary to ensure the safety,  security, and orderly operation of correctional facilities, and  protection of the public. The volume, frequency, and methods, of CMU  inmate contact with persons in the community may be limited as necessary  to achieve the goal of total monitoring, consistent with this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application. Any inmate (as defined in 28 CFR 500.1(c)) meeting  criteria prescribed by this subpart may be designated to a CMU.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Relationship to other regulations. The regulations in this  subpart supersede and control to the extent they conflict with, are  inconsistent with, or impose greater limitations than the regulations in  this part, or any other regulations in this chapter, except 28 CFR part  501.</p>
