These examples assume that your lease is located in the GOM west of 87  degrees, 30 minutes West longitude and in water less than 400 meters  deep (see Sec.  203.30(a)), has no existing deep or ultra-deep wells and  that the price thresholds prescribed in Sec.  203.36 have not been  exceeded.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: In 2008, you drill and begin producing from an ultra-deep  well with a perforated interval the top of which is 25,000 feet TVD SS,  and your lease has had no prior production from a deep or ultra-deep  well. Assuming your lease has no deepwater royalty relief (see Sec.   203.30(c)), your lease is eligible (according to Sec.  203.30(b)) to  earn an RSV under Sec.  203.31 because it has not yet produced from a  deep well. Your lease earns an RSV of 35 BCF under this section when  this well begins producing. According to Sec.  203.31(a), your 25,000  foot well qualifies your lease for this RSV because the well was drilled  after the relief authorized here became effective (when the proposed  version of this rule was published on May 18, 2007) and produced from an  interval that meets the criteria for an ultra-deep well (i.e., is a  phase 2 ultra-deep well as defined in Sec.  203.0). Then in 2014, you  drill and produce from another ultra-deep well with a perforated  interval the top of which is 29,000 feet TVD SS. Your lease earns no  additional RSV under this section when this second ultra-deep well  produces, because your lease no longer meets the condition in (Sec.   203.30(b)) of no production from a deep well. However, any remaining RSV  earned by the first ultra-deep well on your lease would be applied to  production from both the first and the second ultra-deep wells as  prescribed in Sec.  203.33(a)(2), or Sec.  203.33(b)(2) if your lease is  part of a unit.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2: In 2005, you spudded and began producing from an ultra- deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 23,000 feet TVD  SS. Your lease earns no RSV under this section from this phase 1 ultra- deep well (as defined in Sec.  203.0) because you spudded the well  before the publication date (May 18, 2007) of the proposed rule when  royalty relief under Sec.  203.31(a) became effective. However, this  ultra-deep well may earn an RSV of 25 BCF for your lease under Sec.   203.41 (that became effective May 3, 2004), if the lease is located in  water depths partly or entirely less than 200 meters and has not  previously produced from a deep well (Sec.  203.30(b)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3: In 2000, you began producing from a deep well with a  perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and your  lease is located in water 100 meters deep. Then in 2008, you drill and  produce from a new ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of  which is 24,000 feet TVD SS. Your lease earns no RSV under either this  section or Sec.  203.41 because the 16,000-foot well was drilled before  we offered any way to earn an RSV for producing from a deep well (see  dates in the definition of qualified well in Sec.  203.0) and because  the existence of the 16,000-foot well means the lease is not eligible  (see Sec.  203.30(b)) to earn an RSV for the 24,000-foot well. Because  the lease existed in the year 2000, it cannot be eligible for the  exception to this eligibility condition provided in Sec.  203.31(b).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4: In 2008, you spud and produce from an ultra-deep well  with a perforated interval the top of which is 22,000 feet TVD SS, your  lease is located in water 300 meters deep, and your lease has had no  previous production from a deep or ultra-deep well. Your lease earns an  RSV of 35 BCF under this section when this well begins producing because  your lease meets the conditions in Sec.  203.30 and the well fits the  definition of a phase 2 ultra-deep well (in Sec.  203.0). Then in 2010,  you spud and produce from a deep well with a perforated interval the top  of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS. Your 16,000-foot well earns no RSV  because it is on a lease that already has a producing well at least  18,000 feet subsea (see Sec.  203.42(a)), but any remaining RSV earned  by the ultra-deep well would also be applied to production from the deep  well as prescribed in Sec.  203.33(a)(2), or Sec.  203.33(b)(2) if your  lease is part of a unit and Sec.  203.43(a)(2), or Sec.  203.43(b)(2) if  your lease is part of a unit. However, if the 16,000-foot deep well does  not begin production until 2016 (or if your lease were located in water  less than 200 meters deep), then the 16,000-foot well would not be a  qualified deep well because this well does not begin production within  the interval   specified in the definition of a qualified well in Sec.  203.0, and the  RSV earned by the ultra-deep well would not be applied to production  from this (unqualified) deep well.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5: In 2008, you spud a deep well with a perforated interval  the top of which is 17,000 feet TVD SS that becomes a qualified well and  earns an RSV of 15 BCF under Sec.  203.41 when it begins producing. Then  in 2011, you spud an ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top  of which is 26,000 feet TVD SS. Your 26,000-foot well becomes a  qualified ultra-deep well because it meets the date and depth conditions  in this definition under Sec.  203.0 when it begins producing, but your  lease earns no additional RSV under this section or Sec.  203.41 because  it is on a lease that already has production from a deep well (see Sec.   203.30(b)). Both the qualified deep well and the qualified ultra-deep  well would share your lease's total RSV of 15 BCF in the manner  prescribed in Sec. Sec.  203.33 and 203.43.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6: In 2008, you spud a qualified ultra-deep well that is a  sidetrack with a sidetrack measured depth of 21,000 feet and a  perforated interval the top of which is 25,000 feet TVD SS. This well  meets the definition of an ultra-deep well but is too long to be  classified an ultra-deep short sidetrack in Sec.  203.0. If your lease  is located in 150 meters of water and has not previously produced from a  deep well, your lease earns an RSV of 35 BCF because it was drilled  after the effective date for earning this RSV. Further, this RSV applies  to gas production from this and any future qualified deep and qualified  ultra-deep wells on your lease, as prescribed in Sec.  203.33. The  absence of an expiration date for earning an RSV on an ultra-deep well  means this long sidetrack well becomes a qualified well whenever it  starts production. If your sidetrack has a sidetrack measured depth of  14,000 feet and begins production in March 2009, it earns an RSV of 12.4  BCF under this section because it meets the definitions of a phase 2  ultra-deep well (production begins before the expiration date for the  pre-existing relief in its water depth category) and an ultra-deep short  sidetrack in Sec.  203.0. However, if it does not begin production until  2010, it earns no RSV because it is too short as a phase 3 ultra-deep  well to be a qualified ultra-deep well.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7: Your lease was issued in June 2004 and expressly  incorporates the provisions of Sec. Sec.  203.41 through 203.47 as they  existed at that time. In January 2005, you spud a deep well (well no. 1)  with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,800 feet TVD SS that  becomes a qualified well and earns an RSV of 15 BCF under Sec.  203.41  when it begins producing. Then in February 2008, you spud an ultra-deep  well (well no. 2) with a perforated interval the top of which is 22,300  feet that begins producing in November 2008, after well no. 1 has  started production. Well no. 2 earns your lease an additional RSV of 10  BCF under paragraph (b) of this section because it begins production in  time to be classified as a phase 2 ultra-deep well. If, on the other  hand, well no. 2 had begun producing in June 2009, it would earn no  additional RSV for the lease because it would be classified as a phase 3  ultra-deep well and thus is not entitled to the exception under  paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
