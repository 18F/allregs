                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The requirements of Sec.  14.81 may be met by complying with one of the following alternatives to the marking requirement:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> Conspicuously marking the outside of each container or package containing fish or wildlife with the word ``fish'' or ``wildlife'' as appropriate for its contents, or with the common name of its contents by species, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conspicuously marking the outside of each container or package containing fish or wildlife with the word ``fish'' or ``wildlife'' as appropriate for its contents, or with the common name of its contents by species, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Including an invoice, packing list, bill of lading, or similar document to accompany the shipment which accurately states the name and address of the shipper and consignee, states the total number of packages or containers in the shipment, and for each species in the shipment specifies:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The common name that identifies the species (examples include: Chinook (or king) salmon; bluefin tuna; and whitetail deer) and whether or not the listed species is venomous; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The number of that species (or other appropriate measure of quantity such as gross or net weight).
The invoice, packing list, bill of lading, or equivalent document must be securely attached to the outside of one container or package in the shipment or otherwise physically accompany the shipment in a manner which makes it readily accessible for inspection; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Affixing the shipper's wildlife import/export license number preceded by the three letters ``FWS'' on the outside of each container or package containing fish or wildlife, if the shipper has valid wildlife import/export license issued under authority of 50 CFR part 14. For each shipment marked in accordance with this paragraph, the records maintained under Sec.  14.93(c) must include a copy of the invoice, packing list, bill of lading, or other similar document that accurately states the information required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of subcontainers or packages within a larger packing container, only the outermost container must be marked in accordance with this section. Except, that for live fish or wildlife that are packed in subcontainers within a larger packing container, if the subcontainers are numbered or labeled, the packing list, invoice, bill or lading, or other similar document, must reflect that number or label. However, each subcontainer containing a venomous species must be clearly marked as venomous.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A conveyance (truck, plane, boat, etc.) is not considered a container for purposes of requiring specific marking of the conveyance itself, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fish or wildlife within the conveyance is carried loosely or is readily identifiable, and is accompanied by the document required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The fish or wildlife is otherwise packaged and marked in accordance with this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The requirements of Sec.  14.81 do not apply to containers or packages containing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fox, nutria, rabbit, mink, chinchilla, marten, fisher, muskrat, and karakul that have been bred and born in captivity, or their products, if a signed statement certifying that the animals were bred and born in captivity accompanies the shipping documents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fish or shellfish contained in retail consumer packages labeled pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fish or shellfish that are landed by, and offloaded from, a fishing vessel (whether or not the catch has been carried by the fishing vessel interstate), as long as the fish or shellfish remain at the place where first offloaded.
