It is often made of sheet metal and often has sections connected by screws or crimping. Hard-piping is not ductwork.</p><p class="depth0">Equipment means each pump, compressor, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, and flange or other connector in VOC service and any devices or systems required by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">First attempt at repair means to take action for the purpose of stopping or reducing leakage of organic material to the atmosphere using best practices.</p><p class="depth0">Fuel gas means gases that are combusted to derive useful work or heat.</p><p class="depth0">Fuel gas system means the offsite and onsite piping and flow and pressure control system that gathers gaseous stream(s) generated by onsite operations, may blend them with other sources of gas, and transports the gaseous stream for use as fuel gas in combustion devices or in-process combustion equipment, such as furnaces and gas turbines, either singly or in combination.</p><p class="depth0">Hard-piping means pipe or tubing that is manufactured and properly installed using good engineering judgment and standards such as ASME B31.3, Process Piping (available from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, PO Box 2300, Fairfield, NJ 07007-2300).</p><p class="depth0">In gas/vapor service means that the piece of equipment contains process fluid that is in the gaseous state at operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0">In heavy liquid service means that the piece of equipment is not in gas/vapor service or in light liquid service.</p><p class="depth0">In light liquid service means that the piece of equipment contains a liquid that meets the conditions specified in Sec. 60.485(e).</p><p class="depth0">In-situ sampling systems means nonextractive samplers or in-line samplers.</p><p class="depth0">In vacuum service means that equipment is operating at an internal pressure which is at least 5 kilopascals (kPa)(0.7 psia) below ambient pressure.</p><p class="depth0">In VOC service means that the piece of equipment contains or contacts a process fluid that is at least 10 percent VOC by weight. (The provisions of Sec. 60.485(d) specify how to determine that a piece of equipment is not in VOC service.)</p><p class="depth0">Liquids dripping means any visible leakage from the seal including spraying, misting, clouding, and ice formation.</p><p class="depth0">Open-ended valve or line means any valve, except safety relief valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with process fluid and one side open to the atmosphere, either directly or through open piping.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from system pressure being greater than set pressure of the pressure relief device.</p><p class="depth0">Process improvement means routine changes made for safety and occupational health requirements, for energy savings, for better utility, for ease of maintenance and operation, for correction of design deficiencies, for bottleneck removal, for changing product requirements, or for environmental control.</p><p class="depth0">Process unit means the components assembled and connected by pipes or ducts to process raw materials and to produce, as intermediate or final products, one or more of the chemicals listed in Sec. 60.489. A process unit can operate independently if supplied with sufficient feed or raw materials and sufficient storage facilities for the product.
