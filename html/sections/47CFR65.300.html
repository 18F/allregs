                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sections 65.301 through 65.303 specify the calculations that are to be performed in computing cost of debt, cost of preferred stock, and financial structure weights for prescription proceedings. The calculations shall determine, where applicable, a composite cost of debt, a composite cost of preferred stock, and a composite financial structure for all local exchange carriers with annual revenues equal to or above the indexed revenue threshold as defined in Sec. 32.9000. The calculations shall be based on data reported to the Commission in FCC Report 43-02. (See 47 CFR 43.21). The results of the calculations shall be used in the represcription proceeding to which they relate unless the record in that proceeding shows that their use would be unreasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Excluded from cost of capital calculations made pursuant to Sec. 65.300 shall be those sources of financing that are not investor supplied, or that are otherwise subtracted from a carrier's rate base pursuant to Commission orders governing the calculation of net rate base amounts in tariff filings that are made pursuant to section 203 of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. 203, or that were treated as ``zero cost'' sources of financing in section 450 and subpart G of this part 65. Specifically excluded are: accounts payable, accrued taxes, accrued interest, dividends payable, deferred credits and operating reserves, deferred taxes and deferred tax credits.
