                            <p class="depth0">Except in expedited cases (generally those of $25,000 or less; see Sec. 16.12 for details), the appellant and the respondent each participate in developing an appeal file for the Board to review. Each also submits written argument in support of its position. The responsibilities of each are as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The appellant's responsibility. Within 30 days after receiving the acknowledgment of the appeal, the appellant shall submit the following to the Board (with a copy to the respondent):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An appeal file containing the documents supporting the claim, tabbed and organized chronologically and accompanied by an indexed list identifying each document. The appellant should include only those documents which are important to the Board's decision on the issues in the case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A written statement of the appellant's argument concerning why the respondent's final decision is wrong (appellant's brief).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The respondent's responsibility. Within 30 days after receiving the appellant's submission under paragraph (a) of this section, the respondent shall submit the following to the Board (with a copy to the appellant):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A supplement to the appeal file containing any additional documents supporting the respondent's position, organized and indexed as indicated under paragraph (a) of this section. The respondent should avoid submitting duplicates of documents submitted by the appellant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A written statement (respondent's brief) responding to the appellant's brief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The appellant's reply. Within 15 days after receiving the respondent's submission, the appellant may submit a short reply. The appellant should avoid repeating arguments already made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cooperative efforts. Whenever possible, the parties should try to develop a joint appeal file, agree to preparation of the file by one of them, agree to facts to eliminate the need for some documents, or agree that one party will submit documents identified by the other.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Voluminous documentation. Where submission of all relevant documents would lead to a voluminous appeal file (for example where review of a disputed audit finding of inadequate documentation might involve thousands of receipts), the Board will consult with the parties about how to reduce the size of the file.</p>
