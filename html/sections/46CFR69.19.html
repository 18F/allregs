                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a vessel that is already measured is to undergo a structural alteration or if the use of a space within that vessel is to be changed, a remeasurement may be required. Vessel owners shall report immediately to an authorized measurement organization any intent to structurally alter the vessel or to change the use of a space within the vessel. The organization advises the owner if remeasurement is necessary. Spaces not affected by the alteration or change need not be remeasured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When there is a perceived error in the application of a regulation or in the tonnage calculations, the vessel owner should contact the responsible measurement organization. If the error is verified, the tonnage is adjusted as necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a remeasurement or adjustment of tonnage is required, the organization will issue a new tonnage certificate. If the vessel is documented, the vessel's owner must surrender the Certificate of Documentation as required under part 67, subpart 67.25, of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A vessel of less than 79 feet in overall length measured under the Standard or Dual Measurement Systems may be remeasured at the owner's request under the Simplified Measurement System.
