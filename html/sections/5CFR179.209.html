                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In response to a notice of intent, an employee may propose to  repay the debt by making voluntary installment payments as an  alternative to salary offset. An employee who wishes to repay a debt  without salary offset shall submit in writing a proposed agreement to  repay the debt. The proposal shall admit the existence of the debt, and  the agreement must be in such form that it is legally enforceable. The  agreement must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be in writing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be signed by both the employee and the creditor agency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Specify all the terms of the arrangement for payment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Contain a provision accelerating the debt in the event of  default by the debtor, but such an increase may not result in a  deduction that exceeds 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay  unless the employee has agreed in writing to deduction of a greater  amount (5 CFR 550.1104(i)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any proposal under paragraph (a) of this section must be  received by the official designated in the notice of intent within 30  calendar days after receipt of the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The creditor agency will review a timely and properly submitted  repayment proposal by the employee debtor and notify the employee  whether the proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It  is within the creditor agency's discretion to accept a repayment  agreement instead of proceeding by offset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the creditor agency decides that the proposed repayment  agreement is unacceptable, the employee will have 15 days from the date  he or she received notice of that decision to file a petition for a  hearing or a special review as provided by Sec. 179.210.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the creditor agency decides that the proposed repayment  agreement is acceptable, the alternative arrangement must be in writing,  signed by both the employee and the creditor agency designee and meet  the other requirements of this section for a voluntary repayment  agreement.</p>
