During periods of startup or shutdown, as an alternative to  using Equation 1 of this subpart, the owner or operator may divide the  emission rate of total organic HAP or TOC during startup or shutdown by  the rate of polymer produced from the most recent performance test  associated with a production rate greater than zero to determine  compliance with the emission limit.

The weight of polymer pulled shall be  determined by direct measurement or by an alternate methodology, such as  materials balance. If an alternate methodology is used, a description of  the methodology, including all procedures, data, and assumptions shall  be submitted as part of the Notification of Compliance Status required  by Sec.  63.1335(e)(5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use engineering assessment, as described in Sec.   63.1323(b)(6)(i), to demonstrate that mass emissions per mass product  are less than or equal to 0.07 kg organic HAP/Mg product. If engineering  assessment shows that mass emissions per mass product are greater than  0.07 kg organic HAP/Mg product and the owner or operator wishes to  demonstrate that mass emissions per mass product are less than the  threshold emission rate of 0.12 kg organic HAP/Mg product, the owner or  operator shall use the procedures specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)(i)</em> shall demonstrate  compliance with the mass emissions per mass product requirements using  the procedures specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. During  periods of startup or shutdown, as an alternative to using the  procedures specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or  operator may divide the emission rate of total organic HAP or TOC during  startup or shutdown by the rate of polymer produced from the most recent  performance test associated with a production rate greater than zero to  comply with the emission limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(3)</em>.
