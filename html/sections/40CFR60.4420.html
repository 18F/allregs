                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein will have the  meaning given them in the Clean Air Act and in subpart A (General  Provisions) of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Biogas means gas produced by the anaerobic digestion or fermentation  of organic matter including manure, sewage sludge, municipal solid  waste, biodegradable waste, or any other biodegradable feedstock, under  anaerobic conditions. Biogas is comprised primarily of methane and  CO2.</p><p class="depth0">Combined cycle combustion turbine means any stationary combustion  turbine which recovers heat from the combustion turbine exhaust gases to  generate steam that is only used to create additional power output in a  steam turbine.</p><p class="depth0">Combined heat and power combustion turbine means any stationary  combustion turbine which recovers heat from the exhaust gases to heat  water or another medium, generate steam for useful purposes other than  additional electric generation, or directly uses the heat in the exhaust  gases for a useful purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Combustion turbine model means a group of combustion turbines having  the same nominal air flow, combustor inlet pressure, combustor inlet  temperature, firing temperature, turbine inlet temperature and turbine  inlet pressure.</p><p class="depth0">Combustion turbine test cell/stand means any apparatus used for  testing   uninstalled stationary or uninstalled mobile (motive) combustion  turbines.</p><p class="depth0">Diffusion flame stationary combustion turbine means any stationary  combustion turbine where fuel and air are injected at the combustor and  are mixed only by diffusion prior to ignition.</p><p class="depth0">Duct burner means a device that combusts fuel and that is placed in  the exhaust duct from another source, such as a stationary combustion  turbine, internal combustion engine, kiln, etc., to allow the firing of  additional fuel to heat the exhaust gases before the exhaust gases enter  a heat recovery steam generating unit.</p><p class="depth0">Efficiency means the combustion turbine manufacturer's rated heat  rate at peak load in terms of heat input per unit of power output--based  on the higher heating value of the fuel.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency combustion turbine means any stationary combustion turbine  which operates in an emergency situation. Examples include stationary  combustion turbines used to produce power for critical networks or  equipment, including power supplied to portions of a facility, when  electric power from the local utility is interrupted, or stationary  combustion turbines used to pump water in the case of fire or flood,  etc. Emergency stationary combustion turbines do not include stationary  combustion turbines used as peaking units at electric utilities or  stationary combustion turbines at industrial facilities that typically  operate at low capacity factors. Emergency combustion turbines may be  operated for the purpose of maintenance checks and readiness testing,  provided that the tests are required by the manufacturer, the vendor, or  the insurance company associated with the turbine. Required testing of  such units should be minimized, but there is no time limit on the use of  emergency combustion turbines.</p><p class="depth0">Excess emissions means a specified averaging period over which  either (1) the NOX emissions are higher than the applicable  emission limit in Sec. 60.4320; (2) the total sulfur content of the  fuel being combusted in the affected facility exceeds the limit  specified in Sec. 60.4330; or (3) the recorded value of a particular  monitored parameter is outside the acceptable range specified in the  parameter monitoring plan for the affected unit.</p><p class="depth0">Gross useful output means the gross useful work performed by the  stationary combustion turbine system. For units using the mechanical  energy directly or generating only electricity, the gross useful work  performed is the gross electrical or mechanical output from the turbine/ generator set. For combined heat and power units, the gross useful work  performed is the gross electrical or mechanical output plus the useful  thermal output (i.e., thermal energy delivered to a process).</p><p class="depth0">Heat recovery steam generating unit means a unit where the hot  exhaust gases from the combustion turbine are routed in order to extract  heat from the gases and generate steam, for use in a steam turbine or  other device that utilizes steam. Heat recovery steam generating units  can be used with or without duct burners.</p><p class="depth0">Integrated gasification combined cycle electric utility steam  generating unit means a coal-fired electric utility steam generating  unit that burns a synthetic gas derived from coal in a combined-cycle  gas turbine. No solid coal is directly burned in the unit during  operation.</p><p class="depth0">ISO conditions means 288 Kelvin, 60 percent relative humidity and  101.3 kilopascals pressure.</p><p class="depth0">Lean premix stationary combustion turbine means any stationary  combustion turbine where the air and fuel are thoroughly mixed to form a  lean mixture before delivery to the combustor. Mixing may occur before  or in the combustion chamber. A lean premixed turbine may operate in  diffusion flame mode during operating conditions such as startup and  shutdown, extreme ambient temperature, or low or transient load.</p><p class="depth0">Natural gas means a naturally occurring fluid mixture of  hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane, or propane) produced in geological  formations beneath the Earth's surface that maintains a gaseous state at  standard atmospheric temperature and pressure under ordinary conditions.  Additionally, natural gas must either be composed of at least 70 percent  methane by volume or have a gross calorific value between 950 and 1,100  British thermal units (Btu) per   standard cubic foot. Natural gas does not include the following gaseous  fuels: landfill gas, digester gas, refinery gas, sour gas, blast furnace  gas, coal-derived gas, producer gas, coke oven gas, or any gaseous fuel  produced in a process which might result in highly variable sulfur  content or heating value.</p><p class="depth0">Noncontinental area means the State of Hawaii, the Virgin Islands,  Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Northern  Mariana Islands, or offshore platforms.</p><p class="depth0">Peak load means 100 percent of the manufacturer's design capacity of  the combustion turbine at ISO conditions.</p><p class="depth0">Regenerative cycle combustion turbine means any stationary  combustion turbine which recovers heat from the combustion turbine  exhaust gases to preheat the inlet combustion air to the combustion  turbine.</p><p class="depth0">Simple cycle combustion turbine means any stationary combustion  turbine which does not recover heat from the combustion turbine exhaust  gases to preheat the inlet combustion air to the combustion turbine, or  which does not recover heat from the combustion turbine exhaust gases  for purposes other than enhancing the performance of the combustion  turbine itself.</p><p class="depth0">Stationary combustion turbine means all equipment, including but not  limited to the turbine, the fuel, air, lubrication and exhaust gas  systems, control systems (except emissions control equipment), heat  recovery system, and any ancillary components and sub-components  comprising any simple cycle stationary combustion turbine, any  regenerative/recuperative cycle stationary combustion turbine, any  combined cycle combustion turbine, and any combined heat and power  combustion turbine based system. Stationary means that the combustion  turbine is not self propelled or intended to be propelled while  performing its function. It may, however, be mounted on a vehicle for  portability.</p><p class="depth0">Unit operating day means a 24-hour period between 12 midnight and  the following midnight during which any fuel is combusted at any time in  the unit. It is not necessary for fuel to be combusted continuously for  the entire 24-hour period.</p><p class="depth0">Unit operating hour means a clock hour during which any fuel is  combusted in the affected unit. If the unit combusts fuel for the entire  clock hour, it is considered to be a full unit operating hour. If the  unit combusts fuel for only part of the clock hour, it is considered to  be a partial unit operating hour.</p><p class="depth0">Useful thermal output means the thermal energy made available for  use in any industrial or commercial process, or used in any heating or  cooling application, i.e., total thermal energy made available for  processes and applications other than electrical or mechanical  generation. Thermal output for this subpart means the energy in  recovered thermal output measured against the energy in the thermal  output at 15 degrees Celsius and 101.325 kilopascals of pressure.
