                            <p class="depth0">Congress, in authorizing the exploration for hard mineral resources under the Act, also enacted provisions relating to the protection of the marine environment from the effects of exploration activities. For example, before the Administrator may issue a license, pursuant to section 105(a)(4) of the Act

he must find that the exploration proposed in an application cannot reasonably be expected to result in a significant adverse effect on the quality of the environment. Also, the Act requires in section 109(b) that each license issued by the Administrator must contain such terms, conditions and restrictions which prescribe the actions the licensee must take in the conduct of exploration activities to assure protection of the environment. Furthermore, the Act in section 105(c)(1)(B) provides for the modification by the Administrator of any term, condition or restriction if relevant data and other information indicates that modification is required to protect the quality of the environment. In addition, section 114 of the Act specifies that each license issued under the Act must require the licensee to monitor the environmental effects of the exploration activities in accordance with guidelines issued by the Administrator, and to submit such information as the Administrator finds to be necessary and appropriate to assess environmental impacts and to develop and evaluate possible methods of mitigating adverse environmental effects.</p>
