The preferred microphone height on flat terrain is 4 feet (1.2 m).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the sound level measurement system is hand-held or otherwise monitored by a person located near its microphone, the holder must orient himself/herself relative to the highway in a manner consistent with the recommendation of the manufacturer of the sound level measurement system. In no case shall the holder or observer be closer than 2 feet (.6 m) from the system's microphone, nor shall he/she locate himself/herself between the microphone and the vehicle being measured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The microphone of the sound level measurement system shall be oriented toward the vehicle at an angle that is consistent with the recommendation of the system's manufacturer. If the manufacturer of the system does not recommend an angle of orientation for its microphone, the microphone shall be oriented at an angle of not less than 70 degrees and not more than perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the test site at the microphone target point.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The sound level measurement system shall be set to the A-weighting network and ``fast'' meter response mode.
