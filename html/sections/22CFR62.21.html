The Department of State may, in its sole discretion, designate bona fide programs which offer foreign nationals the opportunity to

A person participating in the Exchange Visitor Program under this section shall satisfy the definition of a short-term scholar as set forth in Sec. 62.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cross-cultural activities and orientation. Due to the nature of such exchanges, sponsors of programs for short-term scholars shall be exempted from the requirements of providing cross-cultural activities and orientation as set forth in Sec. 62.8(d) and Sec. 62.10(c). However, sponsors are encouraged to provide such programs for short-term scholars whenever appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Location of exchange. The short-term scholar shall participate in the Exchange Visitor Program at the conferences, workshops, seminars, or other events or activities stated on his or her Form DS-2019.
