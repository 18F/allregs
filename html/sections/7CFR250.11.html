Distributing agencies shall impose upon welfare agencies the responsibility for determining that recipients to whom welfare agencies distribute donated foods are eligible: Provided, however: That the State agency or FNSRO administering the applicable program shall determine the eligibility under this part of school food authorities participating under part 210 or part 220, or sponsors participating in the Summer Food Service Program for Children under part 225, of this chapter, and of nonresidential child care institutions participating in the Child Care Food Program under part 226 of this chapter.</p>
