                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Commission may use administrative wage garnishment for debts, including those referred to Financial Management Service, Department of Treasury, for cross-servicing. Regulations in 31 CFR 285.11 govern the collection of delinquent nontax debts owed to federal agencies through administrative garnishment of non-Federal wages. Whenever the Financial Management Service collects such a debt for the Commission using administrative wage garnishment, the statutory administrative requirements in 31 CFR 285.11 will govern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hearing official. Any hearing required to establish the Commission's right to collect a debt through administrative wage garnishment shall be conducted by a qualified individual selected at the discretion of the Chairman of the Commission, as specified in 31 CFR 285.11.
