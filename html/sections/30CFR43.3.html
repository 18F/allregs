Specifically, subpart B details the steps to be taken by a representative of miners or a miner in making a request for a special inspection and by the Secretary in processing and taking action on such a request under section 103(g)(1). Subpart C sets forth informal review procedures which a representative of miners or a miner may request under sections 103 (g)(1) and (g)(2) where no citation or order is issued under those sections.</p>
