Except as provided in paragraph (d) of  this section, the reporting of the overpayment on an adjusted return  constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the  adjusted return is filed before the expiration of the period of  limitations on credit or refund.

Employee tax imposed  by section 3101 with respect to tips reported by an employee to his  employer and collected by the employer from funds turned over by the  employee to the employer (see section 3102(c)) shall be treated, for  purposes of this paragraph, as employee tax deducted from wages received  by the employee. If the employee is required to file an income tax  return for   such calendar year (or for his last taxable year beginning in such  calendar year) he may obtain the benefit of the special refund only by  claiming credit as provided in Sec. 1.31-2 of this chapter (Income Tax  Regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employee A in the calendar year 1968 receives taxable  wages in the amount of $5,000 from each of his employers, B, C, and D,  for services performed during such year (or at any time after 1936), or  a total of $15,000. Employee tax (computed at 4.4 percent, the aggregate  employee tax rate in effect in 1968) is deducted from A's wages in the  amount of $220 by B and $220 by C, or a total of $440. Employer D pays  employee tax in the amount of $220 without deducting such tax from A's  wages. The employee tax with respect to the first $7,800 of such wages  is $343.20. A is entitled to a special refund of $96.80 ($440 minus  $343.20). The $5,000 of wages received from employer D and the $220 of  employee tax paid with respect thereto have no bearing in computing A's  special refund since such tax was not deducted from his wages.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Employee E in the calendar year 1968 performs services  for employers F and G, for which E is entitled to wages of $7,800 from  each employer, or a total of $15,600. On account of such services, E in  1967 received an advance payment of $1,800 of wages from F; and in 1968,  receives wages in the amount of $6,000 from F and $7,800 from G.  Employee tax was deducted as follows: In 1967, $79.20 ($1,800 x 4.4  percent, the aggregate employee tax rate in effect in 1967) by employer  F; and in 1968, $264.00 ($6,000 x 4.4 percent, the aggregate employee  tax rate in effect in 1968) by employer F, and $343.20 ($7,800 x 4.4  percent) by employer G. Thus, E in the calendar year 1968 received  $13,800 in wages from which $607.20 of employee tax was deducted. The  amount of employee tax with respect to the first $7,800 of such wages  received in 1968 is $343.20. E is entitled to a special refund of  $264.00 ($607.20 minus $343.20). The $1,800 advance of wages received in  1967 from F, and the $79.20 of employee tax with respect thereto, have  no bearing in computing E's special refund for 1968, because the wages  were not received in 1968. Such amounts could not form the basis for a  special refund unless E during 1967 received from F and at least one  more employer wages totaling more than $6,600.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Federal employees. For purposes of special refunds of employee  tax, each head of a Federal agency or of a wholly owned instrumentality  of the United States who makes a return pursuant to section 3122 (and  each agent designated by a head of a Federal agency or instrumentality  who makes a return pursuant to such section) is considered a separate  employer. For such purposes, the term ``wages'' includes the amount  which each such head (or agent) determines to constitute wages paid an  employee, but not in excess of the amount specified in paragraph  (a)(1)(i) (a) through (h) of this section for the calendar year in  question. For example, if wages received by an employee during calendar  year 1974 are reportable by two or more agents of one or more Federal  agencies and the amount of such wages is in excess of $13,200 the  employee shall be entitled to a special refund of the amount, if any, by  which the employee tax imposed with respect to such wages and deducted  therefrom exceeds the employee tax with respect to the first $13,200 of  such wages. Moreover, if an employee receives wages during any calendar  year from an agency or wholly owned instrumentality of the United States  and from one or more other employers, either private or governmental,  the total amount of such wages shall be taken into account for purposes  of the special refund provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> State employees. For purposes of special refunds of employee  tax, the term ``wages'' includes such remuneration for services covered  by an agreement made pursuant to section 218 of the Social Security Act,  relating to voluntary agreements for coverage of employees of State and  local governments, as would be wages if such services constituted  employment (see Sec. 31.3121(a)-1, relating to wages); the term  ``employer'' includes a State or any political subdivision thereof, or  any instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing; and the term  ``tax'' or ``tax imposed by section 3101'' includes an amount equivalent  to the employee tax which would be imposed by section 3101 if such  services constituted employment. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of  this section are applicable whether or not any amount deducted from an  employee's remuneration as a result of an agreement made pursuant to  section 218 of the Social Security Act has been paid pursuant to   such agreement. Thus, the special refund provisions are applicable to  amounts equivalent to employee tax deducted from employees' remuneration  by States, political subdivisions, or instrumentalities by reason of  agreements made under section 218 of the Social Security Act. Moreover,  if during any calendar year an employee receives remuneration for  services covered by such an agreement and during the same calendar year  receives wages from one or more other employers, either private or  governmental, the total amount of such remuneration and wages shall be  taken into account for purposes of the special refund provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Employees of certain foreign corporations. For purposes of  special refunds of employee tax, the term ``wages'' includes such  remuneration for services covered by an agreement made pursuant to  section 3121(l), relating to agreements for coverage of employees of  certain foreign corporations, as would be wages if such services  constituted employment (see Sec. 31.3121(a)-1, relating to wages); the  term ``employer'' includes any domestic corporation which has entered  into an agreement pursuant to section 3121(l); and the term ``tax'' or  ``tax imposed by section 3101'' includes, in the case of services  covered by an agreement entered into pursuant to section 3121(l), an  amount equivalent to the employee tax which would be imposed by section  3101 if such services constituted employment. The provisions of  paragraph (a)(1) of this section are applicable whether or not any  amount deducted from the employee's remuneration by reason of such  agreement has been paid to the district director. Thus, the special  refund provisions are applicable to amounts equivalent to employee tax  deducted from employees' remuneration by reason of agreements made under  section 3121(l). A domestic corporation which enters into an agreement  pursuant to section 3121(l) shall, for purposes of this paragraph, be  considered an employer in its capacity as a party to such agreement  separate and distinct from its identity as an employer employing  individuals on its own account (see section 3121(l)(9)). If during any  calendar year an employee receives remuneration for services covered by  such an agreement and during the same calendar year receives wages for  services in employment, the total amount of such remuneration and wages  shall be taken into account for purposes of the special refund  provisions. For provisions relating to agreements entered into under  section 3121(l), see the regulations in part 36 of this chapter  (Regulations on Contract Coverage of Employees of Foreign Subsidiaries).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Governmental employees in American Samoa. For purposes of  special refunds of employee tax, the Governor of American Samoa and each  agent designated by him who makes a return pursuant to section 3125(b)  (see Sec. 31.3125) is considered a separate employer. For such purposes,  the term ``wages'' includes the amount which the Governor (or any agent)  determines to constitute wages paid an employee, but not in excess of  the amount specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) (a) through (h) of this  section for the calendar year in question. For example, if wages  received by an employee during calendar year 1974 are reportable by two  or more agents pursuant to section 3125(b) and the total amount of such  wages is in excess of $13,200, the employee shall be entitled to a  special refund of the amount, if any, by which the employee tax imposed  with respect to such wages and deducted therefrom exceeds the employee  tax with respect to the first $13,200 of such wages. Moreover, if an  employee receives wages during any calendar year from the Government of  American Samoa, from a political subdivision thereof, or from any  wholly-owned instrumentality of such government or political subdivision  and from one or more other employers, either private or governmental,  the total amount of such wages shall be taken into account for purposes  of the special refund provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Governmental employees in the District of Columbia. For purposes  of special refunds of employee tax, the Commissioner of the District of  Columbia (or, prior to the transfer of functions pursuant to  Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (81 Stat. 948), the Commissioners of  the District of Columbia) and each agent designated by him who   makes a return pursuant to section 3125(c) (see Sec. 31.3125) is  considered a separate employer. For such purposes, the term ``wages''  includes the amount which the Commissioner (or any agent) determines to  constitute wages paid an employee, but not in excess of the amount  specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) (a) through (h) of this section for the  calendar year in question. For example, if wages received by an employee  during calendar year 1974 are reportable by two or more agents pursuant  to section 3125(c) and the total amount of such wages is in excess of  $13,200 the employee shall be entitled to a special refund of the  amount, if any, by which the employee tax imposed with respect to such  wages and deducted therefrom exceeds the employee tax imposed with  respect to such wages and deducted therefrom exceeds the employee tax  with respect to the first $13,200 of such wages. Moreover, if an  employee receives wages during any calendar year from the Government of  the District of Columbia or from a wholly-owned instrumentality thereof  and from one or more other employers, either private or governmental,  the total amount of such wages shall be taken into account for purposes  of the special refund provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Claims for special refund--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An employee who is  entitled to a special refund under section 6413(c) may claim such refund  under the provisions of this section only if the employee is not  entitled to claim the amount thereof as a credit against income tax as  provided in Sec. 1.31-2 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations). Each  claim under this section shall be made with respect to wages received  within one calendar year (regardless of the year or years after 1936  during which the services were performed for which such wages are  received), and shall be filed after the close of such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form of claim. Each claim for special refund under this section  shall be made on Form 843, in accordance with the regulations in this  subpart and the instructions relating to such form. In the case of a  claim filed prior to April 15, 1968, the claim shall be filed with the  district director for the internal revenue district in which the  employee resides or, if the employee does not reside in any internal  revenue district, with the District Director, Baltimore, Md. 21202.  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6091-1 (relating to  hand-carried documents), in the case of a claim filed after April 14,  1968, the claim shall be filed with the service center serving such  internal revenue district. However, in the case of an employee who does  not reside in any internal revenue district and who is outside the  United States, the claim shall be filed with the Director of  International Operations, U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Washington,  D.C. 20225, unless the employee resides in Puerto Rico or the Virgin  Islands, in which case the claim shall be filed with the Director of  International Operations, U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Hato Rey, P.R.  00917. The claim shall include the employee's account number and the  following information with respect to each employer from whom he  received wages during the calendar year: (i) The name and address of  such employer, (ii) the amount of wages received during the calendar  year to which the claim relates, and (iii) the amount of employee tax  collected by the employer from the employee with respect to such wages.  Other information may be required but should be submitted only upon  request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Period of limitation. For the period of limitation upon special  refund of employee tax imposed by section 3101, see Sec. 301.6511(a)-1  of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and this section with respect to  the hospital insurance tax imposed by section 3101(b), be treated as  wages (as defined by section 3121(a)) received from an employer with   respect to which the hospital insurance tax imposed by section 3101(b)  was deducted. For purposes of this section, compensation received shall  be determined under the principles provided in chapter 22 of the Code  and the regulations thereunder (see section 3231(e) and Sec. 31.3231(e)- 1). Therefore, compensation paid for time lost shall be deemed earned  and received for purposes of this section in the month in which such  time is lost, and compensation which is earned during the period for  which a return of taxes under chapter 22 is required to be made and  which is payable during the calendar month following such period shall  be deemed to have been received for purposes of this section during such  period only. Further, compensation is deemed to have been earned and  received when an employee or employee representative performs services  for which he is paid, or for which there is a present or future  obligation to pay, regardless of the time at which payment is made or  deemed to be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example.

A also earned and received wages in 1973 from employer Y, which  were subject to the employee tax under the Federal Insurance  Contributions Act, in the amount of $6,000. A paid hospital insurance  tax on $13,800 ($7,800 compensation from X including $650 earned and  deemed received in December 1973 but paid in January 1974 and not  including $550 paid in January 1973 but earned and deemed received in  December 1972, $6,000 compensation from Y) received or deemed received  or earned in 1973. For purposes of the hospital insurance tax imposed by  section 3101(b), these amounts are all wages received from an employer  in 1973. Therefore, A is entitled to a special refund for 1973 under  section 6413(c) and this section of $30 (1.0% x $13,800 - 1.0% x  $10,800).
