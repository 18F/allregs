                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(10)</em> and 13(b)(5) from all or part of the minimum wage  and overtime pay requirements are not applicable to the child labor  provisions. This exemption, it will be noted, is limited to periods  outside of school hours in contrast to the complete exemption for  employment in ``agriculture'' under the wage and hours provisions. Under  the original act, the exemption became operative whenever the applicable  State law did not require the minor to attend school. The legislative  history clearly indicates that in amending this provision, Congress  sought to establish a clearer and simpler test for permissive employment  which could be applied without the necessity of exploring State legal  requirements regarding school attendance in the particular State. It  recognized that the original provision fell short of achieving the  objective of permitting agricultural work only so long as it did not  infringe upon the opportunity of children for education. By recasting  the exemption on an ``outside of school hours'' basis, Congress intended  to provide a test which could be more effectively applied toward  carrying out this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The applicability of the exemption to employment in agriculture  as defined in section 3(f) \32\ of the Act depends in general upon  whether such employment conflict with school hours for the locality  where the child lives. Since the phrase ``school hours'' is not defined  in the Act, it must be given the meaning that it has in ordinary speech.  Moreover, it will be noted that the statute speaks of school hours ``for  the school district'' rather than for the individual child. Thus, the  provision does not depend for its application upon the individual  student's requirements for attendance at school. For example, if an  individual student is excused from his studies for a day or a part of a  day by the superintendent or the school board, the exemption would not  apply if school was in session then. ``Outside of school hours''  generally may be said to refer to such periods as before or after school  hours, holidays, summer vacation, Sundays, or any other days on which  the school for the district in which the minor lives does not assemble.  Since ``school hours for the school district'' do not apply to minors  who have graduated from high school, the entire year would be considered  ``outside of school hours'' and, therefore, their employment in  agriculture would be permitted at any time. While it is the position of  the Department that a minor who leaves one district where schools are  closed and who moves into and lives in another district where schools  are in session may not work during the hours that schools are in session  in the new district, it will not be asserted that this position prevents  the employment of a minor in a district where schools are in session, if  the school last attended by the minor has closed for summer vacation. As  a reasonable precaution, however, no employer should employ a child  under such circumstances before May 15, and after that date he should do  so only if he is shown by the minor satisfactory evidence in the form of  a written statement signed by a school official stating that the school  with which he is connected is the one last attended by the minor and  that the school is closed for summer vacation. Such statement should  contain the minor's name, the name and address of the school, the date  the school closed for the current year, the date the statement was  signed, and the title of the school official signing the statement. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\32\ Agriculture as defined in section 3(f) includes ``farming in  all its branches and among other things includes the cultivation and  tillage of the soil, dairying, the production, cultivation, growing, and  harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodities (including  commodities defined as agricultural commodities in section 15(g) of the  Agricultural Marketing Act, as amended), the raising of livestock, bees,  fur-bearing animals, or poultry, and any practices (including any  forestry, or lumbering operations) performed by a farmer or on a farm as  an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, including  preparation for market, delivery to storage or to market or to carriers  for transportation to market.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Attention is directed to the fact that by virtue of the parental  exemption provided in section 3(1) of the Act, children under 16 years  of age are permitted to work, for their parents on their parents' farms  at any time provided they are not employed in a manufacturing or mining  occupation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The orders (subpart E of this part) declaring certain  occupations to be particularly hazardous for the employment of minors  between 16 and 18 years of age or detrimental to their health or well- being do not apply to employment in agriculture, pending study as to the  hazardous or detrimental nature of occupations in agriculture. \33\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\33\ See note to subpart E of this part.
