                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)-(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Non-affiliation. For purposes of the Small Business Act, a  Protege firm may not be considered an affiliate of a mentor firm solely  on the basis that the Protege firm is receiving developmental assistance  referred to in paragraph (m) of this section, from such mentor firm  under the Mentor-Protege Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> General policy. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Eligible contractors, not included on the  ``System for Award Management Exclusions'' that are approved as mentors  will enter into agreements with eligible Proteges. Mentors provide  appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of  Proteges to perform as contractors or subcontractors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A firm's status as a Protege under a Treasury contract shall not  have an effect on the firm's eligibility to seek other contracts or  subcontracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Incentives for contractor participation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under the Small  Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(E), Treasury is authorized to provide  appropriate incentives in negotiated contractual actions to encourage  subcontracting opportunities consistent with the efficient and  economical performance of the contract. Proposed mentor-Protege efforts  will be considered during the evaluation of such negotiated, competitive  offers. Contracting Officers may provide, as an incentive, a bonus  score, not to exceed 5% of the relative importance assigned to the non- price factors. If this incentive is used, the Contracting Officer shall  include language in the solicitation indicating that this adjustment may  occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Before awarding a contract that requires a subcontracting plan,  the existence of a mentor-Protege arrangement, and performance (if any)  under such an existing arrangement, will be considered by the  Contracting Officer in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Evaluating the quality of a proposed subcontracting plan under  FAR 19.705-4; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Evaluating the contractor compliance with the subcontracting  plans submitted in previous contracts as a factor in determining  contractor responsibility under FAR 19.705-5(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization  (OSDBU) Mentoring Award is a non-monetary award that will be presented  (annually on a fiscal year basis or as often as is appropriate) to the  mentoring firm providing the most effective developmental support of a  Protege. The Mentor-Protege Program Manager will recommend an award  winner to the Director, OSDBU.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Mentor firms. A mentor firm may be either a large or small  business, eligible for award of a Government contract that can provide  developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of Proteges to  perform as subcontractors. Mentors will be encouraged to enter into  arrangements with Proteges in addition to firms with whom they   have established business relationships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Protege firms. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For selection as a Protege, a firm must be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A small business, women-owned small business, small  disadvantaged business, small business owned and controlled by veteran  or service disabled veteran, or qualified HUBZone small business, or a  qualified 8(a) concern;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Qualified as a small business under the NAICS code for the  services or supplies to be provided by the Protege under its subcontract  to the mentor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Eligible for award of Government contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except small disadvantaged businesses and qualified HUBZone  small business firms, a Protege firm may self-certify to a mentor firm  that it meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (h)(1) of this  section. Mentors may rely in good faith on written representations by  potential Proteges that they meet the specified eligibility  requirements. The h(1)(i), small disadvantaged business, or qualified  HUBZone small business status eligibility and documentation requirements  are determined according to FAR 19.304 and 19.1303, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Proteges may not have multiple mentors unless approved, in  writing, by the Director, OSDBU. Proteges participating in other agency  mentor Protege programs in addition to the Treasury Mentor-Protege  Program should maintain a system for preparing separate reports of  mentoring activity for each agency's program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Selection of Protege firms. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mentor firms will be solely  responsible for selecting Protege firms. The mentor is encouraged to  identify and select the types of Protege firms listed in 1019.202-70(h).  Mentor firms may have multiple Proteges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The selection of Protege firms by mentor firms may not be  protested. Any question regarding the size or eligibility status of an  entity selected by a mentor to be a Protege must be referred solely to  Treasury's OSDBU for resolution. Treasury, at its discretion, may seek  an advisory opinion from the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Application process for mentor firms to participate in the  program. (1) Firms interested in becoming a mentor firm may apply in  writing to Treasury's OSDBU. The application will be evaluated based  upon the description of the nature and extent of technical and  managerial support proposed as well as the extent of other developmental  assistance in the form of equity investment, loans, joint-venture  support and traditional subcontracting support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> OSDBU review and approval process of agreement. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> OSDBU will  review the information specified in 1019.202-70(l). The OSDBU review  will be completed no later than 30 calendar days after receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upon completion of the review, the mentor may implement the  developmental assistance program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An approved agreement will be incorporated into the mentor  firm's contract(s) with Treasury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If OSDBU disapproves the agreement, the mentor may provide  additional information for reconsideration. Upon finding deficiencies  that OSDBU considers correctable, OSDBU will notify the mentor and  provide a list of defects. Any additional information or corrections  requested will be provided within 30 calendar days. The review of any  supplemental material will be completed within 30 calendar days after  receipt by OSDBU. When submission of additional data is required during  a proposal evaluation for a new contract award, shorter timeframes for  submission, review and re-evaluation for approval may be authorized by  OSDBU.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The agreement defines the relationship between the mentor and  Protege firms only. The agreement itself does not create any privity of  contract between the mentor or Protege and Treasury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Agreement contents. The contents of the agreement will contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Names and addresses of mentor and Protege firms and a point of  contact within both firms who will oversee the agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Procedures for the mentor firm to notify the Protege firm, OSDBU  and the Contracting Officer, in writing, at least 30 days in advance of  the mentor   firm's intent to voluntarily withdraw from the Mentor-Protege Program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procedures for a Protege firm to notify the mentor firm in  writing at least 30 days in advance of the Protege firm's intent to  voluntarily terminate the mentor-Protege agreement. The mentor must  notify OSDBU and the Contracting Officer immediately upon receipt of  such notice from the Protege;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each proposed mentor-Protege relationship must include  information on the mentor's ability to provide developmental assistance  to the Protege and how that assistance will potentially increase  contracting and subcontracting opportunities for the Protege firm;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A description of the type of developmental program that will be  provided by the mentor firm to the Protege firm, to include a  description of the potential subcontract work, and a schedule for  providing assistance and criteria for evaluation of the Proteges  developmental success;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A listing of the types and dollar amounts of subcontracts that  may be awarded to the Protege firm;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Program participation term;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Termination procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Plan for accomplishing work should the agreement be terminated;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Other terms and conditions, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Developmental assistance. The forms of developmental assistance  a mentor can provide to a Protege include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Management guidance relating to financial management,  organizational management, overall business management/planning,  business development, and technical assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Loans;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rent-free use of facilities and/or equipment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Temporary assignment of personnel to Protege for purpose of  training; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Any other types of mutually beneficial assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Obligation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mentor or Protege firms may voluntarily withdraw  from the Mentor-Protege Program. However, such withdrawal shall not  excuse the contractor from compliance with contract requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At the conclusion of each year in the Mentor-Protege Program,  the contractor and Protege must formally brief the Department of the  Treasury team regarding program accomplishments as they pertain to the  approved agreement. Individual briefings may be conducted, at the  request of either party.
