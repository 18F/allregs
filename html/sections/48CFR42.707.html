                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cost-sharing arrangements, when authorized, may call for the  contractor to participate in the costs of the contract by accepting  indirect cost rates lower than the anticipated actual rates. In such  cases, a negotiated indirect cost rate ceiling may be incorporated into  the contract for prospective application. For cost sharing under  research and development contracts, see 35.003(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Other situations may make it prudent to provide a final  indirect cost rate ceiling in a contract. Examples of such circumstances  are when the proposed contractor--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is a new or recently reorganized company, and there is no past  or recent record of incurred indirect costs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has a recent record of a rapidly increasing indirect cost rate  due to a declining volume of sales without a commensurate decline in  indirect expenses; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Seeks to enhance its competitive position in a particular  circumstance by basing its proposal on indirect cost rates lower than  those that may reasonably be expected to occur during contract  performance, thereby causing a cost overrun.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In such cases, an equitable ceiling covering the final indirect  cost rates may be negotiated and specified in the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When ceiling provisions are utilized, the contract shall also  provide that (1) the Government will not be obligated to pay any  additional amount should the final indirect cost rates exceed the  negotiated ceiling rates and, (2) in the event the final indirect cost  rates are less than the negotiated ceiling rates, the negotiated rates  will be reduced to conform with the lower rates.</p>
