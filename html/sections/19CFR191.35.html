                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice. A notice of intent to export merchandise which may be the subject of an unused merchandise drawback claim (19 U.S.C. 1313(j)) must be provided to the Customs Service to give Customs the opportunity to examine the merchandise. The claimant, or the exporter, must file at the port of intended examination a Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback on Customs Form 7553 at least 2 working days prior to the date of intended exportation unless Customs approves another filing period or the claimant has been granted a waiver of prior notice (see Sec. 191.91 of this part).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required Information. The notice shall certify that the merchandise has not been used in the United States before exportation. In addition, the notice shall provide the bill of lading number, if known, the name and telephone number, mailing address, and, if available, fax number and e-mail address of a contact person, and the location of the merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Decision to examine or to waive examination. Within two (2) working days after receipt of the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback (see paragraph (a) of this section), Customs will notify the party designated on the Notice in writing of Customs decision to either examine the merchandise to be exported, or to waive examination. If Customs timely notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to examine the merchandise (see paragraph (d) of this section), but the merchandise is exported without having been presented to Customs for examination, any drawback claim, or part thereof, based on the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback shall be denied. If Customs notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to waive examination of the merchandise, or, if timely notification of a decision by Customs to examine or to waive examination is absent, the merchandise may be exported without delay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time and place of examination. If Customs gives timely notice of its decision to examine the export merchandise, the merchandise to be examined shall be promptly presented to Customs. Customs shall examine the merchandise within five (5) working days after presentation of the merchandise. The merchandise may be exported without examination if Customs fails to timely examine the merchandise after presentation to Customs. If the examination is completed at a port other than the port of actual exportation, the merchandise shall be transported in-bond to the port of exportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Extent of examination. The appropriate Customs office may permit release of merchandise without examination, or may examine routinely (to the extent determined to be necessary) the items exported.</p>
