                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)-(d)</em>, notify the Director, Office of  Protected Resources, NMFS, or designee, by telephone (301-427-8400),  within 24 hours of the discovery of the injured or dead animal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Holders of Letters of Authorization must designate trained,  qualified, on-site individuals approved in advance by NMFS, as specified  in the Letter of Authorization, to perform the following monitoring  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For NEODS testing, areas to be used in missions shall be  visually monitored for marine mammal presence from a surface support  vessel prior to detonation of mine neutralization charges. Monitoring  shall be conducted 30 minutes before missions to clear the mitigation- monitoring zone. Post-mission monitoring shall also be conducted for 30  minutes after the final detonation (concentrated on the area down  current of the test site). If marine mammals are inside the mitigation- monitoring zone, detonations shall be postponed until they have left the  area. The observer on the vessel must be equipped with the proper  optical equipment and lines of communication in order to recommend the  decision to move forward with the mission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Monitoring shall occur pre-mission (for 30 minutes), throughout  the mission, and post-mission (for 30 minutes). Post-mission monitoring  shall concentrate on the area down current of the test site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Survey clearance procedures shall be conducted using best  operational methods possible. After the mitigation-monitoring zone is  cleared, all dolphins and protected species indicators (e.g., Sargassum  rafts) shall be avoided to the maximum extent possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Clearance procedures shall be re-conducted if dolphins or  protected species indicators (e.g., Sargassum rafts) are encountered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> After conducting post-mission monitoring, NEODS training  operations data as required by Eglin Air Force Base's Natural Resources  Section, 96 CEG/CEVSN shall be reported. Post-mission monitoring shall  commence immediately following each detonation and shall be concentrated  on the area down current of the test site. If any injured or dead marine  mammals are observed, that information will be reported and coordinated  with marine animals stranding networks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An annual summary (coordinated through 96 CEG/CEVSN) of mission  observations shall be submitted to: NMFS, Southeast Regional Office,  Protected Resources Division, 9721 Executive Center Drive North, St.  Petersburg, Florida 33702; and NMFS, Office   of Protected Resources, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland  20910.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Holders of Letters of Authorization must conduct additional  monitoring as required under an annual Letter of Authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Holders of Letters of Authorization must submit an annual report  summarizing the specified activity as well as monitoring and mitigation  data to the Southeast Regional Administrator and Director of the Office  of Protected Resources, NMFS, within 90 days after the conclusion of the  NEODS training operations. This report must contain the following  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Date(s), time(s), and location(s) of explosive activities,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Design of the monitoring program,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Results of the monitoring program including, but not necessarily  limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Species counts,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Numbers of observed disturbances,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Descriptions of the disturbance behaviors before, during, and  after explosive activities,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Bearing and distances,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Observations of unusual behaviors, numbers, or distributions of  marine mammals in the activity area shall be reported to NMFS and the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service so that any potential follow-up  observations can be conducted by the appropriate personnel. In addition,  observations of tag-bearing marine mammals, sea turtles, and fish  carcasses as well as any rare or unusual species of marine mammals and  fish shall be reported to NMFS and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An annual report (referred to in Sec.  217.85(d)) must be  submitted at the time of notification of the renewal of the Letter of  Authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A draft comprehensive final report must be submitted at least  180 days prior to expiration of these regulations. This comprehensive  technical report shall provide full documentation of methods, results,  and interpretation of all monitoring during the first four and a half  years of the Letter of Authorization. A revised final comprehensive  technical report, including all monitoring results during the entire  period of the Letters of Authorization, must be submitted 90 days after  the end of the period of effectiveness of the regulations. This report  shall summarize the activities undertaken and the results reported in  all previous reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the unanticipated event that the specified activity  clearly causes the take of a marine mammal in a manner prohibited by a  Letter of Authorization, such as an injury, serious injury, or  mortality, Eglin Air Force Base will immediately cease the specified  activities and immediately report the incident to the Chief of the  Permits and Conservation Division, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS  at 301-427-8401 and/or by email to Jolie.Harrison@noaa.gov and  Howard.Goldstein@noaa.gov, and the NMFS Southeast Regional Marine Mammal  Stranding Network at 877-433-8299 (Blair.Mase@noaa.gov and  Erin.Fougeres@noaa.gov) (Florida Marine Mammal Stranding Hotline at 888- 404-3922). The report must include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Time, date, and location (latitude/longitude) of the incident;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Description of the incident;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Status of all noise-generating source use in the 24 hours  preceding the incident;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Water depth;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Environmental conditions (e.g., wind speed and direction,  Beaufort sea state, cloud cover, and visibility);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Description of all marine mammal observations in the 24 hours  preceding the incident;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Species identification or description of the animal(s)  involved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Fate of the animal(s); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Photographs or video footage of the animal(s) (if equipment is  available).</p><p class="depth4">Activities shall not resume until NMFS is able to review the  circumstances of the prohibited take. NMFS shall work with Eglin Air  Force Base to determine what is necessary to minimize the likelihood of  further prohibited take and ensure MMPA compliance. Eglin Air Force Base  may not resume their activities until notified by NMFS via letter or  email, or telephone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event that Eglin Air Force Base discovers an injured or  dead marine mammal, and the lead observer determines that the cause of  injury or death is unknown and the death is relatively recent (i.e.,  less than a moderate state of decomposition as described in the next  paragraph), Eglin Air Force Base will immediately report the incident to  the Chief of the Permits and Conservation Division, Office of Protected  Resources, NMFS, at 301-427-8401, and/or by email to  Jolie.Harrison@noaa.gov and Howard.Goldstein@noaa.gov and the NMFS  Southeast Region Marine Mammal Stranding Network (877-433-8299) and/or  by email to the Southeast Regional Stranding Coordinator  (Blair.Mase@noaa.gov) and Southeast Regional Stranding Program  Administrator (Erin.Fougeres@noaa.gov). The report must include the same  information identified in the paragraph above. Activities may continue  while NMFS reviews the circumstances of the incident, NMFS will work  with Eglin Air Force Base to determine whether modifications in the  activities are appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event that Eglin Air Force Base discovers an injured or  dead marine mammal, and the lead observer determines that the injury or  death is not associated with or related to the activities authorized in  the Letter of Authorization (e.g., previously wounded animal, carcass  with moderate to advanced decomposition, or scavenger damage), Eglin Air  Force Base will report the incident to the Chief of the Permits and  Conservation Division, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, at 301-427- 8401, and/or by email to Jolie.Harrison@noaa.gov and  Howard.Goldstein@noaa.gov, and the NMFS Southeast Regional Marine Mammal  Stranding Network (877-433-8299), and/or by email to the Southeast  Regional Stranding Coordinator (Blair.Mase@noaa.gov) and Southeast  Regional Stranding Program Administrator (Erin.Fougeres@noaa.gov),  within 24 hours of discovery. Eglin Air Force Base will provide  photographs or video footage (if available) or other documentation of  the stranded animals sighting to NMFS and the Marine Mammal Stranding  Network.</p>
