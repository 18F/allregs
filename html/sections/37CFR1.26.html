                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Director may refund any fee paid by mistake or in excess of that required. A change of purpose after the payment of a fee, such as when a party desires to withdraw a patent filing for which the fee was paid, including an application, an appeal, or a request for an oral hearing, will not entitle a party to a refund of such fee. The Office will not refund amounts of twenty-five dollars or less unless a refund is specifically requested, and will not notify the payor of such amounts. If a party paying a fee or requesting a refund does not provide the banking information necessary for making refunds by electronic funds transfer (31 U.S.C. 3332 and 31 CFR part 208), or instruct the Office

that refunds are to be credited to a deposit account, the Director may require such information, or use the banking information on the payment instrument to make a refund. Any refund of a fee paid by credit card will be by a credit to the credit card account to which the fee was charged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any request for refund must be filed within two years from the date the fee was paid, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph or in Sec.  1.28(a). If the Office charges a deposit account by an amount other than an amount specifically indicated in an authorization (Sec.  1.25(b)), any request for refund based upon such charge must be filed within two years from the date of the deposit account statement indicating such charge, and include a copy of that deposit account statement. The time periods set forth in this paragraph are not extendable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the Director decides not to institute a reexamination proceeding in response to a request for reexamination or supplemental examination, fees paid with the request for reexamination or supplemental examination will be refunded or returned in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section. The reexamination requester or the patent owner who requested a supplemental examination proceeding, as appropriate, should indicate the form in which any refund should be made (e.g., by check, electronic funds transfer, credit to a deposit account). Generally, refunds will be issued in the form that the original payment was provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For an ex parte reexamination request, the ex parte reexamination filing fee paid by the reexamination requester, less the fee set forth in Sec.  1.20(c)(7), will be refunded to the requester if the Director decides not to institute an ex parte reexamination proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For an inter partes reexamination request, a refund of $7,970 will be made to the reexamination requester if the Director decides not to institute an inter partes reexamination proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For a supplemental examination request, the fee for reexamination ordered as a result of supplemental examination, as set forth in Sec.  1.20(k)(2), will be returned to the patent owner who requested the supplemental examination proceeding if the Director decides not to institute a reexamination proceeding.
