                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. Consistent with the OAS Model Regulations, BIS requires from all OAS member countries an Import Certificate issued by the government of the importing country for items classified as ECCNs 0A984, 0A986, or 0A987. For those OAS member countries that have not yet established or implemented an Import Certificate procedure, BIS will accept an equivalent official document (e.g., import license or letter of authorization) issued by the government of the importing country as supporting documentation for the export of firearms. This section describes the requirements for Import Certificates or official equivalents in support of license applications submitted to BIS for firearms items that are identified by ``FC Column 1'' in the ``License Requirements'' section of the Commerce Control List.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Import Certificate Procedure. An Import Certificate or equivalent official document must be obtained from the government of the importing OAS member country for firearms items classified as ECCNs 0A984, 0A986, or 0A987. Except as provided by Sec. 748.9(a) of the EAR, the applicant must obtain and retain on file either the original or certified copy of the Import Certificate, or an original or certified copy of equivalent official document issued by the government of the importing country in support of any license application for export of firearms items classified as 0A984, 0A986, or 0A987. All the recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR apply to this requirement. The applicant must clearly note the number and date of the Import Certificate or equivalent official document on all export license applications (BIS

Form 748P, Multipurpose Application Form, Block 13) supported by that Certificate or equivalent official document. The applicant must also indicate in Block 7 of the application that the Certificate or equivalent official document has been received and will be retained on file. However, the applicant may submit an application before obtaining the original or certified copy of the Import Certificate, or the official original or certified copy of the equivalent document, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant has received a facsimile of the Import Certificate or equivalent official document at the time the license application is filed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant states on the application that a facsimile of the Import Certificate or equivalent official document has been received and that no shipment will be made against the license prior to obtaining the original or certified copy of the Import Certificate or the original or certified copy of the equivalent official document issued by the importing country and retaining it on file. Generally, BIS will not consider any license application for the export of firearms items if the application is not supported by an Import Certificate or its official equivalent. If the government of the importing country will not issue an Import Certificate or its official equivalent, the applicant must supply the information described in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(vi) through (viii) of this section on company letterhead.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Countries to which firearms controls apply. The firearms controls apply to all OAS member countries: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Items/Commodities. An Import Certificate or equivalent official document is required for items controlled under Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) 0A984, 0A986, or 0A987.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use of the Import Certificate. An Import Certificate or equivalent official document can only be used to support one BIS Form-748P, Multipurpose Application. The BIS Form-748P, Multipurpose Application, must include the same items as those listed on the Import Certificate or the equivalent official document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Validity period. Import Certificates or equivalent official documents issued by an OAS member country will be valid for a period of one year or less. Although licenses generally are valid for two years, your ability to ship may be affected by the validity of the Import Certificate or equivalent official document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> How to obtain an Import Certificate for firearms items destined to OAS member countries. (1) Applicants must request that the importer (e.g., ultimate consignee or purchaser) obtain the Import Certificate or an equivalent official document from the government of the importing country, and that it be issued covering the quantities and types of items that the applicant intends to export. Upon receipt of the Import Certificate or its official equivalent, the importer must provide the original or a certified copy of the Import Certificate or the original or a certified copy of the equivalent official document to the applicant. The applicant shall obtain the required documents prior to submitting a license application, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicants must request that the importer (e.g., ultimate consignee or purchaser) obtain the Import Certificate or an equivalent official document from the government of the importing country, and that it be issued covering the quantities and types of items that the applicant intends to export. Upon receipt of the Import Certificate or its official equivalent, the importer must provide the original or a certified copy of the Import Certificate or the original or a certified copy of the equivalent official document to the applicant. The applicant shall obtain the required documents prior to submitting a license application, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Import Certificate or its official equivalent must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Applicant's name and address. The applicant may be either the exporter, supplier, or order party.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Import Certificate Identifier/Number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Name of the country issuing the certificate or unique country code.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Date the Import Certificate was issued, in international date format (e.g., 24/12/98 (24 December 1998), or 3/1/99 (3 January 1999)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Name of the agency issuing the certificate, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, signing officer name, and signature.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Name of the importer, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, country of residence, representative's name if commercial or government body, citizenship, and signature.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Name of the end-user(s), if known and different from the importer, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, country of residence, representative's name if commercial (authorized distributor or reseller) or government body, citizenship, and signature. Note that BIS does not require the identification of each end-user when the firearms items will be resold by a distributor or reseller if unknown at the time of export.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Description of the items approved for import including a technical description and total quantity of firearms, parts and components, ammunition and parts.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (g)(2)(viii): You must furnish the consignee with a detailed technical description of each item to be given to the government for its use in issuing the Import Certificate. For example, for shotguns, provide the type, barrel length, overall length, number of shots, the manufacturer's name, the country of manufacture, and the serial number for each shotgun. For ammunition, provide the caliber, velocity and force, type of bullet, manufacturer's name and country of manufacture.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Expiration date of the Import Certificate in international date format (e.g., 24/12/98) or the date the items must be imported, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Name of the country of export (i.e., United States).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Additional information. Certain countries may require the tariff classification number, by class, under the Brussels Convention (Harmonized Tariff Code) or the specific technical description of an item. For example, shotguns may need to be described in barrel length, overall length, number of shots, manufacturer's name and country of manufacture. The technical description is not the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Where to obtain Import Certificates. See Supplement No. 6 to this part for a list of the OAS member countries' authorities administering the Import Certificate System.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Alterations. After an Import Certificate or official equivalent document is used to support the issuance of a license, no corrections, additions, or alterations may be made on the Certificate by any person. If you desire to explain any information contained on the Import Certificate or official equivalent document, you may attach a signed statement to the Import Certificate or official equivalent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Request for return of Import Certificates. A U.S. exporter may be requested by a foreign importer to return an unused Import Certificate. Refer to Sec. 748.9(j) of this part for procedures and recordkeeping requirements for returning an Import Certificate retained by the applicant.
