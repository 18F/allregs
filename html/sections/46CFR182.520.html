A second power pump is an acceptable alternative to a  hand pump if it is supplied by a source of power independent of the  first power bilge pump. Individual power pumps used for separate spaces  are to be controlled from a central control point and must have a light  or other visual means at the control point to indicate operation.</p><p class="depth2">Table 182.520(a) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Min. capacity required</p><p class="depth2">Number of passengers            Length of vessel          Bilge pumps required     per pump ltrs/min (gal/</p><p class="depth2">min) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Any number....................
