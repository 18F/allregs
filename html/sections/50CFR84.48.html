                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of real property must  follow the rules established in 43 CFR 12.71 and 50 CFR 80.14.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant must  be vested in the State or subgrantee, including local governments and  nonprofit organizations. States must submit documentation (e.g.,  appraisals and appraisal reviews) to the Regional Director who must  approve it before the State becomes legally obligated for the purchase.  States will provide title vesting evidence and summary of land costs  upon completion of the acquisition. The grant agreement and any deed to  third parties (e.g., conservation easement or other lien on a third- party property) must include appropriate language to ensure that the  lands and/or interests would revert back to the State or Federal  Government if the conditions of the grant were no longer being  implemented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases where the interest obtained is less than fee simple  title, the interest must be sufficient for long-term conservation of the  specified wetlands resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Real property acquired with National Coastal Wetlands  Conservation Grant funds must continue to serve the purpose for which it  was acquired. If acquired property is used for reasons inconsistent with  the purpose(s) for which acquired, such activities must cease and any  adverse effects on the property must be corrected by the State or  subgrantee with non-Federal   monies in accordance with 50 CFR 80.14.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The State or subgrantee may not dispose of or encumber its title  or other interest in real property without prior approval of the  appropriate Regional Director of the Service. Real property includes,  but is not limited to, lands, buildings, minerals, energy resources,  timber, grazing, and animal products. If real property is sold, the  State or subgrantee must compensate the Service in accordance with 43  CFR 12.71(c)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If rights or interests obtained with the acquisition of coastal  wetlands generate revenue during the Grant Agreement period, the State  will treat the revenue as program income and use it to manage the  acquired properties. If the State sells or leases real property, the  State must treat the proceeds as program income and return the money to  the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration program regardless of the grant  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Inconsistent use that is not corrected can be grounds for  denying a State future grants under this Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A coastal State is responsible for design, supervision, and  inspection of all major construction projects in accordance with  accepted engineering standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The coastal State must have adequate rights to lands or waters  where restoration or enhancement projects are planned to ensure  protection and use of the facilities or structures throughout their  useful life.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The construction, enlargement, or rehabilitation of dams are  subject to Federal standards for dam design. If requested, the State  must provide to the Regional Office written certification that any  proposed changes to a dam meet Federal standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The coastal State must operate and maintain facilities,  structures, or related assets to ensure their use for the stated project  purpose and that they are adequately protected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acquisition, property records, maintenance, and disposal of  equipment must be made in accordance with 43 CFR 12.72.
