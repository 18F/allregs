                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. This section covers enclosed spaces that may be entered  by employees. It does not apply to vented vaults if the employer makes a  determination that the ventilation system is operating to protect  employees before they enter the space. This section applies to routine  entry into enclosed spaces. If, after the employer takes the precautions  given in this section and in Sec. 1926.965, the hazards remaining in  the enclosed space endanger the life of an entrant or could interfere  with an entrant's escape from the space, then entry into the enclosed  space must meet the permit space entry requirements of subpart AA of  this part. For routine entries where the hazards remaining in the  enclosed space do not endanger the life of an entrant or interfere with  an entrant's escape from the space, this section applies in lieu of the  permit-space entry requirements contained in Sec. Sec. 1926.1204  through 926.1211.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Hazardous atmosphere. Employees may not enter any enclosed space  while it contains a hazardous atmosphere, unless the entry conforms to  the confined spaces in construction standard in subpart AA of this part.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec. 1926.953.: Entries into enclosed spaces conducted in  accordance with the permit space entry requirements of subpart AA of  this part are considered as complying with this section.</p>
