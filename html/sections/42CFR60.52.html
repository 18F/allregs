                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a school receives from a HEAL lender a loan disbursement check or draft payable jointly to the school and to one of its students, it must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the school receives the instrument after the student is enrolled, obtain the student's endorsement, retain that portion of funds due the school, and disburse the remaining funds to the student.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the school receives the instrument before the student is enrolled, it must, prior to endorsing the instrument, send the instrument to the student to endorse and return to the school. The school may then retain that portion of funds then due the school but must hold the remaining funds for disbursement to the student at the time of enrollment. However, if the student is unable to meet other educational expenses due before the time of enrollment, the school may obtain the student's endorsement and disburse to the student that portion of funds required to meet these other educational expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a school determines that a student does not plan to enroll, the school must return a loan disbursement check or draft to the lender within 30 days of this determination.
