                                Sec. 210.10-01  Interim financial statements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Condensed statements. Interim financial statements shall follow  the general form and content of presentation prescribed by the other  sections of this Regulation with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interim financial statements required by this rule need only be  provided as to the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated and may  be unaudited. Separate statements of other entities which may otherwise  be required by this regulation may be omitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interim balance sheets shall include only major captions (i.e.,  numbered captions) prescribed by the applicable sections of this  Regulation with the exception of inventories. Data as to raw materials,  work in process and finished goods inventories shall be included either  on the face of the balance sheet or in the notes to the financial  statements, if applicable. Where any major balance sheet caption is less  than 10% of total assets, and the amount in the caption has not  increased or decreased by more than 25% since the end of the preceding  fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interim statements of income shall also include major captions  prescribed by the applicable sections of this Regulation. When any major  income statement caption is less than 15% of average net income for the  most recent three fiscal years and the amount in the caption has not  increased or decreased by more than 20% as compared to the corresponding  interim period of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined  with others. In calculating average net income, loss years should be  excluded. If losses were incurred in each of the most recent three  years, the average loss shall be used for purposes of this test.  Notwithstanding these tests, Sec. 210.4-02 applies and de minimis  amounts therefore need not be shown separately, except that registrants  reporting under Sec. 210.9 shall show investment securities gains or  losses separately regardless of size.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The statement of cash flows may be abbreviated starting with a  single figure of net cash flows from operating activities and showing  cash changes from investing and financing activities individually only  when they exceed 10% of the average of net cash flows from operating  activities for the most recent three years. Notwithstanding this test,  Sec. 210.4-02 applies and de minimis amounts therefore need not be  shown separately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The interim financial information shall include disclosures  either on the face of the financial statements or in accompanying  footnotes sufficient so as to make the interim information presented not  misleading. Registrants may presume that users of the interim financial  information have read or have access to the audited financial   statements for the preceding fiscal year and that the adequacy of  additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation, except in regard  to material contingencies, may be determined in that context.  Accordingly, footnote disclosure which would substantially duplicate the  disclosure contained in the most recent annual report to security  holders or latest audited financial statements, such as a statement of  significant accounting policies and practices, details of accounts which  have not changed significantly in amount or composition since the end of  the most recently completed fiscal year, and detailed disclosures  prescribed by Rule 4-08 of this Regulation, may be omitted. However,  disclosure shall be provided where events subsequent to the end of the  most recent fiscal year have occurred which have a material impact on  the registrant. Disclosures should encompass for example, significant  changes since the end of the most recently completed fiscal year in such  items as: accounting principles and practices; estimates inherent in the  preparation of financial statements; status of long-term contracts;  capitalization including significant new borrowings or modification of  existing financing arrangements; and the reporting entity resulting from  business combinations or dispositions. Notwithstanding the above, where  material contingencies exist, disclosure of such matters shall be  provided even though a significant change since year end may not have  occurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Detailed schedules otherwise required by this Regulation may be  omitted for purposes of preparing interim financial statements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In addition to the financial statements required by paragraphs  (a) (2), (3) and (4) of this section, registrants in the development  stage shall provide the cumulative financial statements (condensed to  the same degree as allowed in this paragraph) and disclosures required  by FASB ASC Topic 915, Development Stage Entities, to the date of the  latest balance sheet presented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other instructions as to content. The following additional  instructions shall be applicable for purposes of preparing interim  financial statements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Summarized income statement information shall be given  separately as to each subsidiary not consolidated or 50 percent or less  owned persons or as to each group of such subsidiaries or fifty percent  or less owned persons for which separate individual or group statements  would otherwise be required for annual periods. Such summarized  information, however, need not be furnished for any such unconsolidated  subsidiary or person which would not be required pursuant to Rule 13a-13  or 15d-13 to file quarterly financial information with the Commission if  it were a registrant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If appropriate, the income statement shall show earnings per  share and dividends declared per share applicable to common stock. The  basis of the earnings per share computation shall be stated together  with the number of shares used in the computation. In addition, see Item  601(b)(11) of Regulation S-K, (17 CFR 229.601(b)(11)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, during the most recent interim period presented, the  registrant or any of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a  combination between entities under common control, the interim financial  statements for both the current year and the preceding year shall  reflect the combined results of the combined businesses. Supplemental  disclosure of the separate results of the combined entities for periods  prior to the combination shall be given, with appropriate explanations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where a material business combination has occurred during the  current fiscal year, pro forma disclosure shall be made of the results  of operations for the current year up to the date of the most recent  interim balance sheet provided (and for the corresponding period in the  preceding year) as though the companies had combined at the beginning of  the period being reported on. This pro forma information shall, at a  minimum, show revenue, income before extraordinary items and the  cumulative effect of accounting changes, including such income on a per  share basis, net income, net income attributable to the registrant, and  net income per share.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where the registrant has reported a discontinued operation (as  required   by FASB ASC Subtopic 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements-- Discontinued Operations) during any of the periods covered by the  interim financial statements, the effect thereof on revenues and net  income--total and per share--for all periods shall be disclosed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In addition to meeting the reporting requirements specified by  existing standards for accounting changes, the registrant shall state  the date of any material accounting change and the reasons for making  it. In addition, for filings on Form 10-Q, a letter from the  registrant's independent accountant shall be filed as an exhibit (in  accordance with the provisions of Item 601 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR  229.601) in the first Form 10-Q after the date of an accounting change  indicating whether or not the change is to an alternative principle  which, in the accountant's judgment, is preferable under the  circumstances; except that no letter from the accountant need be filed  when the change is made in response to a standard adopted by the  Financial Accounting Standards Board that requires such change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any material retroactive prior period adjustment made during any  period convered by the interim financial statements shall be disclosed,  together with the effect thereof upon net income--total and per share-- of any prior period included and upon the balance of retained earnings.  If results of operations for any period presented have been adjusted  retroactively by such an item subsequent to the initial reporting of  such period, similar disclosure of the effect of the change shall be  made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any unaudited interim financial statements furnished shall  reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management,  necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods  presented. A statement to that effect shall be included. Such  adjustments shall include, for example, appropriate estimated provisions  for bonus and profit sharing arrangements normally determined or settled  at year-end. If all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, a  statement to that effect shall be made; otherwise, there shall be  furnished information describing in appropriate detail the nature and  amount of any adjustments other than normal recurring adjustments  entering into the determination of the results shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An interim balance sheet as of the end of the most recent fiscal  quarter and a balance sheet as of the end of the preceding fiscal year  shall be provided. The balance sheet as of the end of the preceding  fiscal year may be condensed to the same degree as the interim balance  sheet provided. An interim balance sheet as of the end of the  corresponding fiscal quarter of the preceding fiscal year need not be  provided unless necessary for an understanding of the impact of seasonal  fluctuations on the registrant's financial condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interim statements of income shall be provided for the most  recent fiscal quarter, for the period between the end of the preceding  fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the  corresponding periods of the preceding fiscal year. Such statements may  also be presented for the cumulative twelve month period ended during  the most recent fiscal quarter and for the corresponding preceding  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interim statements of cash flows shall be provided for the  period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the  most recent fiscal quarter, and for the corresponding period of the  preceding fiscal year. Such statements may also be presented for the  cumulative twelve month period ended during the most recent fiscal  quarter and for the corresponding preceding period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Registrants engaged in seasonal production and sale of a single- crop agricultural commodity may provide interim statements of income and  cash flows for the twelve month period ended during the most recent  fiscal quarter and for the corresponding preceding period in lieu of the  year-to-   date statements specified in (2) and (3) above.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interim review by independent public accountant. Prior to  filing, interim financial statements included in quarterly reports on  Form 10-Q (17 CFR 249.308(a)) must be reviewed by an independent public  accountant using professional standards and procedures for conducting  such reviews, as established by generally accepted auditing standards,  as may be modified or supplemented by the Commission. If, in any filing,  the company states that interim financial statements have been reviewed  by an independent public accountant, a report of the accountant on the  review must be filed with the interim financial statements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Filing of other interim financial information in certain cases.  The Commission may, upon the informal written request of the registrant,  and where consistent with the protection of investors, permit the  omission of any of the interim financial information herein required or  the filing in substitution thereof of appropriate information of  comparable character. The Commission may also by informal written notice  require the filing of other information in addition to, or in  substitution for, the interim information herein required in any case  where such information is necessary or appropriate for an adequate  presentation of the financial condition of any person for which interim  financial information is required, or whose financial information is  otherwise necessary for the protection of investors.
