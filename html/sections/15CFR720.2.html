The notification letter shall reference the person's  conviction, specify the number of years for which BIS intends to deny  export privileges, set forth the statutory and regulatory authority for  the action, state whether the denial order will be standard or non- standard pursuant to Supplement No. 1 to part 764 of the Export  Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 774), and provide  that the person may request a hearing before the Administrative Law  Judge within 30 days from the date of the notification letter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waiver. The failure of the notified person to file a request for  a hearing within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the person's  right to contest the denial of export privileges that BIS intends to  impose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Order of Assistant Secretary. If no hearing is requested, the  Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement will order that export  privileges be denied as indicated in the notification letter.
