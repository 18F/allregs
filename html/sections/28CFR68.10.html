The filing of a motion to dismiss does not affect the time period for filing an answer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrative Law Judge may dismiss the complaint, based on a motion by the respondent or without a motion from the respondent, if the Administrative Law Judge determines that the complainant has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. However, in the prehearing phase of an adjudicatory proceeding brought under this part, the Administrative Law Judge shall not dismiss a complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, upon his or her own motion, without affording the complainant an opportunity to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed.
