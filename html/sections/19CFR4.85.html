                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any foreign vessel or documented vessel with a registry  endorsement, arriving from a foreign port with cargo or passengers  manifested for ports in the United States other than the port of first  arrival, may proceed with such cargo or passengers from port to port,  provided a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set  forth in Sec. 113.64 of this chapter relating to international carriers  in a suitable amount is on file with the director of the port of first  entry. \115\ No additional bond shall be required at subsequent ports of  entry. Before the vessel departs from the port of first arrival, the  master shall obtain from the port director a certified copy of the  complete inward foreign manifest (hereinafter referred to as the  traveling manifest). The certified copy shall have a legend similar to  the following endorsed on the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement,  Customs Form 1300: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\115\ ``* * * Any vessel arriving from a foreign port or place  having on board merchandise shown by the manifest to be destined to a  port or ports in the United States other than the port of entry at which  such vessel first arrived and made entry may proceed with such  merchandise from port to lading thereof.'' (Tariff Act of 1930, sec.  442; 19 U.S.C. 1442)</p><p class="depth2">116-118 [Reserved]  ________________________________________________________________________ Port Date</p><p class="depth2">Certified to be a true copy of the original inward foreign manifest.  ________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth2">Signature and title</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before a vessel proceeds from one domestic port to another  with cargo or passengers on board as described in paragraph (a) of this  section, the master must present to the director of such port of  departure an application in triplicate on Customs Form   1300 for a permit to proceed to the next port. When a port director  grants the permit on Customs Form 1300, the following legend must be  endorsed on the form:</p><p class="depth3">Port</p><p class="depth3">Date</p><p class="depth3">Permission is granted to proceed to the port named in item 12.</p><p class="depth3">--------</p><p class="depth3">Signature and title</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The duplicate must be attached to the traveling manifest and the  triplicate (the permit to proceed to be delivered at the next port) must  be returned to the master, together with the traveling manifest and the  vessel's document, if on deposit. If no inward foreign cargo or  passengers are to be discharged at the next port, that fact must be  indicated on Customs Form 1300 by inserting ``To load only'' in  parentheses after the name of the port to which the vessel is to  proceed. The traveling Crew's Effects Declaration covering articles  acquired abroad by officers and members of the crew, together with the  unused crewmembers' declarations prepared for such articles, will be  placed in a sealed envelope addressed to the appropriate Customs officer  at the next port and given to the master for delivery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon the arrival of a vessel at the next and each succeeding  domestic port with inward foreign cargo or passengers still on board,  the master must immediately report its arrival and make entry within 48  hours. To make such entry, he must deliver to the port director the  vessel's document, the permit to proceed (Customs Form 1300 endorsed in  accordance with paragraph (b) of this section), the traveling manifest,  and the traveling Crew's Effects Declaration (Customs Form 1304),  together with the crewmembers' declarations received on departure from  the previous port. The master must also present an abstract manifest  consisting of a newly executed Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement,  Customs Form 1300, a Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, and a  Passenger List, Customs and Immigration Form I-418, in such number of  copies as may be required for local Customs purposes, of any cargo or  passengers on board manifested for discharge at that port, a Crew's  Effects Declaration in duplicate of all unentered articles acquired  abroad by officers and crewmembers which are still on board, a Ship's  Stores Declaration, Customs Form 1303, in duplicate of the sea or ship's  stores remaining on board, and if applicable, the Cargo Declaration  required by Sec. 4.86. If no inward foreign cargo or passengers are to  be discharged, the Cargo Declaration or Passenger List may be omitted  from the abstract manifest, and the following legend must be placed in  item 15 of the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement:</p><p class="depth3">Vessel on an inward foreign voyage with residue cargo/passengers for  --------. No cargo or passengers for discharge at this port.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The traveling manifest, together with a copy of the newly  executed Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, will serve the purpose  of a copy of an abstract manifest at the port where it is finally  surrendered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If boarding is required before the port director will issue a  permit or special license to lade or unlade, the abstract manifest  described in paragraph (c) of this section shall be ready for  presentation to the boarding officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The traveling manifest shall be surrendered to the director of  the final domestic port of discharge of the cargo, except that if  residue foreign cargo remains on board for discharge at a foreign port  or ports, the traveling manifest shall be surrendered at the final port  of departure from the United States. However, it shall not be  surrendered at the port from which the vessel departs for another United  States port, via an intermediate foreign port, under Sec. 4.89 if  residue foreign cargo remains on board for discharge at a subsequent  U.S. port. The traveling Crew's Effects Declaration shall be finally  surrendered to the director of any port from which the vessel will  depart directly for a foreign port.
