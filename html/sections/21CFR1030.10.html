The provisions of this standard are applicable to microwave ovens manufactured after October 6, 1971.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--(1) Microwave oven means a device designed to heat, cook, or dry food through the application of electromagnetic energy at frequencies assigned by the Federal Communications Commission in the normal ISM heating bands ranging from 890 megahertz to 6,000 megahertz. As defined in this standard, ``microwave ovens'' are limited to those manufactured for use in homes, restaurants, food vending, or service establishments, on interstate carriers, and in similar facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Microwave oven means a device designed to heat, cook, or dry food through the application of electromagnetic energy at frequencies assigned by the Federal Communications Commission in the normal ISM heating bands ranging from 890 megahertz to 6,000 megahertz.

The equivalent plane-wave power density existing in the proximity of the external oven surface shall not exceed 1 milliwatt per square centimeter at any point 5 centimeters or more from the

external surface of the oven, measured prior to acquisition by a purchaser, and, thereafter, 5 milliwatts per square centimeter at any such point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Power density limit.
