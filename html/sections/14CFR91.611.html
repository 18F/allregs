                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The holder of an air carrier operating certificate or  an operating certificate issued under part 125 may conduct a ferry  flight of a four-engine airplane or a turbine-engine-powered airplane  equipped with three engines, with one engine inoperative, to a base for  the purpose of repairing that engine subject to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The airplane model has been test flown and found satisfactory  for safe flight in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section,  as appropriate. However, each operator who before November 19, 1966, has  shown that a model of airplane with an engine inoperative is  satisfactory for safe flight by a test flight conducted in accordance  with performance data contained in the applicable Airplane Flight Manual  under paragraph (a)(2) of this section need not repeat the test flight  for that model.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The approved Airplane Flight Manual contains the following  performance data and the flight is conducted in accordance with that  data:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Maximum weight.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Center of gravity limits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Configuration of the inoperative propeller (if applicable).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Runway length for takeoff (including temperature  accountability).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Altitude range.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Certificate limitations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Ranges of operational limits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Performance information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Operating procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The operator has FAA approved procedures for the safe operation  of the airplane, including specific requirements for--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Limiting the operating weight on any ferry flight to the minimum  necessary for the flight plus the necessary reserve fuel load;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A limitation that takeoffs must be made from dry runways  unless, based on a showing of actual operating takeoff techniques on wet  runways with one engine inoperative, takeoffs with full controllability  from wet runways have been approved for the specific model aircraft and  included in the Airplane Flight Manual:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operations from airports where the runways may require a  takeoff or approach over populated areas; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Inspection procedures for determining the operating condition  of the operative engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No person may take off an airplane under this section if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The initial climb is over thickly populated areas; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Weather conditions at the takeoff or destination airport are  less than those required for VFR flight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Persons other than required flight crewmembers shall not be  carried during the flight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> No person may use a flight crewmember for flight under this  section unless that crewmember is thoroughly familiar with the operating  procedures for one-engine inoperative ferry flight contained in the  certificate holder's manual and the limitations and performance  information in the Airplane Flight Manual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Flight tests: reciprocating-engine-powered airplanes. The  airplane performance of a reciprocating-engine-powered airplane with one  engine inoperative must be determined by flight test as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A speed not less than 1.3 VS1 must be chosen at which  the airplane may be controlled satisfactorily in a climb with the  critical engine inoperative (with its propeller removed or in a  configuration desired by the operator and with all other engines  operating at the maximum power determined in paragraph (b)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The distance required to accelerate to the speed listed in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section and to climb to 50 feet must be  determined with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The landing gear extended;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The critical engine inoperative and its propeller removed or in  a configuration desired by the operator; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The other engines operating at not more than maximum power  established under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The takeoff, flight and landing procedures, such as the  approximate trim settings, method of power application, maximum power,  and speed must be established.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The performance must be determined at a maximum weight not  greater than the weight that allows a rate of climb of at least 400 feet  per minute in the en route configuration set forth in Sec. 25.67(d) of  this chapter in effect on January 31, 1977, at an altitude of 5,000  feet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The performance must be determined using temperature  accountability for the takeoff field length, computed in accordance with  Sec. 25.61 of this chapter in effect on January 31, 1977.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Flight tests: Turbine-engine-powered airplanes. The airplane  performance of a turbine-engine-powered airplane with one engine  inoperative must be determined by flight tests, including at least three  takeoff tests, in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Takeoff speeds VR and V2, not less than  the corresponding speeds under which the airplane was type certificated  under Sec. 25.107 of this chapter, must be chosen at which the airplane  may be controlled satisfactorily with the critical engine inoperative  (with its propeller removed or in a configuration desired by the  operator, if applicable) and with all other engines operating at not  more than the power selected for type certification as set forth in  Sec. 25.101 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The minimum takeoff field length must be the horizontal distance  required to accelerate and climb to the 35-foot height at V2  speed (including any additional speed increment obtained in the tests)  multiplied by 115 percent and determined with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The landing gear extended;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The critical engine inoperative and its propeller removed or in  a configuration desired by the operator (if applicable); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The other engine operating at not more than the power selected  for type certification as set forth in Sec. 25.101 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The takeoff, flight, and landing procedures such as the  approximate trim setting, method of power application, maximum power,  and speed must be established. The airplane must be satisfactorily  controllable during the entire takeoff run when operated according to  these procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The performance must be determined at a maximum weight not  greater than the weight determined under Sec. 25.121(c) of this chapter  but with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The actual steady gradient of the final takeoff climb  requirement not less than 1.2 percent at the end of the takeoff path  with two critical engines inoperative; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The climb speed not less than the two-engine inoperative trim  speed for the actual steady gradient of the final takeoff climb  prescribed by paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The airplane must be satisfactorily controllable in a climb with  two critical engines inoperative. Climb performance may be shown by  calculations based on, and equal in accuracy to, the results of testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The performance must be determined using temperature  accountability for takeoff distance and final takeoff climb computed in  accordance with Sec. 25.101 of this chapter.  For the purpose of paragraphs (c)(4) and (5) of this section, two  critical engines means two adjacent engines on one side of an airplane  with four engines, and the center engine and one outboard engine on an  airplane with three engines.</p>
