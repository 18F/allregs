Factors to be considered shall include, but not be limited to,  the true purpose of the entry, the possible burdens or threats to the  defense facilities which the presence of the ship, aircraft, or the  individual or individuals involved impose or might reasonably be  expected to impose on those islands in the Kwajalein Atoll under U.S.  Army jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Request for entry authorizations will be evaluated and adjudged  as to whether the entry at the time and for the purpose stated will or  will not be inimical to the purposes of U.S. national defense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Aliens and permanent resident aliens. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Entry of aliens for  employment or residence (except as specified in paragraph 3-2.b.) in an  area entirely within the borders of Kwajalein Missile Range is not  authorized except when such entry would serve the interests of the U.S.  Government, and then only for specified periods and under prescribed   conditions. Entry application shall include the name and nationality of  the person desiring entry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alien and immigrant spouses and dependents of U.S. citizen  sponsors or principals assigned to Kwajalein Missile Range may be  granted entry authorization by the National Range Commander so long as  U.S. sponsor or principal remains on duty or resides within Kwajalein  Missile Range.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Excluded persons. Excluded persons, as defined in 1-3.e., are  normally prohibited from entering Kwajalein Missile Range.

Unauthorized marine  vessels and aircraft will be seized for prosecution along with the crew,  passengers, and cargo.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Military areas. Entries authorized under this instruction do not  restrict the authority of the Commander, Kwajalein Missile Range, to  impose and enforce proper regulations restricting movement into or  within portions of Kwajalein Missile Range reserved for military  operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Waivers. No one except the National Range Commander, or his duly  authorized representative, has authority to waive the requirements of  this regulation.
