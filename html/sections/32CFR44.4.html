                            <p class="depth0">It is DoD policy that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Members of the Ready Reserve shall be screened (see the appendix to this part for specific screening guidance) at least annually to meet the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 10149 and to provide a Ready Reserve force composed of members who:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meet Military Service wartime standards of mental, moral, professional, and physical fitness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Possess the military qualifications required in the various ranks, ratings, and specialties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Are available immediately for active duty (AD) during a mobilization or as otherwise required by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On mobilization under 10 U.S.C. 12301(a) or 10 U.S.C. 12302, all personnel actions relating to the screening program shall be held in abeyance, and all members remaining in the Ready Reserve shall be considered immediately available for AD service. After such a mobilization is ordered, no deferment, delay, or exemption from mobilization shall be granted to Ready Reservists because of their civilian employment. On involuntary activation of Reserve members under 10 U.S.C. 12304 (Presidential Reserve Call-Up Authority), the Secretary of Defense, or designee, shall make a determination regarding the continuation or cessation of personnel actions related to the screening program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All Ready Reservists shall be retained in the Ready Reserve for the entire period of their statutory obligation or voluntary contract. Exceptions to that policy are made in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section, or may be made by the Secretaries concerned, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 10145 and 10146.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A member of the Army National Guard of the United States or the Air

National Guard of the United States may be transferred to the Standby Reserve only with the consent of the governor or other applicable authority of the State, commonwealth, or territory concerned (including the District of Columbia) in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 10146.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any eligible member of the Standby Reserve may be transferred back to the Ready Reserve when the reason for the member's transfer to the Standby Reserve no longer exists in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 10150 and DoD Instruction 1200.15.\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ Copies may be obtained at http://web7.whs.osd.mil/corres.htm.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Ready Reservists whose immediate recall to AD during an emergency would create an extreme personal or community hardship shall be transferred to the Standby Reserve or the Retired Reserve, or shall be discharged, as applicable, except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Ready Reservists who are designated key employees or who occupy key positions, as defined in this section, shall be transferred to the Standby Reserve or the Retired Reserve, or shall be discharged, as appropriate, except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Ready Reservists who are also DoD civilian employees may not hold a mobilization assignment to the same positions that they fill as civilian employees. Those Ready Reservists shall be reassigned or transferred, as applicable. Reserve component military technicians (dual status), as members of Reserve units, are excluded from this provision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Ready Reservists who are preparing for the ministry in an accredited theology or divinity school cannot be involuntarily called to AD or required to participate in inactive duty training (IDT) in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 12317. Accordingly, such Ready Reservists (other than those participating in a military Chaplain Candidate or Theology Student Program) shall be transferred to the Standby Reserve (active status list) for the duration of their ministerial studies and duties at accredited theology or divinity schools. Ready Reservists participating in a military Chaplain Candidate or Theology Student Program may continue their Ready Reserve affiliation and engage in AD and IDT.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Ready Reservists may not be transferred from the Ready Reserve solely because they are students, interns, residents, or fellows in the healthcare professions. On mobilization, they either shall be deferred or shall be mobilized in a student, intern, resident, or fellow status until qualified in the applicable medical specialty, as prescribed by the Secretaries of the Military Departments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The Secretaries concerned, or their designees, shall make determinations for mobilization availability on a case-by-case basis, consistent with this part, and not by class or group determinations.</p>
