When we determine whether you took protective action within a reasonable time, we will consider several factors including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Time required to evaluate the characteristics and performance of the draining well;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rig availability;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Well depth;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Required environmental analysis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special lease stipulations which provide limited time frames in which to drill; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Weather conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If BLM determines that you did not take protection action timely, you will owe compensatory royalty for the period of the delay under Sec. 3162.2-12.
