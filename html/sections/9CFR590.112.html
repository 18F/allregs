                            <p class="depth0">Pending final action by the Secretary, any person authorized to  countersign a license to perform inspection services may, whenever he  deems such action necessary to assure that any inspection service is  properly performed, suspend any license to perform inspection services  issued pursuant to this part by giving notice of such suspension to the  respective licensee, accompanied by a statement of the reasons   therefor. Within 7 days after the receipt of the aforesaid notice and  statement of reasons by the licensee, he may file an appeal in writing,  with the Secretary, supported by any argument or evidence that he may  wish to offer as to why his license should not be suspended or revoked.  After the expiration of the aforesaid 7-day period and consideration of  such argument and evidence, the Secretary will take such action as he  deems appropriate with respect to such suspension or revocation. When no  appeal is filed within the prescribed 7 days, the license is revoked or  suspended.</p>
