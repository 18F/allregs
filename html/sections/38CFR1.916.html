                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Department of Veterans Affairs may disclose all information  determined to be necessary, including the name, address, Department of  Veterans Affairs file number, Social Security number, and date of birth,  to consumer reporting agencies for the purpose of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtaining the location of an individual indebted to the United  States as a result of participation in any benefits program administered  by VA or indebted in any other manner to VA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Obtaining a consumer report in order to assess an individuals  ability to repay a debt when such individual has failed to respond to  the Department's demand for repayment or when such individual has  notified the Department that he/she will not repay the indebtedness; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Obtaining the location of an individual in order to conduct  program evaluation studies as required by 38 U.S.C. 527 or any other  law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information disclosed by the Department of Veterans Affairs  under paragraph (a) of this section to consumer reporting agencies shall  neither expressly nor implicitly indicate that an individual is indebted  to the United States nor shall such information be recorded by consumer  reporting agencies in a manner that reflects adversely upon the  individual. Prior to disclosing this information, the Department of  Veterans Affairs shall ascertain that consumer reporting agencies with  which it contracts are able to comply with this requirement. The  Department of Veterans Affairs shall also make reasonable efforts to  insure compliance by its contractor with this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (d) of this  section, information concerning individuals may be disclosed to consumer  reporting agencies for inclusion in consumer reports pertaining to the  individual, or for the purpose of locating the individual. Disclosure of  the fact of indebtedness will be made if the individual fails to respond  in accordance with written demands for repayment, or refuses to repay a  debt to the United States. In   making any disclosure under this section, VA will provide consumer  reporting agencies with sufficient information to identify the  individual, including the individual's name, address, if known, date of  birth, VA file number, and Social Security number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to releasing information under paragraph (c) of this  section, the Department of Veterans Affairs will send a notice to the  individual. This notice will inform the individual that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Department of Veterans Affairs has determined that he or she  is indebted to the Department of Veterans Affairs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The debt is presently delinquent; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The fact of delinquency may be reported to consumer reporting  agencies after 30 days have elapsed from the date of the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In accordance with Sec.  1.911 and Sec.  1.911a, VA shall  notify each individual of the right to dispute the existence and amount  of the debt and to request a waiver of the debt, if applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the Department of Veterans Affairs has not previously  notified the individual of the rights described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)  of this section, the Department of Veterans Affairs will include this  information in the notice described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.  The individual shall be afforded a minimum of 30 days from the date of  the notice to respond to it before information is reported to consumer  reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Department of Veterans Affairs will defer reporting  information to a consumer reporting agency if the individual disputes  the existence or amount of any debt or requests waiver of the debt  within the time limits set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this  section. The Department of Veterans Affairs will review any dispute and  notify the individual of its findings. If the original decision is  determined to be correct, or if the individual's request for waiver is  denied, the Department of Veterans Affairs may report the fact of  delinquency to a consumer reporting agency. However, the individual  shall be afforded 30 days from date of the notice of the agency's  determination to repay the debt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Nothing in this section affects an individual's right to appeal  an agency decision to the Board of Veterans Appeals. However,  information concerning the debt may be disclosed while an appeal is  pending before the Board of Veterans Appeals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Upon request, the Department of Veterans Affairs will notify an  individual--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether information concerning a debt has been reported to  consumer reporting agencies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Of the name and address of each consumer reporting agency to  which information has been released; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Of the specific information released.  A notice of the right to request this information will be sent with the  notice described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Subsequent to disclosure of information to consumer reporting  agencies as described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Department  of Veterans Affairs shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notify on a monthly basis each consumer reporting agency  concerned of any substantial change in the status or amount of  indebtedness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Promptly verify any and all information disclosed if so  requested by the consumer reporting agency concerned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In the absence of a different rule prescribed by statute,  contract, or other regulation, an indebtedness is considered delinquent  if not paid by the individual by the date due specified in the notice of  indebtedness, unless satisfactory arrangements are made by such date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notification shall be considered sufficient when effected by  ordinary mail, addressed to the last known address, and such notice is  not returned as undeliverable by postal authorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) does not apply to any contract  between the Department of Veterans Affairs and a consumer reporting  agency, nor does it apply to a consumer reporting agency and its  employees. See 38 U.S.C. 5701(i). This paragraph does not relieve the  Department of Veterans Affairs of its obligation to comply with the  Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i))</em>  [46 FR 62058, Dec. 22, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 42107, Nov. 3, 1987.
