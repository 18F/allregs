                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General intent. All actions taken by the Accused that are necessary for completion of a crime must be performed with general intent. This intent is not listed as a separate element. When the mens rea required for culpability to attach involves an intent that a particular consequence occur, or some other specific intent, an intent element is included. The necessary relationship between such intent element and the conduct constituting the actus reus is not articulated for each set of elements, but is presumed; a nexus between the two is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The element of wrongfulness and defenses. Conduct must be wrongful to constitute one of the offenses enumerated herein or any other offense triable by military commission. Conduct is wrongful if it is done without justification or excuse cognizable under applicable law. The element of wrongfulness (or the absence of lawful justification or excuse), which may be required under the customary law of armed conflict, is not repeated in the elements of crimes in Sec. 11.6. Conduct satisfying the elements found herein shall be inferred to be wrongful in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Similarly, this part does not enunciate defenses that may apply for specific offenses, though an Accused is entitled to raise any defense available under the law of armed conflict. Defenses potentially available to an Accused under the law of armed conflict, such as self-defense, mistake of fact, and duress, may be applicable to certain offenses subject to trial by military commission. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, defenses in individual cases shall be presumed not to apply. The burden of going forward with evidence of lawful justification or excuse or any applicable defense shall be upon the Accused. With respect to the issue of combatant immunity raised by the specific enumeration of an element requiring the absence thereof, the prosecution must affirmatively prove that element regardless of whether the issue is raised by the defense. Once an applicable defense or an issue of lawful justification or lawful excuse is fairly raised by the evidence presented, except for the defense of lack of mental responsibility, the burden is on the prosecution to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct was wrongful or that the defense does not apply. With respect to the defense of lack of mental responsibility, the Accused has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, the Accused was unable to appreciate the nature and quality of the wrongfulness of the Accused's acts. As provided in 32 CFR 9.5(c), the prosecution bears the burden of establishing the Accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in all cases tried by a military commission. Each element of an offense enumerated herein must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statute of limitations. Violations of the laws of war listed herein are not subject to any statute of limitations.</p>
