                            <p class="depth0">Under the 1872 Mining Law (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.), a person has a  statutory right consistent with other laws and Departmental regulations,  to go upon the open (unappropriated and unreserved) public lands for the  purpose of mineral prospecting, exploration, development, and  extraction. The Federal Land Policy and management Act requires the  Secretary to regulate mining operations in lands under wilderness review  to prevent impairment of the suitability of these areas for inclusion in  the wilderness system. However, mining operations occurring in the same  manner and degree that were being conducted on October 21, 1976, may  continue, even if they are determined to be impairing. Mining activities  not exceeding manner and degree shall be regulated only to prevent undue  and unnecessary degradation of public lands.</p>
