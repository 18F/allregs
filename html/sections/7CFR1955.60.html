                                Sec. 1955.60  Inventory property subject to redemption by the borrower.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If inventory property is subject to redemption rights, the State Director, with prior approval of OGC, will issue a State Supplement giving guidance concerning the former borrower's rights, whether or not the property may be leased or sold by the Government, payment of taxes, maintenance, and any other items OGC deems necessary to comply with State laws. Routine care and maintenance will be provided according to Sec. 1955.64 of this subpart to preserve and protect the property. Repairs are limited to those essential to prevent further deterioration of the property or to remove a health or safety hazard to the community in accordance with Sec. 1955.64(a) of this subpart unless State law permits full recovery of cost of repairs in which case usual policy on repairs is applicable. If the former borrower with redemption rights has possession of the property or has a right to lease proceeds, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will not rent the property until the redemption period has expired unless the State Director obtains prior authorization from OGC. Further guidance on sale subject to redemption rights is set forth in Sec. 1955.138 of Subpart C of this part.
