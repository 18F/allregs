The officers  identified in Sec. 757.5(b) may collect the full amount on all claims,  and may compromise, execute releases or terminate collection action on  all claims of $20,000.00 or less. Collection action may be terminated  for the convenience of the Government if the tortfeasor cannot be  located, is found to be judgment-proof, has denied liability, or has  refused to respond to repeated correspondence concerning legal liability  involving a small claim. A termination for the convenience of the  Government is made after it is determined that the case does not warrant  litigation or that it is not cost-effective to pursue recovery efforts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims over $100,000.00. Claims in excess of $100,000.00 may not  be compromised for less than the full amount or collection action  terminated without approval from the Department of Justice (DOJ).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification. The Judge Advocate General shall be notified prior  to all requests made to the DOJ to compromise, terminate collection, or  referral for further collection action or litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Litigation reports.
