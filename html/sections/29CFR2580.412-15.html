                                Sec. 2580.412-15  Procedures to be used for estimating the amount of  cases where there is no preceding reporting year.

                            <p class="depth0">If for any reason a plan does not have a complete preceding  reporting year, the amount ``handled'' by persons required to be covered  by a bond shall be estimated at the beginning of the calendar, policy or  other fiscal year, as the case may be, which would constitute either the  operating year or the reporting year of the plan, whichever shall occur  first, as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the case of a plan having a previous experience year, even  though it has no preceding reporting year, the estimate of the amount to  be ``handled'' for any person required to be covered shall be based on  the experience in the previous year by applying the same standards and  criteria as in a plan which has a preceding reporting year. Similarly,  where a plan is recently established, but has had, at the time a bond is  obtained, sufficient experience to reasonably estimate a complete year's  experience for persons required to be bonded, the amount of funds to be  ``handled'' shall be projected to the complete year on the basis of the  period in which the plan has had experience, unless, to the knowledge of  the plan administrator, the given period of experience is so seasonal or  unrepresentative of the complete year's experience as not to provide a  reasonable basis for projecting the estimate for the complete year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where a plan does not have any prior experience sufficient to  allow it to estimate the amount ``handled'' in the manner outlined in  paragraph (a) of this section, the amount to be ``handled'' by the  administrators, officers and employees of the plan during the current  reporting year shall be that amount initially required to fund or set up  the plan, plus the amount of contributions required to be made under the  plan formula from any source during the current reporting year. In most  cases, the amount of contributions will be calculated by multiplying the  total yearly contribution per participant (required by the plan formula  from either employers, employees, employer organizations or any other  source) by the number of participants in the plan at the beginning of  such reporting year. In cases where the per capita contribution cannot  readily be determined, such as in the case of certain insured plans  covered by the Act, the amount of contributions shall be estimated on  the amount of insurance premiums which are actuarially estimated as  necessary to support the plan, or on such other actuarially estimated  basis as may be applicable. In the case of a newly formed profit-sharing  plan covered by the Act, if the employer establishing the plan has a  previous year of experience, the amount of contributions required by the  plan formula shall be estimated on the basis of the profits of the  previous year. The amount of the bond shall then be fixed at 10 percent  of this calculation, but   not more than $500,000. A bond for such amount shall be obtained in any  form the plan desires on all persons who are administrators, officers,  or employees of the plan and who ``handle'' funds or other property of  the plan.</p>
