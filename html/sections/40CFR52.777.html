                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met because the plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of the national standards for photochemical oxidants (hydrocarbons) in the Metropolitan Indianapolis Intrastate Region by May 31, 1975.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The requirements of subpart G are not met by Revised APC-15 (November 8, 1974 submission) because it does not provide for attainment and maintenance of the photochemical oxidant

(hydrocarbon) standards throughout Indiana.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Part D--Conditional approval--The 1979 Indiana plan for Clark, Floyd, Elkhart, Lake, Marion, Porter, and St. Joseph Counties is approved provided the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan for stationary source volatile organic compound control must contain the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)-(iv)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For regulation 325 IAC 8-5, Section 6, Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning, the State must conduct a study to demonstrate that the 1,500 gallons exemption meets RACT requirements and submit the results to EPA within 6 months of the effective date of final rulemaking on 325 IAC 8 for VOC from Group II CTG source categories. If the demonstrated emissions resulting from the State's exemption are not essentially equivalent to those resulting from the RACT requirements, then the State must submit to EPA by July 1, 1983, a rule which requires control of emissions from dry cleaning sources using less than 1,500 gallons of perchloroethylene per year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The stationary source volatile organic control measures submitted by the State on October 23, 1990, and August 19, 1991, are approved as described in 40 CFR 52.770(c)(87) with the exception of 326 IAC 8-5-4 Pneumatic Rubber Tire Manufacturing, on which USEPA has taken no action. It should be noted that although the State's control measures provide that equivalent test methods, alternative emission controls, and revisions in rule applicability must be submitted to the USEPA as proposed revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP), such proposed SIP revisions are not part of the SIP unless and until they are approved as such by the USEPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Part D--Disapproval. The 1982 Indiana plan for Lake and Porter County is disapproved because it does not assure the attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS there. See Sec. Sec. 52.770(c)(69) and 52.773(i). The disapproval does not affect USEPA's approval (or conditional approval) of individual parts of Indiana's ozone plan and they remain approved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Approval--The Administrator approves the incorporation of the photochemical assessment ambient monitoring system submitted by Indiana on November 15, 1993, into the Indiana State Implementation Plan. This submittal satisfies 40 CFR 58.20(f), which requires the State to provide for the establishment and maintenance of photochemical assessment monitoring stations (PAMS) by November 12, 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Approval. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management submitted two ozone redesignation requests and maintenance plans requesting the ozone nonattainment areas to be redesignated to attainment for ozone: South Bend/Elkhart (St. Joseph and Elkhart Counties), submitted on September 22, 1993; Indianapolis (Marion County), submitted on November 12, 1993. The redesignation requests and maintenance plans meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(d) of the Act as amended in 1990. The redesignations meet the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Indiana Ozone State Implementation Plan for the above mentioned counties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The base year ozone precursor emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for the following areas: Vanderburgh County in the Evansville Metropolitan Area; Marion County in the Indianapolis Metropolitan Area; and St. Joseph and Elkhart Counties in the South Bend Metropolitan Area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> On November 17, 1993, Indiana submitted two of three elements required by section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990 to be incorporated as part of the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) State Implementation Plan intended to offset any growth in emissions from a growth in vehicle miles traveled. These elements are the offsetting of growth in emissions attributable to growth in VMT which was due November 15, 1992, and, any transportation control measures (TCMs) required as part of Indiana's 15 percent reasonable further progress (RFP) plan which was due November 15, 1993. Indiana satisfied the first requirement by projecting emissions from mobile sources and demonstrating that no increase in emissions would take place.

Indiana satisfied the second requirement by determining that no TCMs were required as part of Indiana's 15 percent RFP plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Approval--EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen (NOX) reasonably available control technology (RACT), new source review (NSR), vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general conformity exemptions for the Indiana portion of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County severe ozone nonattainment area as requested by the States of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 13, 1994 submittal. This approval does not cover the exemption of NOX transportation conformity requirements of section 176(c) for this area. Approval of these exemptions is contingent on the results of the final ozone attainment demonstration expected to be submitted in mid-1997. The approval will be modified if the final attainment demonstration demonstrates that NOX emission controls are needed in the nonattainment area to attain the ozone standard in the Lake Michigan Ozone Study modeling domain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> The base year ozone precursor emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for Lake and Porter Counties, Indiana.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> On June 26, 1995, and June 13, 1997, Indiana submitted a 15 percent rate-of-progress plan for the Lake and Porter Counties portion of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County ozone nonattainment area.

The July 12, 1995, corrections are recognized revisions to Indiana's emissions inventory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> On July 12, 1995, Indiana submitted as a revision to the Indiana State Implementation Plan a ridesharing transportation control measure which affects commuters in Clark and Floyd Counties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> On August 26, 1996, Indiana submitted a rule for the purpose of meeting oxides of nitrogen (NOX) reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements under section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (Act) for the Clark and Floyd Counties moderate ozone nonattainment area. The rule's NOX control requirements meets RACT for major sources of portland cement kilns, electric utility boilers, and industrial, commercial, or institutional boilers. In addition, on April 30, 1997, Indiana certified to the satisfaction of the United States Environmental Protection Agency that, to the best of the State's knowledge, there are no remaining major sources of NOX in Clark and Floyd Counties which need RACT rules. Indiana, therefore, has satisfied the NOX RACT requirements under section 182(f) of the Act for the Clark and Floyd Counties ozone nonattainment area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Approval--On February 5, 1997, Indiana submitted a transportation control measure under section 108(f)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990 for Vanderburgh County, Indiana to aid in reducing emissions of precursors of ozone. The transportation control measure being approved as a revision to the ozone state implementation plan is the conversion of at least 40 vehicles from gasoline as a fuel to compressed natural gas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> Indiana's November 15, 1996, request for a 1-year attainment date extension for the Indiana portion of the Louisville moderate ozone nonattainment area which consists of Clark and Floyd Counties is approved. The date for attaining the ozone standard in these counties is November 15, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(s)</em> Approval--On November 4, 1993, the State of Indiana submitted a maintenance plan and a request that Vanderburgh County be redesignated to attainment of the 1-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990. The redesignation

meets the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Indiana ozone State Implementation Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(t)</em> Approval--On May 24, 1996, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan for Lake and Porter Counties. The submittal pertained to a plan for the implementation of the Federal transportation conformity requirements in accordance with 40 CFR part 51 subpart T--Conformity to State or Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects Developed, Funded or Approved Under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(u)</em> On December 17, 1997, and January 22, 1998, Indiana submitted the Post-1996 rate-of-progress plan for the Lake and Porter Counties portion of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County ozone nonattainment area. This plan satisfies the counties' requirements under section 182(c)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. The plan contains a 1999 mobile source vehicle emission budget for volatile organic compounds of 40,897 pounds per average summer day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Negative declarations--Aerospace coating operations, industrial clean up solvents, industrial wastewater processes, offset lithography operations, business plastics, automotive plastics, and synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industries (SOCMI) batch processes, reactors and distillation units categories. On November 8, 1999, the State of Indiana certified to the satisfaction of the Environmental Protection Agency that no major sources categorized as part of the nine categories listed above and have a potential to emit 100 tons or more of volatile organic compounds annually are located in Clark or Floyd Counties in southeast Indiana, adjacent to Louisville, Kentucky.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(w)</em> Negative declarations--Aerospace coating operations, industrial clean up solvents, industrial wastewater processes, offset lithography operations, business plastics, automotive plastics, and synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industries (SOCMI) batch processes, reactors and distillation units categories. On November 8, 1999, and January 10, 2000, the State of Indiana certified to the satisfaction of the Environmental Protection Agency that no major sources categorized as part of the nine categories listed above and have a potential to emit 25 tons or more of volatile organic compounds annually are located in Lake or Porter Counties in northwest Indiana.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> The request submitted by Indiana on April 11, 2001 and supplemented on August 24, 2001, to redesignate the Indiana portion of the Louisville moderate interstate ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment was approved on October 23, 2001. The motor vehicle emissions budgets for VOC and NOX in the Indiana portion of the Louisville moderate interstate maintenance plan are adequate for conformity purposes and approvable as part of the maintenance plan.
