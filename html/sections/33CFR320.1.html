                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Regulatory approach of the Corps of Engineers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers has been involved in regulating certain activities in  the nation's waters since 1890. Until 1968, the primary thrust of the  Corps' regulatory program was the protection of navigation. As a result  of several new laws and judicial decisions, the program has evolved to  one involving the consideration of the full public interest by balancing  the favorable impacts against the detrimental impacts. This is known as  the ``public interest review.'' The program is one which reflects the  national concerns for both the protection and utilization of important  resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Corps is a highly decentralized organization. Most of the  authority for administering the regulatory program has been delegated to  the thirty-six district engineers and eleven division engineers. A  district engineer's   decision on an approved jurisdictional determination, a permit denial,  or a declined individual permit is subject to an administrative appeal  by the affected party in accordance with the procedures and authorities  contained in 33 CFR part 331. Such administrative appeal must meet the  criteria in 33 CFR 331.5; otherwise, no administrative appeal of that  decision is allowed. The terms ``approved jurisdictional  determination,'' ``permit denial,'' and ``declined permit'' are defined  at 33 CFR 331.2. There shall be no administrative appeal of any issued  individual permit that an applicant has accepted, unless the authorized  work has not started in waters of the United States, and that issued  permit is subsequently modified by the district engineer pursuant to 33  CFR 325.7 (see 33 CFR 331.5(b)(1)). An affected party must exhaust any  administrative appeal available pursuant to 33 CFR part 331 and receive  a final Corps decision on the appealed action prior to filing a lawsuit  in the Federal courts (see 33 CFR 331.12).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Corps seeks to avoid unnecessary regulatory controls. The  general permit program described in 33 CFR parts 325 and 330 is the  primary method of eliminating unnecessary federal control over  activities which do not justify individual control or which are  adequately regulated by another agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Corps is neither a proponent nor opponent of any permit  proposal. However, the Corps believes that applicants are due a timely  decision. Reducing unnecessary paperwork and delays is a continuing  Corps goal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Corps believes that state and federal regulatory programs  should complement rather than duplicate one another. The Corps uses  general permits, joint processing procedures, interagency review,  coordination, and authority transfers (where authorized by law) to  reduce duplication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Corps has authorized its district engineers to issue formal  determinations concerning the applicability of the Clean Water Act or  the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 to activities or tracts of land and  the applicability of general permits or statutory exemptions to proposed  activities. A determination pursuant to this authorization shall  constitute a Corps final agency action. Nothing contained in this  section is intended to affect any authority EPA has under the Clean  Water Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Types of activities regulated. This part and the parts that  follow (33 CFR parts 321 through 330) prescribe the statutory  authorities, and general and special policies and procedures applicable  to the review of applications for Department of the Army (DA) permits  for controlling certain activities in waters of the United States or the  oceans. This part identifies the various federal statutes which require  that DA permits be issued before these activities can be lawfully  undertaken; and related Federal laws and the general policies applicable  to the review of those activities. Parts 321 through 324 and 330 address  special policies and procedures applicable to the following specific  classes of activities:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dams or dikes in navigable waters of the United States (part  321);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other structures or work including excavation, dredging, and/or  disposal activities, in navigable waters of the United States (part  322);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Activities that alter or modify the course, condition, location,  or capacity of a navigable water of the United States (part 322);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Construction of artificial islands, installations, and other  devices on the outer continental shelf (part 322);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United  States (part 323);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Activities involving the transportation of dredged material for  the purpose of disposal in ocean waters (part 324); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Nationwide general permits for certain categories of activities  (part 330).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Forms of authorization. DA permits for the above described  activities are issued under various forms of authorization. These  include individual permits that are issued following a review of  individual applications and general permits that authorize a category or  categories of activities in specific geographical regions or nationwide.  The term ``general permit'' as used in these regulations (33 CFR parts  320 through   330) refers to both those regional permits issued by district or  division engineers on a regional basis and to nationwide permits which  are issued by the Chief of Engineers through publication in the Federal  Register and are applicable throughout the nation. The nationwide  permits are found in 33 CFR part 330. If an activity is covered by a  general permit, an application for a DA permit does not have to be made.  In such cases, a person must only comply with the conditions contained  in the general permit to satisfy requirements of law for a DA permit. In  certain cases pre-notification may be required before initiating  construction. (See 33 CFR 330.7)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> General instructions. General policies for evaluating permit  applications are found in this part. Special policies that relate to  particular activities are found in parts 321 through 324. The procedures  for processing individual permits and general permits are contained in  33 CFR part 325. The terms ``navigable waters of the United States'' and  ``waters of the United States'' are used frequently throughout these  regulations, and it is important from the outset that the reader  understand the difference between the two. ``Navigable waters of the  United States'' are defined in 33 CFR part 329. These are waters that  are navigable in the traditional sense where permits are required for  certain work or structures pursuant to Sections 9 and 10 of the Rivers  and Harbors Act of 1899. ``Waters of the United States'' are defined in  33 CFR part 328. These waters include more than navigable waters of the  United States and are the waters where permits are required for the  discharge of dredged or fill material pursuant to section 404 of the  Clean Water Act.
