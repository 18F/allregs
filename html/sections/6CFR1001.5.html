If the FOIA Officer cannot  locate responsive records based on your written description, you will be  notified and advised that further identifying information is necessary  before the request can be fulfilled. Although requests are considered  either FOIA or Privacy Act requests, the Board processes requests for  records in accordance with both laws so as to provide the greatest  degree of lawful access while safeguarding an individual's personal  privacy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Your request should specify your preferred form or format  (including electronic formats) for the records you seek. We will  accommodate your request if the record is readily available in that form  or format. When you do not specify the form or format of the response,  we will provide responsive records in the form or format most convenient  to us.</p>
