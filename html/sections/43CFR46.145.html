                            <p class="depth0">Bureaus should use adaptive management, as appropriate, particularly  in circumstances where long-term impacts may be uncertain and future  monitoring will be needed to make adjustments in subsequent  implementation decisions. The NEPA analysis conducted in the context of  an adaptive management approach should identify the range of management  options that may be taken in response to the results of monitoring and  should analyze the effects of such options. The environmental effects of  any adaptive management strategy must be evaluated in this or subsequent  NEPA analysis.</p>
