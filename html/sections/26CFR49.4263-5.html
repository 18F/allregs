                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Amounts paid for the transportation of persons on a small aircraft of the type sometimes referred to as ``air taxis'' shall be exempt from the tax imposed under section 4261 provided the aircraft (1) has a gross take-off weight of less than 12,500 pounds determined as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and (2) has a passenger seating capacity of less than 10 adult passengers, including the pilot. The exemption does not apply, however, if the aircraft is operated on an established line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of gross take-off weight. The term ``gross take-off weight of less than 12,500 pounds'' means a maximum certificated take-off weight of less than 12,500 pounds. This shall be based on the maximum certificated take-off weight shown in the aircraft operating record or aircraft flight manual which is part of the air worthiness certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Established line. The term ``operated on an established line'' means operated with some degree of regularity between definite points. It does not necessarily mean that strict regularity of schedule is maintained; that the full run is always made; that a particular route is followed; or that intermediate stops are restricted. The term implies that the person rendering the service maintains and exercises control over the direction, route, time, number of passengers carried, etc.
