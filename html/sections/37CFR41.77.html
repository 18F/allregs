                                Sec.  41.77  Decisions and other actions by the Board.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Patent Trial and Appeal Board, in its decision, may affirm  or reverse each decision of the examiner on all issues raised on each  appealed claim, or remand the reexamination proceeding to the examiner  for further consideration. The reversal of the examiner's determination  not to make a rejection proposed by the third party requester  constitutes a decision adverse to the patentability of the claims which  are subject to that proposed rejection which will be set forth in the  decision of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board as a new ground of  rejection under paragraph (b) of this section. The affirmance of the  rejection of a claim on any of the grounds specified constitutes a  general affirmance of the decision of the examiner on that claim, except  as to any ground specifically reversed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Should the Board reverse the examiner's determination not to  make a rejection proposed by a requester, the Board shall set forth in  the opinion in support of its decision a new ground of rejection; or  should the Board have knowledge of any grounds not raised in the appeal  for rejecting any pending claim, it may include in its opinion a  statement to that effect with its reasons for so holding, which  statement shall constitute a new ground of rejection of the claim. Any  decision which includes a new ground of rejection pursuant to this  paragraph shall not be considered final for judicial review. When the  Board makes a new ground of rejection, the owner, within one month from  the date of the decision, must exercise one of the following two options  with respect to the new ground of rejection to avoid termination of the  appeal proceeding as to the rejected claim:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reopen prosecution. The owner may file a response requesting  reopening of prosecution before the examiner. Such a response must be  either an amendment of the claims so rejected or new evidence relating  to the claims so rejected, or both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Request rehearing. The owner may request that the proceeding be  reheard under Sec.  41.79 by the Board upon the same record. The request  for rehearing must address any new ground of rejection and state with  particularity the points believed to have been misapprehended or  overlooked in entering the new ground of rejection and also state all  other grounds upon which rehearing is sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the owner has filed a response requesting reopening of  prosecution under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any requester,  within one month of the date of service of the owner's response, may  once file comments on the response. Such written comments must be  limited to the issues raised by the Board's opinion reflecting its  decision and the owner's response. Any requester that had not previously  filed an appeal or cross appeal and is seeking under this subsection to  file comments or a reply to the comments is subject to the appeal and  brief fees under Sec.  41.20(b)(1) and (2), respectively, which must  accompany the comments or reply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Following any response by the owner under paragraph (b)(1) of  this section and any written comments from a requester under paragraph  (c) of this section, the proceeding will be remanded to the examiner.  The statement of the Board shall be binding upon the examiner unless an  amendment or new evidence not previously of record is made which, in the  opinion of the examiner, overcomes the new ground of rejection stated in  the decision. The examiner will consider any owner response under  paragraph (b)(1) of this section and any written comments by a requester  under paragraph (c) of this section and issue a determination that the  rejection is maintained or has been overcome.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Within one month of the examiner's determination pursuant to  paragraph (d) of this section, the owner or any requester may once  submit comments in response to the examiner's determination. Within one  month of the date of service of comments in response to the examiner's  determination, the owner and any requesters may file a reply to the  comments. No requester reply may address the comments of any other  requester reply. Any requester that had not previously filed an appeal  or cross appeal and is seeking under this subsection to file comments or  a reply to the comments is subject to the appeal and brief fees under  Sec.  41.20(b)(1) and (2), respectively, which must accompany the  comments or reply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> After submission of any comments and any reply pursuant to  paragraph (e) of this section, or after time has expired, the proceeding  will be returned to the Board which shall reconsider the matter and  issue a new decision. The new decision is deemed to incorporate the  earlier decision, except for those portions specifically withdrawn.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The time period set forth in paragraph (b) of this section is  subject to the extension of time provisions of Sec.  1.956 of this title  when the owner is responding under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The  time period set forth in paragraph (b) of this section may not be  extended when the owner is responding under paragraph (b)(2) of this  section. The time periods set forth in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this  section may not be extended.  [69 FR 50003, Aug. 12, 2004, as amended at 77 FR 46631, Aug. 6, 2012]</p>
