                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Name. The name of the viticultural area described in this section is ``Ben Lomond Mountain.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved maps. The appropriate maps for determining the boundaries of the Ben Lomond Mountain viticultural area are four 7.5 minute series U.S.G.S. maps. They are titled:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Davenport Quadrangle (1955, photorevised 1968);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Big Basin Quadrangle (1955, photorevised 1973);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Felton Quadrangle (1955, photorevised 1980); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Santa Cruz Quadrangle (1954, photorevised 1981).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boundaries. The Ben Lomond Mountain viticultural area is located entirely within Santa Cruz County, California, which is in the central part of the State near the coast. The beginning point is the intersection of sections 25, 26, 35 and 36 (Davenport Quadrangle, T. 10S., R. 3W.) which coincides with the 800-foot contour line and is approximately .6 mile northwest of the top of Bald Mountain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From the beginning point, the boundary follows the 800-foot contour line in a meandering manner in a generally northwesterly direction across section 26 into section 27 (T. 10S., R. 3W.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Thence along the 800-foot contour line in an easterly and then generally a northeasterly direction through section 27 and then back across the northwest corner of section 26 and thence in a generally northwesterly direction

along the 800-foot contour line across sections 23, 22 and into section 15.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Thence along the 800-foot contour line in a northerly and then a southerly direction across section 22 and eventually in a generally northwesterly direction into section 20.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Thence continuing along the 800-foot contour line in a generally northwesterly direction through sections 20, 17, 16, 17, 16, 9, 8, 5, 8, 7 and 6 (T. 10S., R. 3W.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Thence continuing in a northerly direction across sections 5 and 32 and thence in a southwesterly direction across sections 31 and 6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Thence continuing in a generally northerly direction across sections 1, 6, 31, 36, 31, 36 and 30 (T. 9S., R. 3W.) to the intersection of the 800-foot contour line and Scott Creek in section 19 (T. 9S., R. 3W.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Thence in a northeasterly direction along the south bank of Scott Creek through sections 19, 20 and 17 to the intersection of Scott Creek with the 1600-foot contour line in section 16 (T. 9S., R. 3W.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Thence in a generally northeasterly and then southerly direction along the 1600-foot contour line through section 16 and then through the southeast and southwest corners of sections 9 and 10 respectively to the intersection of the 1600-foot contour line with Jamison Creek in section 16 (T. 9S., R. 3W.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Thence in an easterly direction along the south bank of Jamison Creek across sections 15 and 14 (T. 9S., R. 3W.) to the intersection of Jamison Creek and the 800-foot contour line in the southeast corner of section 14 (T. 9S., R. 3W.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Thence in a southeasterly direction in a meandering manner along the 800-foot contour line across sections 14, 23, 24, 25 (T. 9S., R. 3W.), sections 30 and 31 (T. 9S., R. 2W.), and sections 32, 5, 8, 9, 16, 17 and 21 (T. 10S., R. 2W.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Thence in a southwesterly, then generally a southeasterly and then a northwesterly direction along the 800-foot contour line in a meandering manner to section 31 and then continuing on through sections 31 and 30 (T. 10S., R. 2W.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Thence continuing along the 800-foot contour line in a generally southerly and then a generally northwesterly direction through sections 25, 36, 31 and 36 to the point of beginning at the intersection of sections 25, 26, 35 and 36 (T. 10S., R. 3W.).
