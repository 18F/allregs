                            <p class="depth0">For regularly scheduled meetings of the Board, members are expected  to attend in person. Unless prohibited by law or by these bylaws,  however, a member of the Board, under exceptional circumstances, may  participate in a meeting of the Board by conference telephone or similar  communications equipment which enables all persons participating in the  meeting to hear each other and which permits full compliance with the  provisions of these bylaws concerning public observation of meetings.  Attendance at a meeting by this method constitutes presence at the  meeting and a member of the Board may be paid for his or her  participation provided such meeting addresses substantive, as opposed to  procedural or administrative, matters on which the Board has  decisionmaking authority.</p>
