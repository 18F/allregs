                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Part 883, in effect as of February 29, 1980, applies to projects  for which the initial application was submitted on or after the February  29, 1980, effective date. (See 24 CFR part 883, revised as of April 1,  1980.) Projects for which applications or proposals were submitted  before the February 29, 1980, effective date of part 883 have been  processed under the part 883 regulations and procedures in effect at the  date of submission. If, however, the agency notified HUD within 60  calendar days of the February 29, 1980, effective date of the part 883  regulations that they chose to have the provisions of part 883, in  effect as of February 29, 1980, apply to a specific case, it must have  promptly modified the application(s) and proposal(s) to comply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subpart F of this part, dealing with the HAP contract and  subpart G of this part, dealing with management, apply to all projects  for which an Agreement was not executed before the February 29, 1980,  effective date of part 883. In cases where an Agreement has been  executed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Agency, owner and HUD may agree to make the revised subpart  F of this part applicable and execute appropriate amendments to the  Agreement or Contract;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Agency, Owner and HUD may agree to make the revised subpart  G of this part applicable (with or without the limitation on  distributions) and execute appropriate amendments to the Agreement or  Contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Section 883.708, Termination of Tenancy and Modifications of  Leases, applies to new families who begin occupancy or execute a lease  on or after 30 days following the February 29, 1980, effective date of  part 883.
