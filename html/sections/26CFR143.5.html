                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 4941(d)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code  of 1954 as added by section 101(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83  Stat. 500) provides that the term ``self-dealing'' includes any direct  or indirect payment of compensation (or payment or reimbursement of  expenses) by a private foundation to a disqualified person. Section  4941(d)(1)(E) provides that the term ``self-dealing'' includes any  direct or indirect transfer to, or use by, or for the benefit of, a  disqualified person of the income or assets of a private foundation.  Section 4941(d)(1)(F) provides that the term ``self-dealing'' includes  any direct or indirect agreement by a private foundation to make any  payment of money or other property to a government official other than  an agreement to employ such individual for any period after the  termination of his government service if such individual is terminating  his government service within a 90-day period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Indirect transactions by a private foundation. A transaction  engaged in directly with a Government official by an organization  described in section 509(a) (1), (2), or (3) which is the recipient of a  grant from a private foundation shall not constitute an indirect act of  self-dealing between such private foundation and Government official if  the private foundation does not earmark the use of the grant for any  named Government official and does not control or retain any veto power  over the selection of the Government official by the grantee  organization. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a grant by a  private foundation shall not constitute an indirect act of self-dealing  even though such foundation had reason to believe that certain  Government officials would derive benefits from such grant so long as  the grantee, in fact, exercises control over the selecting process and  actually makes the selection completely independent of the private  foundation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Example. The provisions of subsection (b) of this section may be  illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth2">Example. A private foundation made a grant to an organization  described in section 509(a) (1), (2), or (3) to conduct a judicial  seminar. The grantee conducting the seminar made payments to certain  Government officials. By the nature of the seminar the grantor  foundation had reason to believe that Government officials would be  compensated for participation in such seminar. The grantee, however, had  complete independent control over the selection of such participants.  Since the grantee has not acted as a conduit for the private foundation  and has, in fact, exercised independent control over the use of the  grant, such grant by the private foundation shall not constitute an act  of self-dealing with respect to the Government officials.
