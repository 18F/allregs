                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> does not include a  bank as defined in section 581 of the Internal Revenue Code. A  restriction imposed or required to be imposed by Federal or State law is  not an applicable restriction. An option, right to use property, or  agreement that is subject to section 2703 is not an applicable  restriction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of disregarding an applicable restriction. If an  applicable restriction is disregarded under this section, the  transferred interest is valued as if the restriction does not exist and  as if the rights of the transferor are determined under the State law  that would apply but for the restriction. For example, an applicable  restriction with respect to preferred stock will be disregarded in  determining the amount of a transfer of common stock under section 2701.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. D owns a 76 percent interest and each of D's children, A  and B, owns a 12 percent interest in General Partnership X. The  partnership agreement requires the consent of all the partners to  liquidate the partnership. Under the State law that would apply in the  absence of the restriction in the partnership agreement, the consent of  partners owning 70 percent of the total partnership interests would be  required to liquidate X. On D's death, D's partnership interest passes  to D's child, C. The requirement that all the partners consent to  liquidation is an applicable restriction. Because A, B and C (all  members of D's family), acting together after the transfer, can remove  the restriction on liquidation, D's interest is valued without regard to  the restriction; i.e., as though D's interest is sufficient to liquidate  the partnership.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. D owns all the preferred stock in Corporation X. The  preferred stock carries a right to liquidate X that cannot be exercised  until 1999. D's children, A and B, own all the common stock of X. The  common stock is the only voting stock. In 1994, D transfers the  preferred stock to D's child, A. The restriction on D's right to  liquidate is an applicable restriction that is disregarded. Therefore,  the preferred stock is valued as though the right to liquidate were  presently exercisable.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. D owns 60 percent of the stock of Corporation X. The  corporate by-laws provide that the corporation cannot be liquidated for  10 years after which time liquidation requires approval by 60 percent of  the voting interests. In the absence of the provision in the by-laws,  State law would require approval by 80 percent of the voting interests  to liquidate X. D transfers the stock to a   trust for the benefit of D's child, A, during the 10-year period. The  10-year restriction is an applicable restriction and is disregarded.  Therefore, the value of the stock is determined as if the transferred  block could currently liquidate X.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. D and D's children, A and B, are partners in Limited  Partnership Y. Each has a 3.33 percent general partnership interest and  a 30 percent limited partnership interest. Any general partner has the  right to liquidate the partnership at any time. As part of a loan  agreement with a lender who is related to D, each of the partners agree  that the partnership may not be liquidated without the lender's consent  while any portion of the loan remains outstanding. During the term of  the loan agreement, D transfers one-half of both D's partnership  interests to each of A and B. Because the lender is a related party, the  requirement that the lender consent to liquidation is an applicable  restriction and the transfers of D's interests are valued as if such  consent were not required.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. D owns 60 percent of the preferred and 70 percent of the  common stock in Corporation X. The remaining stock is owned by  individuals unrelated to D. The preferred stock carries a put right that  cannot be exercised until 1999. In 1995, D transfers the common stock to  D's child in a transfer that is subject to section 2701. The restriction  on D's right to liquidate is an applicable restriction that is  disregarded in determining the amount of the gift under section 2701.
