                                Sec. 70.234  Protection for obligatory disbursement agreements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C.  6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 70.148 of this part, the lien is  not valid with respect to security interest which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Comes into existence after the tax lien filing,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is in qualified property covered by the terms of an obligatory  disbursement agreement entered into before the tax lien filing, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as  of the time of tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.  See Sec. 70.143 (a) and (e) of this part for definitions of the terms  ``security interest'' and ``tax lien filing.'' For purposes of this  section, a judgment lien creditor as defined in Sec. 70.143(g) of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Obligatory disbursement agreement. For purposes of this section,  the term ``obligatory disbursement agreement'' means a written  agreement, entered into by a person in the course of the person's trade  or business, to make disbursements. An agreement is treated as an  obligatory disbursement agreement only with respect to disbursements  which are required to be made by reason of the intervention of the  rights of a person other than the taxpayer. The obligation to pay must  be conditioned upon an event beyond the control of the obligor. For  example, the provisions of this section are applicable where an issuing  bank obligates itself to honor drafts or other demands for payment on a  letter of credit and a bank, in good faith, relies upon that letter of  credit in making advances. The provisions of this section are also  applicable, for example, where a bonding company obligates itself to  make payments to indemnify against loss or liability and, under the  terms of the bond, makes a payment with respect to a loss. The priority  described in this section is not applicable, for example, in the case of  an accommodation endorsement by an endorser who assumes the obligation  other than in the course of the endorser's trade or business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Qualified property. Except as provided under paragraph (d) of  this section, the term ``qualified property,'' for purposes of this  section, means property subject to the lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 at  the time of tax lien filing and, to the extent that the acquisition is  directly traceable to the obligatory disbursement, property acquired by  the taxpayer after tax lien filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rule for surety agreements. Where the obligatory  disbursement agreement is an agreement insuring the performance of a  contract of the taxpayer and another person, the term ``qualified  property'' shall be treated as also including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proceeds of the contract the performance of which was  insured, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the contract the performance of which was insured is a  contract to construct or improve real property, to produce goods, or to  furnish services, any tangible personal property used by the taxpayer in  the performance of the insured contract.  For example, a surety company which holds a security interest, arising  from cash disbursements made after tax lien filing under a payment or  performance bond on a real estate construction project, has priority  over the tax lien with respect to the proceeds of the construction  contract and, in addition, with respect to any tangible personal  property used by the taxpayer in the construction project if its  security interest in the tangible personal property is protected under  local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time the tax lien  was filed, out of an unsecured obligation.
