Manufacturers should prepare the instructions with this  purpose in mind. The instructions should be clear and, to the extent  practicable, written in nontechnical language.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The instructions must not be used to secure an unfair  competitive advantage. They should not restrict replacement equipment to  original equipment or service to dealer service. Manufacturers who so  restrict replacement equipment should be prepared to make public any  performance specifications on such equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purpose of encouraging proper maintenance, the  manufacturer shall provide a record or log book which shall contain a  schedule for the performance of all required noise emission control  maintenance. Space shall be provided in this record book so that the  purchaser can note what maintenance was done, by whom, where and when.
