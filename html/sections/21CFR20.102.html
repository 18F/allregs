The Food and Drug Administration will make available for public disclosure such records or documents if the agency can determine that it has an accurate copy of the actual record or document filed in the court. If the Food and Drug Administration cannot determine whether it has an accurate copy of such a record or document, the person requesting a copy shall be referred to the court involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After a recommendation for court action has been finally refused by a United States attorney, the correspondence with the United States attorney and the Department of Justice with respect to that recommendation, including the pleadings recommended for filing with the court, is available for public disclosure. Prior to disclosure of any record specifically reflecting consideration of possible criminal prosecution of any individual, all names and other information that would identify an individual who was considered for criminal prosecution but who was not prosecuted shall be deleted unless the Commissioner concludes that there is a compelling public interest in the disclosure of such names.</p>
