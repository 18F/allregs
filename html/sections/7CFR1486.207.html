                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This fund was established to address technical barriers to trade in emerging markets worldwide by providing technical assistance, training, and exchange of expertise. These include plant quarantine, animal health, food safety, and other technical barriers to U.S. exports based on unsound or incomplete scientific information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Funding priorities are principally those issues that are time sensitive and are strategic areas of longer term interest. Funding decisions are determined primarily through a review process that includes FAS and relevant regulatory agencies. The review is based upon the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The activity occurs in an eligible country or region of market priority;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The trade constraint warrants intervention;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proposed activity is likely to achieve an impact in the short-or long-term;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Recipient is qualified to undertake the proposed activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The budget requested is reasonable and includes leveraged resources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If applicable, a U.S. domestic constraint or trade issue can be resolved in support of a proposed activity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The activity has support from USDA field offices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Because of the time sensitive nature of the issues intended to be addressed by these funds, proposals, whether private or government, may be submitted at any time during the year. Reviews of proposals are scheduled on a monthly basis. An expedited review may be requested but must be justified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application content, evaluation, and reporting requirements are the same as for the Central Fund.</p>
