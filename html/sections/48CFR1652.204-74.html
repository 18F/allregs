                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed by 1604.7202, the contracting officer will insert the  following clause in all FEHB Program contracts based on cost analysis  (experience-rated):</p><p class="depth0">Large Provider Agreements (OCT 2005)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification and Information Requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The experience- rated Carrier must provide notice to the contracting officer of its  intent to enter into or to make a significant modification of a Large  Provider Agreement:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Not less than 60 days before entering into any Large Provider  Agreement; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not less than 60 days before exercising a renewal or other  option, or significant modification to a Large Provider Agreement, when  such action would result in total costs to the FEHB Program of an  additional 20 percent or more above the existing contract. However, if a  carrier is exercising a simple renewal or other option contemplated by a  Large Provider Agreement that OPM previously reviewed, and there are no  significant changes, then a statement to the effect that the renewal or  other option is being exercised along with the dollar amount is  sufficient notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The carrier's notification to the contracting officer must be in  writing and must, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Describe the supplies and/or services the proposed provider  agreement will require;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify the proposed basis for reimbursement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Identify the proposed provider agreement, explain why the  carrier selected the proposed provider, and what contracting method it  used, where applicable, including the kind of competition obtained;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Describe the methodology the carrier used to compute the  provider's profit; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Describe provider risk provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Contracting officer may request from the carrier any  additional information on a proposed provider agreement and its terms  and conditions prior to a provider award and during the performance of  the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 30 days of receiving the carrier's notification, the  Contracting officer will give the carrier either written comments or  written notice that there will be no comments. If the Contracting  officer comments, the carrier must respond in writing within 10 calendar  days, and explain how it intends to address any concerns.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When computing the carrier's service charge, the Contracting  officer will consider how well the carrier complies with the provisions  of this section, including the advance notification requirements, as an  aspect of the carrier's performance factor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Contracting officer's review of any Large Provider  Agreement, option, renewal, or modification will not constitute a  determination of the acceptability of the terms and conditions of any  provider agreement or   of the allowability of any costs under the carrier's contract, nor will  it relieve the carrier of any responsibility for performing the  contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records and Inspection. The carrier must insert in all Large  Provider Agreements the requirement that the provider will retain and  make available to the Government all records relating to the agreement  that support the annual statement of operations and enrollee records-- Retain for 6 years after the agreement term ends.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Audit and Records--Negotiation. The provisions of FAR 52.215-2,  ``Audit and Records--Negotiation,'' when required, or FEHBAR 1652.246- 70, ``FEHB Inspection'' apply to all experience-rated Carriers' Large  Provider Agreements. The Carrier will insert the clauses at FAR 52.215- 2, when applicable, or FEHBAR 1652.246-70 in all Large Provider  Agreements. In FAR 52.215-2 the carrier will substitute:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``Large Provider'' for the term ``Contractor''  throughout the clause, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term ``Large Provider Agreement'' for the term  ``Subcontracts'' in paragraph (g) of FAR 52.215-2. The term  ``Contracting officer'' will mean the FEHB Program Contracting officer  at OPM. The carrier will be responsible for ensuring the Large Provider  complies with the provisions set forth in the clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prohibited Agreements. No provider agreement made under this  contract will provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost  basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The carrier will insert this clause, 1652.204-74, in all Large  Provider Agreements.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [70 FR 31382, June 1, 2005, as amended at 71 FR 3016, Jan. 19, 2006]</p>
