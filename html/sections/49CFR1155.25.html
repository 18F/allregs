                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A land-use-exemption permit may be transferred from a rail carrier to an acquiring rail carrier without the need for a new application for a land-use-exemption permit if the rail line associated with the solid waste rail transfer facility is transferred to another rail carrier or to an entity formed to become a rail carrier pursuant to authority granted by the Board under 49 U.S.C. 10901, 10902, or 11323. When seeking Board authority under 49 U.S.C. 10901, 10902, or 11323, the applicant(s) shall specifically advise the Board, the municipality, the state, and any relevant political subdivision of a state or federal or state regional planning entity of the jurisdiction in which the solid waste rail transfer facility is located, of the intended transfer. The Federal Register notice concerning the acquisition shall include a statement that a solid waste rail transfer facility with a Board-issued land-use-exemption permit is included in the acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a carrier plans to cease using a facility as a solid waste rail transfer facility, or when a facility is transferred to any party in any manner other than that described in paragraph (a) of this section, the entity that received the land-use-exemption permit must notify the Board, the municipality, the state, and any relevant political subdivision of a state or federal or state regional planning entity of the jurisdiction in which the solid waste rail transfer facility is located, in writing no later than 60 days prior to the proposed cessation or transfer. Upon receipt of that notice, the Board will publish notice in the Federal Register that the land-use-exemption permit will be terminated on the 60th day unless otherwise ordered by the Board.</p>
