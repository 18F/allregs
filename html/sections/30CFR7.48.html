(1) Prepare one sample each of the insulated surfaces of the battery box and of the cover that measure at least 4 inches by 8 inches, by the thickness of the sample which includes the insulation plus the battery cover or box material. The insulation thickness shall be representative of that used on the battery box and cover. If the insulation material and thickness of material are identical for the battery box and cover, only one sample need be prepared and tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prepare one sample each of the insulated surfaces of the battery box and of the cover that measure at least 4 inches by 8 inches, by the thickness of the sample which includes the insulation plus the battery cover or box material.
