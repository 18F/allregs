                                Sec. 127.603  What are the requirements for filing an EDWOSB

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Format. Protests must be in writing and must specify all the grounds upon which the protest is based. A protest merely asserting that the protested concern is not an eligible EDWOSB or WOSB, without setting forth specific facts or allegations, is insufficient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing. Protestors may deliver their written protests in person, by facsimile, by express delivery service, e-mail, or by U.S. mail (received by the applicable date) to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To the contracting officer, if the protestor is an offeror for the specific contract; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the D/GC, if the protest is initiated by the contracting officer or SBA. IF SBA initiates a protest, the D/GC will notify the contracting officer of such protest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timeliness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For negotiated acquisitions, a protest from an interested party must be received by the contracting officer prior to the close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the apparent successful offeror or notification of award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For sealed bid acquisitions, a protest from an interested party must be received by close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any protest received after the time limit is untimely, unless it is from SBA or the contracting officer. A contracting officer or SBA may file an EDWOSB or WOSB protest at any time after bid opening or notification of intended awardee, whichever applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any protest received prior to bid opening or notification of intended awardee, whichever applies, is premature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A timely filed protest applies to the procurement in question even if filed after award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Referral to SBA. The contracting officer must forward to SBA any protest received, notwithstanding whether he or she believes it is premature, sufficiently specific, or timely. The contracting officer must send all protests, along with a referral letter and documents, directly to the Director for Government Contracting, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416, or by fax to (202) 205-6390, Attn: Women-Owned Small Business Status Protest. The contracting officer's referral letter must include information pertaining to the solicitation that may be necessary for SBA to determine timeliness and standing, including: the solicitation number; the name, address, telephone number and facsimile number of the contracting officer; whether the protestor submitted an offer; whether the protested concern was the apparent successful offeror; when the protested concern submitted its offer; whether the procurement was conducted using sealed bid or negotiated procedures; the bid opening date, if applicable; when the protest was submitted to the contracting officer; when the protestor received notification about the apparent successful offeror, if applicable; and whether a contract has been awarded. In addition, the contracting officer must send copies of any documents provided to the contracting officer pursuant to Sec. 127.300 (if the repository is unavailable). The D/GC or designee will decide the merits of EDWOSB or WOSB status protests.</p>
