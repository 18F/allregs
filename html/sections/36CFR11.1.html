                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term Arrowhead Symbol, as used in this part, refers to the insignia of the National Park Service prescribed as its official symbol by notice published in the Federal Register of March 15, 1962 (27 FR 2486). That symbol, use of which had been limited by notice published in the Federal Register of October 22, 1968 (33 FR 15605-06), has been reinstated as the Service's official emblem. The term ``Parkscape Symbol,'' as used in this part, is the same insignia referred to in the Federal Register notice of October 22, 1968, as the ``National Park Service Symbol.'' The ``Parkscape Symbol'' has been prescribed as the official tie tack or pin to be worn by all National Park Service uniformed employees. Moreover, the tie tack or pin may be worn by employees of the Service when not in uniform as a part of their civilian attire.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term commercial use as used in the regulations of this part refers to use of the ``Arrowhead Symbol'' or the ``Parkscape Symbol'' on souvenirs or

other items of merchandise presented for sale to the public by private enterprise operating either within or outside of areas of the National Park System.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term noncommercial use as used in the regulations of this part refers to nongovernmental use of the ``Arrowhead Symbol'' or the ``Parkscape Symbol'' other than as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
