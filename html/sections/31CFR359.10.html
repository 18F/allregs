                                Sec. 359.10  What is the fixed rate of return?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Secretary, or the Secretary's designee, determines the fixed  rate of return. The fixed rate is established for the life of the bond.  The fixed rate will always be greater than or equal to 0.00%. \1\ The  most recently announced fixed rate is only for bonds purchased during  the six months following the announcement, or for any other period of  time announced by the Secretary. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ However, the fixed rate is not a guaranteed minimum rate. The  composite rate is composed of both the fixed rate and a semiannual  inflation rate, which could possibly be less than the fixed rate or  negative in deflationary situations. In all cases, however, the  composite rate will always be greater than or equal to 0.00%.  [73 FR 65543, Nov. 4, 1008]</p>
