If  the State administrative plan and the annual submission are determined  to be approvable, the Regional Administrator will so notify the State in  writing. The State administrative plan is a one-time submission. Unless  amendments are necessary to meet Federal standards prescribed in the  regulations in this part or in CPG 1-3 or to reflect changes in the  State's administrative structure, procedures, criteria, or activities,  or unless a portion were conditionally approved by the Regional  Administrator as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, no  approval regarding the State administrative plan will be required for a  State which participated for the preceding Federal fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Agreement for contribution.

Refusal or failure to comply with such requirements and conditions  may result in the grantor agency cancelling, terminating, or suspending  the grant, in whole or in part, and refraining from extending any  further assistance to the grantee or subgrantee until satisfactory  assurance of future compliance has been received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disapproval or conditional approval.

The State shall  have 30 days from date of such notification in which to submit its  revisions. In the event more time is required in which to place the  revisions into effect, the Regional Administrator may conditionally  approve the State administrative plan or annual submission subject to  the specified conditions to be met within a specified time, as agreed by  the State and FEMA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Appeals. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appeal from a Regional Administrator's disapproval  of a   State administrative plan or an annual submission or other final action  as unjustified under the criteria in CPG 1-3 may be made by letter to  the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate,  signed by an authorized State official and submitted through the  Regional Administrator. Such appeal letter shall be mailed or otherwise  transmitted so as to reach the Regional Administrator within 30 days  after receipt of the notification of disapproval. Failure to file its  appeal on time may result in withdrawal of the State's allocation and  the proposed funding being reallocated by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A local jurisdiction that regards the final action on its  subgrant made by a State as unjustified under the criteria in CPG 1-3  may submit an appeal through the State to the Regional Administrator.  Upon receipt of such an appeal, the RegionalAdministrator shall forward  the letter, together with all available pertinent documentation from the  Regional Administrator's files and any additional documentation  submitted by the local jurisdiction in support of its appeal, to the  Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate, for  review and determination. The appeal shall contain all of the exceptions  being taken by the State or local jurisdiction, and no exceptions will  be determined piecemeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No portion of the appellant State's allocation shall be  reallocated by FEMA, and no portion of a local jurisdiction's allocation  shall be reallocated by the State, pending determination of its appeal  by the Administrator.
