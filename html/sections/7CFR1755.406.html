                                Sec. 1755.406  Shield or armor ground resistance measurements.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Shield or armor ground resistance measurements shall be made on  completed lengths of copper cable and wire plant and fiber optic cable  plant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method of measurement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The shield or armor ground resistance  measurement shall be made between the copper cable and wire shield and  ground and between the fiber optic cable armor and ground, respectively.  The measurement shall be made either on cable and wire lengths before  splicing and before any ground connections are made to the cable or wire  shields or armors. Optionally, the measurement may be made on cable and  wire lengths after splicing, but all ground connections must be removed  from the section under test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The method of measurement using either an insulation resistance  test set or a dc bridge type megohmmeter shall be as shown in Figure 18  as follows:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02MY97.040</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test equipment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The shield or armor ground resistance  measurements may be made using an insulation resistance test set, a dc  bridge type megohmmeter, or a commercially available fault locator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The insulation resistance test set should have an output voltage  not to exceed 500 volts dc and may be hand cranked or battery operated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The dc bridge type megohmmeter, which may be ac powered, should  have   scales and multipliers which make it possible to accurately read  resistance values of 50,000 ohms to 10 megohms. The voltage that is  applied to the shield or armor during the test should not be less than  ``250 volts dc'' nor greater than ``1,000 volts dc'' when using an  instrument having adjustable test voltage levels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Commercially available fault locators may be used in lieu of the  above equipment, if the devices are capable of detecting faults having  resistance values of 50,000 ohms to 10 megohms. Operation of the devices  and method of locating the faults should be in accordance with  manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicable results. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For all new copper cable and wire  facilities and all new fiber optic cable facilities, the shield or armor  ground resistance levels normally exceed 1 megohm-mile (1.6 megohm-km)  at 68 F (20 C). A value of 100,000 ohm-mile (161,000 ohm-km) at 68 F  (20 C) shall be the minimum acceptable value of the shield or armor  ground resistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shield or armor ground resistance varies inversely with length  and temperature. In addition other factors which may affect readings  could be soil conditions, faulty test equipment and incorrect test  procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the resistance test method and dc bridge type megohmmeter,  the ohm-mile (ohm-km) value for the shield or armor ground resistance  shall be computed by multiplying the actual scale reading in ohms on the  test set by the length in miles (km) of the cable or wire under test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The objective shield or armor ground resistance may be  determined by dividing 100,000 by the length in miles (161,000 by the  length in km) of the cable or wire under test. The resulting value is  the minimum acceptable meter scale reading in ohms. Examples for  paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section are as follows:  Equation 1. Test Set: Scale Reading * Length = Resistance-Length 75,000 ohms * 3 miles = 225,000 ohm-mile (75,000 ohms * 4.9 km = 367,000 ohm-km)  Equation 2. 100,000 ohm-mile / Length = Minimum Acceptable Meter Scale  Reading 100,000 ohm-mile / 3 miles = 33,333 ohms (161,000 ohm-km / 4.9 km = 32,857 ohms)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Since the 33,333 ohms (32,857 ohms) is the minimum acceptable  meter scale reading and the meter scale reading was 75,000 ohms, the  cable is considered to have met the 100,000 ohm-mile (161,000 ohm-km)  requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Due to the differences between various jacketing materials used  in manufacturing cable or wire and to varying soil conditions, it is  impractical to provide simple factors to predict the magnitude of  variation in shield or armor to ground resistance due to temperature.  The variations can, however, be substantial for wide excursions in  temperature from the ambient temperature of 68 F (20 C).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Data record. The data shall be corrected to the length  requirement of ohm-mile (ohm-km) and a temperature of 68 F (20 C) and  shall be recorded on a form specified in the applicable construction  contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Probable causes for nonconformance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When results of  resistance measurements are below the 100,000 ohm-mile (161,000 ohm-km)  requirement at 68 F (20 C), the jacket temperature, soil conditions,  test equipment and method shall be reviewed before the cable or wire is  considered a failure. If the temperature is approximately 68 F (20 C)  and soil conditions are acceptable, and a reading of less than 100,000  ohm-mile (161,000 ohm-km) is indicated, check the calibration of the  equipment; as well as, the test method. If the equipment was found to be  out of calibration, recalibrate the equipment and remeasure the cable or  wire. If the temperature was 86 F (30 C) or higher, the cable or wire  shall be remeasured at a time when the temperature is approximately 68  F (20 C). If the test was performed in unusually wet soil, the cable  or wire shall be retested after the soil has reached normal conditions.  If after completion of the above steps, the resistance value of 100,000  ohm-mile (161,000 ohm-km) or greater is obtained, the cable or wire  shall be considered acceptable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the resistance value of the cable or wire is still found to  be below 100,000 ohm-mile (161,000 ohm-km) requirement after completion  of the steps listed in paragraph (f)(1) of this   section, the fault shall be isolated by performing shield or armor  ground resistance measurements on individual cable or wire sections.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Once the fault or faults have been isolated, the cable or wire  jacket shall be repaired in accordance with Sec. 1755.200, RUS Standard  for Splicing Copper and Fiber Optic Cables or the entire cable or wire  section may be replaced at the request of the borrower.
