                                8.405-2  Ordering procedures for services requiring a statement of work.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Ordering activities shall use the procedures in this  subsection when ordering services priced at hourly rates as established  by the schedule contracts. The applicable services will be identified in  the Federal Supply Schedule publications and the contractor's  pricelists. For establishing BPAs and for orders under BPAs see 8.405-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Statements of Work (SOWs). All Statements of Work shall include  a description of work to be performed; location of work; period of  performance; deliverable schedule; applicable performance standards; and  any special requirements (e.g., security clearances, travel, special  knowledge). To the maximum extent practicable, agency requirements shall  be performance-based statements (see subpart 37.6).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request for Quotation procedures. The ordering activity must  provide the Request for Quotation (RFQ), which includes the statement of  work and evaluation criteria (e.g., experience and past performance), to  schedule contractors that offer services that will meet the agency's  needs. The RFQ may be posted to GSA's electronic RFQ system, e-Buy (see  8.402(d)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Orders at, or below, the micro-purchase threshold. Ordering  activities may place orders at, or below, the micro-purchase threshold  with any Federal Supply Schedule contractor that can meet the agency's  needs. The ordering activity should attempt to distribute orders among  contractors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, but not  exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The ordering  activity shall develop a statement of work, in accordance with 8.405- 2(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ordering activity shall provide the RFQ (including the  statement of work and evaluation criteria) to at least three schedule  contractors that offer services that will meet the agency's needs or  document the circumstances for restricting consideration to fewer than  three schedule contractors based on one of the reasons at 8.405-6(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The ordering activity shall specify the type of order (i.e.,  firm-fixed-price, labor-hour) for the services identified in the  statement of work. The contracting officer should establish firm-fixed- prices, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For proposed orders exceeding the simplified acquisition  threshold. In addition to meeting the requirements of 8.405-2(c)(2)(i)  and (iii), the following procedures apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each order shall be placed on a competitive basis in accordance  with (c)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, unless this requirement is  waived on the basis of a justification that is prepared and approved in  accordance with 8.405-6.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ordering activity contracting officer shall provide an RFQ  that includes a statement of work and the evaluation criteria.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The ordering activity contracting officer shall--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Post the RFQ on e-Buy to afford all schedule contractors  offering the required services under the appropriate multiple-award  schedule(s) an opportunity to submit a quote; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Provide the RFQ to as many schedule contractors as practicable,  consistent with market research appropriate to the circumstances, to  reasonably ensure that quotes will be received from at least three  contractors that can fulfill the requirements. When fewer than three  quotes are received from schedule contractors that can fulfill the  requirements, the contracting officer shall prepare a written  determination to explain that no additional contractors capable of  fulfilling the requirements could be identified despite reasonable  efforts to do so. The determination must clearly explain efforts made to  obtain quotes from at least three schedule contractors.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Ensure all quotes received are fairly considered and award is  made in accordance with the evaluation criteria in the RFQ.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The ordering activity shall provide the RFQ (including the  statement of work and the evaluation criteria) to any schedule  contractor who requests a copy of it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> and 8.405-4). After award, ordering activities  should provide timely notification to unsuccessful offerors. If an  unsuccessful offeror requests information on an award that was based on  factors other than price alone, a brief explanation of the basis for the  award decision shall be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use of time-and-materials and labor-hour orders for services.  When placing a time-and-materials or labor-hour order for services, see  8.404(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Minimum documentation. The ordering activity shall document--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The schedule contracts considered, noting the contractor from  which the service was purchased;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the service purchased;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount paid;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The evaluation methodology used in selecting the contractor to  receive the order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The rationale for any tradeoffs in making the selection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The price reasonableness determination required by paragraph (d)  of this subsection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The rationale for using other than--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A firm-fixed price order; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A performance-based order; and .</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> When an order exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold,  evidence of compliance with the ordering procedures at 8.405-2(c).
