Program operators  and training providers must coordinate funds available to pay for  training as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Program operators must coordinate training funds available and  make funding arrangements with One-Stop partners and other entities to  apply the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. Training  providers must consider the availability of other sources of grants to  pay for training costs such as Welfare-to-Work, State-funded training  funds, and Federal Pell Grants, so that WIA funds supplement other  sources of training grants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A WIA participant may enroll in WIA-funded training while his/ her application for a Pell Grant is pending as long as the One-Stop  operator has made arrangements with the training provider and the WIA  participant regarding allocation of the Pell Grant, if it is  subsequently awarded. In that case, the training provider must reimburse  the One-Stop operator the WIA funds used to underwrite the training for  the amount the Pell Grant covers. Reimbursement is not required from the  portion of Pell Grant assistance disbursed to the WIA participant for  education-related expenses. (WIA sec. 134(d)(4)(B).)</p>
