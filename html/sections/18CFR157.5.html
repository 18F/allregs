Applications for  permission and approval to abandon pursuant to section 7(b) of the Act  shall conform to Sec. 157.18 and to such other requirements of this  part as may be pertinent. However, every applicant shall file all  pertinent data and information necessary for a full and complete  understanding of the proposed project, including its effect upon  applicant's present and future operations and whether, and at what  docket, applicant has previously applied for authorization to serve any  portion of the market contemplated by the proposed project and the  nature and disposition of such other project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Every requirement of this part shall be considered as a  forthright obligation of the applicant which can only be avoided by a  definite and positive showing that the information or data called for by  the applicable rules is not necessary for the consideration and ultimate  determination of the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This part will be strictly applied to all applications as  submitted and the burden of adequate presentation in intelligible form  as well as justification for omitted data or information rests with the  applicant.
