                            <p class="depth0">Each operating range used during the test shall be checked prior to and after each test in accordance with the following procedure. (A chronic need for parameter adjustment can indicate a need for instrument maintenance.):</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The calibration is checked by using a zero gas and a span gas whose nominal value is between 75 percent and 100 percent of full-scale, inclusive, of the measuring range.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After the end of the final mode, a zero gas and the same span gas will be used for rechecking. As an option, the zero and span may be rechecked at the end of each mode or each test segment. The analysis will be considered acceptable if the difference between the two measuring results is less than 2 percent of full scale.
