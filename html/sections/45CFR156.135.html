                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Calculation of AV. Subject to paragraphs (b) and (d) of this  section, to calculate the AV of a health plan, the issuer must use the  AV Calculator developed and made available by HHS for the given benefit  year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception to the use of the AV Calculator. If a health plan's  design is not compatible with the AV Calculator, the issuer must meet  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submit the actuarial certification from an actuary, who is a  member of the American Academy of Actuaries, on the chosen methodology  identified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculate the plan's AV by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Estimating a fit of its plan design into the parameters of the  AV Calculator; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Having an actuary, who is a member of the American Academy of  Actuaries, certify that the plan design was fit appropriately in  accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and  methodologies; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use the AV Calculator to determine the AV for the plan  provisions that fit within the calculator parameters and have an  actuary, who is a member of the American Academy of Actuaries calculate  and certify, in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles  and methodologies, appropriate adjustments to the AV identified by the  calculator, for plan design features that deviate substantially from the  parameters of the AV Calculator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The calculation methods described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3)  of this section may include only in-network cost-sharing, including  multi-tier networks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Employer contributions to health savings accounts and amounts  made available under certain health reimbursement arrangements. For  plans other than those in the individual market that at the time of  purchase are offered in conjunction with an HSA or with integrated HRAs  that may be used only for cost-sharing, annual employer contributions to  HSAs and amounts newly made available under such HRAs for the current  year are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Counted towards the total anticipated medical spending of the  standard population that is paid by the health plan; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjusted to reflect the expected spending for health care costs  in a benefit year so that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any current year HSA contributions are accounted for; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amounts newly made available under such integrated HRAs for  the current year are accounted for.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of state-specific standard population for the calculation of  AV. Beginning in 2015, if submitted by the State and approved by HHS, a  state-specific data set will be used as the standard population to  calculate AV in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The data  set may be approved by HHS if it is submitted in accordance with  paragraph (e) of this section and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Supports the calculation of AVs for the full range of health  plans available in the market;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is derived from a non-elderly population and estimates those  likely to be covered by private health plans on or after January 1,  2014;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is large enough that: (i) The demographic and spending patterns  are stable over time; and (ii) Includes a substantial majority of the  State's insured population, subject to the requirement in paragraph  (d)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is a statistically reliable and stable basis for area-specific  calculations; and (5) Contains claims data on health care services  typically offered in the then-current market.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Submission of state-specific data. AV will be calculated using  the default standard population described in paragraph (f) of this  section, unless a data set in a format specified by HHS that   can support the use of the AV Calculator as described in paragraph (a)  of this section is submitted by a State and approved by HHS consistent  with paragraph (d) of this section by a date specified by HHS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Default standard population. The default standard population for  AV calculation will be developed and summary statistics, such as in  continuance tables, will be provided by HHS in a format that supports  the calculation of AV as described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Updates to the AV Calculator. HHS will update the AV Calculator  as follows, HHS will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Update the annual limit on cost sharing and related functions  based on a projected estimate to enable the AV Calculator to comply with  Sec. 156.130(a)(2);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Update the continuance tables to reflect more current enrollment  data when HHS has determined that the enrolled population has materially  changed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Update the algorithms when HHS has determined the need to adapt  the AV Calculator for use by additional plan designs or to allow the AV  Calculator to accommodate potential new types of plan designs, where  such adaptations can be based on actuarially sound principles and will  not have a substantial effect on the AV calculations performed by the  then current AV Calculator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Update the continuance tables to reflect more current claims  data no more than every 3 and no less than every 5 years and to annually  trend the claims data when the trending factor is more than 5 percent  different, calculated on a cumulative basis; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Update the AV Calculator user interface when a change would be  useful to a broad group of users of the AV Calculator, would not affect  the function of the AV Calculator, and would be technically feasible.
