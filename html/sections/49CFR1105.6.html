For actions that generally require no  environmental documentation, the Board may decide that a particular  action has the potential for significant environmental impacts and that,  therefore, the applicant should provide an environmental report and  either an EA or an EIS will be prepared. For actions generally requiring  an EA, the Board may prepare a full EIS where the probability of  significant impacts from the particular proposal is high enough to  warrant an EIS. Alternatively, in a rail construction, an applicant can  seek to demonstrate (with supporting information addressing the  pertinent aspects of Sec.  1105.7(e)) that an EA, rather than an EIS,  will be sufficient because the particular proposal is not likely to have  a significant environmental impact. Any request for reclassification  must be in writing and, in a rail construction, should be presented with  the prefiling notice required by Sec.  1105.10(a)(1) (or a request to  waive that prefiling notice period).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The classifications in this section apply without regard to  whether the   action is proposed by application, petition, notice of exemption, or any  other means that initiates a formal Board proceeding.</p>
