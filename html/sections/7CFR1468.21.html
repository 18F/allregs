                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To apply for enrollment under a new agreement or if applicable, under an existing agreement in a subsequent fiscal year, an eligible entity must submit an entity application for an ACEP-ALE agreement and any associated individual parcel applications to NRCS in the State where parcels are located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applications may be submitted on a continuous basis or in response to specific program solicitations. NRCS may announce one or more application cut-off dates for funding consideration within a given fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> NRCS will determine the entity, land, and landowner eligibility based on the application materials provided

by the eligible entity, onsite assessments, and the criteria set forth in Sec. 1468.20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> At the end of each fiscal year, the lists of pending, unfunded eligible parcels will be cancelled unless the eligible entity requests that specific parcels be considered for funding in the next fiscal year and provides updated application information to NRCS.


Sec. 1468.22   Establishing priorities, ranking considerations andproject selection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> After NRCS determines the eligibility of the landowner and the land, it can score and rank the parcels for funding. NRCS will use national and State criteria to score and rank eligible parcels. The national ranking criteria will comprise at least half of the ranking score. The State criteria will be developed by NRCS on a State-by-State basis, with advice from the State Technical Committee. Eligible parcels are ranked at the State level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The national ranking criteria are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Percent of prime, unique, and other important farmland in the parcel to be protected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Percent of cropland, rangeland, grassland, historic grassland, pastureland, or nonindustrial private forest land in the parcel to be protected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ratio of the total acres of land in the parcel to be protected to average farm size in the county according to the most recent USDA Census of Agriculture;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Decrease in the percentage of acreage of farm and ranch land in the county in which the parcel is located between the last two USDA Censuses of Agriculture;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Percent population growth in the county as documented by the United States Census;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Population density (population per square mile) as documented by the most recent United States Census;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Existence of a farm or ranch succession plan or similar plan established to address farm viability for future generations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Proximity of the parcel to other protected land, such as military installations; land owned in fee title by the United States or an Indian Tribe, State or local government, or by a nongovernmental organization whose purpose is to protect agricultural use and related conservation values; or land that is already subject to an easement or deed restriction that limits the conversion of the land to nonagricultural use;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Proximity of the parcel to other agricultural operations and agricultural infrastructure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Maximizing the protection of contiguous acres devoted to agricultural use;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Whether the land is currently enrolled in CRP in a contract that is set to expire within one year and is grassland that would benefit from protection under a long-term easement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Other additional criteria as determined by NRCS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> State or local criteria as determined by NRCS, with advice of the State Technical Committee, may only include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The location of a parcel in an area zoned for agricultural use;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The eligible entity's performance in managing and enforcing easements. Performance must be measured by the efficiency by which easement transactions are completed or percentage of parcels that have been monitored and the percentage of monitoring results that have been reported;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Multifunctional benefits of farm and ranch land protection including social, economic, historical and archaeological, environmental benefits, species protection, or climate change resiliency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Geographic regions where the enrollment of particular lands may help achieve national, State, and regional conservation goals and objectives, or enhance existing government or private conservation projects;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Diversity of natural resources to be protected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Score in the land evaluation and site assessment system or equivalent measure for grassland enrollments. This score serves as a measure of agricultural viability (access to markets and infrastructure); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Other criteria determined by NRCS that will allow for the selection of parcels that will achieve ACEP-ALE purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If NRCS determines that the purchase of two or more agricultural land easements are comparable in achieving program goals, NRCS will not assign a higher priority to any one of these agricultural land easements solely on the basis of lesser cost to the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> NRCS will rank all eligible parcels that have been submitted prior to an application cut-off date in accordance with the national and State ranking criteria before selecting parcels for inclusion in a cooperative agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> NRCS will list the selected eligible parcels in the cooperative agreements with the eligible entities that submitted the parcels, and the cooperative agreements will be signed by NRCS and eligible entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> If the terms of the cooperative agreement allow for amendments in a subsequent fiscal year, the subsequent fiscal year's selected eligible parcels will be identified on an amendment to the cooperative agreement for that fiscal year. Funds for each subsequent fiscal year's parcels will be obligated with new NRCS and eligible entity signatures on each fiscal year's amendment. Parcels funded on each fiscal year's amendment will have a separate deadline for easement purchase, requesting reimbursement, and funding expiration.</p>
