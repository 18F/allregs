In the event that they fail to reach agreement concerning the granting of a permit for the vending stand, the modification or revocation of a permit, the suitability of the stand location, the assignment of vending proceeds, the methods of operation of the stand, or other terms of the permit (including articles which may be sold) the State licensing agency shall have the right of appeal to the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals. Such appeals shall be made in writing and shall be filed in the Office of the Director (address: Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, 801 North Quincy Street, Arlington, VA 22203) within 15 days from the date of notice of the decision from which the appeal is taken. Such appeals shall comply otherwise with the general rules of the Office of Hearings and Appeals in subpart B of part 4 of this title and with the special regulations set forth in subpart G of part 4 of this title applicable to proceedings in appeals cases which do not lie within the appellate jurisdiction of an established Appeals Board of the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Upon appeal, full investigation shall be undertaken. A full report shall be obtained from the Interior representative from whose decision the appeal is being taken. The State licensing agency shall be given opportunity to present information. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare shall be available for general advice on program activities and objectives. A final decision of the Director, Office f Hearings and Appeals, or of an Ad Hoc Appeals Board appointed by him to consider the appeal and to issue decision thereon, shall be rendered within ninety days of the filing of the appeal. Notification of the decision on appeal and the action taken thereon shall be given to the State licensing agency and to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The decision of the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, or of an Ad Hoc Appeals Board appointed by him, shall be final. At the end of each fiscal year the Office of the Secretary shall report to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare the total number of applications for vending stand locations received from State licensing agencies, the number accepted, the number denied, and the number still pending.
