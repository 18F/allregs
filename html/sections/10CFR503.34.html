                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility. Section 212(a)(1)(C) of the Act provides for a permanent exemption due to the inability to comply with applicable environmental requirements. To qualify, a petitioner must demonstrate that despite good faith efforts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The petitioner will be unable within 5 years after beginning operation, to comply with the applicable prohibitions imposed by the Act without violating applicable Federal or state environmental requirements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable alternative sites, which would permit the use of alternate fuels in compliance with applicable Federal or state environmental requirements, are not available.</p><p class="depth0">Note: (1) For purposes of considering an exemption under this section, OFE's decision will be based solely on an analysis of the petitioner's capacity to physically achieve applicable environmental requirements. The cost of compliance is not relevant, but cost-related considerations may be presented as part of a demonstration submitted under Sec. 503.32 (Lack of alternate fuel supply).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prior to deciding to submit an exemption petition, it is recommended that a petitioner request a meeting with OFE and EPA or the appropriate state or local regulatory agency to discuss options for operating an alternate fuel-fired facility in compliance with the applicable environmental requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Evidence required in support of a petition. The petitioner must include in the petition the following evidence in order to make the demonstration required by this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where the petitioner has applied for a construction permit from EPA or an appropriate state agency prior to petitioning for an exemption from OFE under this section, a copy of such application and a synopsis of all supporting documents filed with or subsequent to the application must be submitted to OFE with the petition or at the time filed with the permitting agency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To the extent applicable, a copy of the EPA or state denial of the construction permit application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To the extent applicable, a synopsis of the administrative record of the EPA or state or local permit proceedings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To the extent applicable, a summary of the technology upon which the denial was based, including a performance comparison between the proposed technology and that technology which

provides the maximum possible reduction of pollution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> An examination of the environmental compliance of the facility, including an analysis of its ability to meet applicable standards and criteria when using both the proposed fuel and the alternate fuel(s) which would provide the basis for the exemption. All such analysis must be based on accepted analytical techniques, such as air quality modeling, and reflect current conditions of the area which would be affected by the facility. The petitioner is responsible for obtaining the necessary data to accurately characterize these conditions. Environmental compliance must be examined in the context of available pollution control equipment which would provide the maximum possible reduction of pollution. The analysis must contain: (i) Requests for bids and other inquiries made and responses received by the petitioner concerning the availability and performance of pollution control equipment; or (ii) other comparable evidence such as technical studies documenting the efficacy of equipment to meet applicable requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> An examination of any regulatory options available to the petitioner in seeking to achieve environmental compliance (such as offsets, variances and State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Any other documentation which demonstrates an inability to comply with applicable environmental requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> No alternate power supply exists as required under Sec. 503.8 of these regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Use of mixtures is not feasible, as required under Sec. 503.9 of these regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Alternative sites are not available, as required under Sec. 503.11 of these regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Environmental impact analysis, as required under Sec. 503.13 of these regulations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Fuels search, as required under Sec. 503.14 of these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Certification alternative. (1) To qualify for this exemption, in lieu of meeting the evidentiary requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, a petitioner may certify that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To qualify for this exemption, in lieu of meeting the evidentiary requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, a petitioner may certify that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The site for the facility is or will be located in a Class I area or Class II area in which the allowable increment established by law has been consumed, as defined in part C of the Clean Air Act; the use of an alternate fuel will cause or contribute to concentrations of pollutants which would exceed the maximum allowable increases in a Class I or Class II area even with the application of best available control technology; the site for the facility is or will be located in a non-attainment area as defined in part D of the Clean Air Act for any pollutant which would be emitted by the facility; or, even with the application of the lowest achievable emission rate, the use of an alternate fuel will cause or contribute to concentrations in an air quality control region of a pollutant for which any national ambient air quality standard is or would be exceeded;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No alternate power supply exists, as required under Sec. 503.8 of these regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternative sites are not available, as required under Sec. 503.11 of these regulations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Use of mixtures is not feasible, as required under Sec. 503.19 of these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A petition by certification under this paragraph must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Duly executed certifications required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exhibits containing the basis for the certifications required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section (including those factual and analytical materials deemed by the petitioner to be sufficient to support the granting of this exemption);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Environmental impact analysis, as required under Sec. 503.13 of these regulations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fuels search, as required under Sec. 503.14 of these regulations.
