                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prohibition. No covered employee shall perform services, either  on a paid or unpaid basis, for any System institution or related entity,  or any officer, director, employee, or person connected with a System  institution or related entity. Nothing in this section would prohibit  covered employees from providing any service that is a part of their  official duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General requirement for prior approval. All employees shall  obtain prior written approval before engaging in any outside employment  or business activity, with or without compensation, unless the outside  activity is exempt from the definition of ``employment'' as set forth in  paragraph (c) of this section. An employee proposing to engage in  outside employment and business activities is required, prior to  commencement, to send a written notice of the proposed employment or  activity to the DAEO on a form prescribed by the DAEO. Approval shall be  granted only upon a determination that the employment or activity is not  expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute, part 2635 of this  title, or paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definition. For purposes of this section, ``employment'' means  any form of non-Federal employment, business relationship or activity  involving the provision of personal services by the employee, whether or  not for compensation. It includes, but is not limited to, personal  services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant,  contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, or speaker. It includes  writing when done under an arrangement with another person for  production or publication of the written product. It does not, however,  include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable,  religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational,  public service, or civic organization for which no compensation is  received other than reimbursement for necessary expenses.</p>
