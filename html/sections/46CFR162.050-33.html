Emulsions and/or the type of oil must not affect the ppm display. Calibrating the bilge alarm must not be necessary once installed on board the vessel, however, onboard testing in accordance with the manufacturer's operating instructions is permitted for the purposes of checking instrument drift and repeatability of the instrument reading, as well as the ability to re-zero the instrument. The accuracy of the readings must at all times remain within the limits described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each bilge alarm must be designed so that it displays each change

The recording device must also store data for at least 18 months and be able to display or print a protocol. In the event the 15 ppm bilge alarm is replaced, means must be provided to ensure the data recorded remains available on board for 18 months.
