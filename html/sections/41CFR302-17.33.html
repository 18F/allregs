                                Sec.  302-17.33  May I ask my agency to recalculate my RITA?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Yes, you may ask your agency to recalculate your RITA provided  you filed your ``Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,'' and  amended it, if necessary, in a timely manner. If, once you have  completed all Federal, state, and local tax returns, you believe that  your RITA should have been significantly different from the RITA that  your agency calculated, you may ask your agency to recalculate your  RITA. This is true for either the one-year or two-year process. With any  request for recalculation, you must submit a statement explaining why  you believe your RITA was incorrect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Please note that your agency may require that you also submit an  amended ``Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status'' (if, for example,  you inadvertently did not report some of your income in your original  Statement), your actual tax returns, or both, as attachments to your  request for recalculation.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec.  302-17.33: Please see Sec.  302-17.55, if your agency  uses a one-year RITA process, or Sec.  302-17.68, if your agency uses a  two-year RITA process, for more information about positive and negative  RITA calculations.</p>
