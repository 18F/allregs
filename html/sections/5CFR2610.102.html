                            <p class="depth0">The Act provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses  to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain  administrative proceedings (``adversary adjudications'') before the  Office of Government Ethics. An eligible party may receive an award when  it prevails over the Office, unless the Office's position in the  proceeding was substantially justified or special circumstances make an  award unjust. An eligible party may also receive an award when the  demand of the Office is substantially in excess of the decision in the  adversary adjudication and is unreasonable when compared with such  decision, under the facts and circumstances of the case, unless the  party has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad  faith or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this  part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that  are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the  procedures and standards that the Office will use to make them.  [57 FR 33268, July 28, 1992, as amended at 63 FR 13116, Mar. 18, 1998]</p>
