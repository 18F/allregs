For this purpose:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``defaulted principal amount outstanding'' means the  total amount borrowed from the loan fund of a school that has reached  the repayment stage (minus any principal amount repaid or canceled) on  loans in default for more than 120 days; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term ``matured loans'' means the total principal amount of  all loans made by a school under this subpart minus the total principal  amount of loans made by the school to students who are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Enrolled in a full-time or half-time course of study at the  school; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In their grace period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any school that has a default rate greater than 5 percent on  June 30, 1986, or on June 30 of any year thereafter will be required to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reduce its default rate by 50 percent (or a school with a  default rate below 10 percent must reduce its rate to 5 percent) by the  close of the following 6-month period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By the end of each succeeding 6-month period, reduce its default  rate to 50 percent of the required rate for the previous 6-month period,  until it reaches 5 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any school subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this  section which fails to comply with those requirements will receive no  new NSL funds and will be required to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Place the revolving fund monies and all subsequent collections  into an insured interest-bearing account;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Make no loan disbursements; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this  section will be permitted to resume the use of its NSL funds, but must  continue to comply with the requirements of subparagraph (b)(2) of this  section if its delinquency rate is still greater than 5 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any school subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this  section which fails to comply with those requirements will be subject to  termination.

If the school requests  a hearing, it must within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit  material, factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause  for a hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The  hearing will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.
