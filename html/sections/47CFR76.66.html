                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Satellite carrier. A satellite carrier is an  entity that uses the facilities of a satellite or satellite service  licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, and operates in the  Fixed-Satellite Service under part 25 of title 47 of the Code of Federal  Regulations or the Direct Broadcast Satellite Service under part 100 of  title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, to establish and operate a  channel of communications for point-to-multipoint distribution of  television station signals, and that owns or leases a capacity or a  service on a satellite in order to provide such point-to-multipoint  distribution, except to the extent that such entity provides such  distribution pursuant to tariff under the Communications Act of 1934,  other than for private home viewing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Secondary transmission. A secondary transmission is the further  transmitting of a primary transmission simultaneously with the primary  transmission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subscriber. A subscriber is a person who receives a secondary  transmission service from a satellite carrier and pays a fee for the  service, directly or indirectly, to the satellite carrier or to a  distributor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Television broadcast station. A television broadcast station is  an over-the-air commercial or noncommercial television broadcast station  licensed by the Commission under subpart E of part 73 of title 47, Code  of Federal Regulations, except that such term does not include a low- power or translator television station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Television network. For purposes of this section, a television  network is an entity which offers an interconnected program service on a  regular basis for 15 or more hours per week to at least 25 affiliated  broadcast stations in 10 or more States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Local-into-local television service. A satellite carrier is  providing local-into-local service when it retransmits a local  television station signal back into the local market of that television  station for reception by subscribers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Signal carriage obligations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each satellite carrier  providing, under section 122 of title 17, United States Code, secondary  transmissions to subscribers located within the local market of a  television broadcast station of a primary transmission made by that  station, shall carry upon request the signals of all television  broadcast stations located within that local market, subject to section  325(b) of title 47, United States Code, and other paragraphs in this  section. Satellite carriers are required to carry digital-only stations  upon request in markets in which the satellite carrier is providing any  local-into-local service pursuant to the statutory copyright license.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A satellite carrier that offers multichannel video programming  distribution service in the United States to more than 5,000,000  subscribers shall, no later than December 8, 2005, carry upon request  the signal originating as an analog signal of each television broadcast  station that is located in a local market in Alaska or Hawaii; and  shall, no later than June 8, 2007, carry upon request the signals  originating as digital signals of each television broadcast station that  is located in a local market in Alaska or Hawaii. Such satellite carrier  is not required to carry the signal originating as analog after  commencing carriage of digital signals on June 8, 2007. Carriage of  signals originating as digital signals of each television broadcast  station that is located in a local market in Alaska or Hawaii shall  include the entire free over-the-air signal, including multicast and  high definition digital signals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Election cycle. In television markets where a satellite carrier  is providing local-into-local service, a commercial television broadcast  station may elect either retransmission consent, pursuant to section 325  of title 47 United States Code, or mandatory carriage, pursuant to  section 338, title 47 United States Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The first retransmission consent-mandatory carriage election  cycle shall be for a four-year period commencing on January 1, 2002 and  ending December 31, 2005.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The second retransmission consent-mandatory carriage election  cycle, and all cycles thereafter, shall be for a period of three years  (e.g. the second election cycle commences on   January 1, 2006 and ends at midnight on December 31, 2008).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A commercial television station must notify a satellite carrier,  by July 1, 2001, of its retransmission consent-mandatory carriage  election for the first election cycle commencing January 1, 2002.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(6), (d)(2) and (d)(3) of  this section, local commercial television broadcast stations shall make  their retransmission consent-mandatory carriage election by October 1st  of the year preceding the new cycle for all election cycles after the  first election cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A noncommercial television station must request carriage by July  1, 2001 for the first election cycle and must renew its carriage request  at the same time a commercial television station must make its  retransmission consent-mandatory carriage election for all subsequent  cycles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A commercial television broadcast station located in a local  market in Alaska or Hawaii shall make its retransmission consent- mandatory carriage election by October 1, 2005, for carriage of its  signal that originates as an analog signal for carriage commencing on  December 8, 2005, and by April 1, 2007, for its signal that originates  as a digital signal for carriage commencing on June 8, 2007 and ending  on December 31, 2008. For analog and digital signal carriage cycles  commencing after December 31, 2008, such stations shall follow the  election cycle in paragraphs (c)(2) and (4). A noncommercial television  broadcast station located in a local market in Alaska or Hawaii must  request carriage by October 1, 2005, for carriage of its signal that  originates as an analog signal for carriage commencing on December 8,  2005, and by April 1, 2007, for its signal that originates as a digital  signal for carriage commencing on June 8, 2007 and ending on December  31, 2008.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Carriage procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Carriage requests. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An election for  mandatory carriage made by a television broadcast station shall be  treated as a request for carriage.

The 2003-2004 Nielsen  Station Index Directory and Nielsen Station Index United States  Television Household Estimates shall be used for the second  retransmission consent-mandatory carriage election cycle commencing  January 1, 2006 and ending December 31, 2008, and so forth for each  triennial election pursuant to this section. Provided, however, that a  county deleted from a market by Nielsen need not be subtracted from a  market in which a satellite carrier provides local-into-local service,  if that county is assigned to that market in the 1999-2000 Nielsen  Station Index Directory or any subsequent issue of that publication. A  satellite carrier may determine which local market in the State of  Alaska will be deemed to be the relevant local market in connection with  each subscriber in an area in the State of Alaska that is outside of a  designated market, as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A local market includes all counties to which stations assigned  to that market are licensed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Receive facilities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A local receive facility is the  reception point in each local market which a satellite carrier  designates for delivery of the signal of the station for purposes of  retransmission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A satellite carrier may establish another receive facility to  serve a market if the location of such a facility is acceptable to at  least one-half the stations with carriage rights in that market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in 76.66(d)(2), a satellite carrier providing  local-into-local service must notify local television stations of the  location of the receive facility by June 1, 2001 for the first election  cycle and at least 120   days prior to the commencement of all election cycles thereafter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A satellite carrier may relocate its local receive facility at  the commencement of each election cycle. A satellite carrier is also  permitted to relocate its local receive facility during the course of an  election cycle, if it bears the signal delivery costs of the television  stations affected by such a move. A satellite carrier relocating its  local receive facility must provide 60 days notice to all local  television stations carried in the affected television market.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Good quality signal. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A television station asserting its  right to carriage shall be required to bear the costs associated with  delivering a good quality signal to the designated local receive  facility of the satellite carrier or to another facility that is  acceptable to at least one-half the stations asserting the right to  carriage in the local market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To be considered a good quality signal for satellite carriage  purposes, a television station shall deliver to the local receive  facility of a satellite carrier either a signal level of -45dBm for UHF  signals or -49dBm for VHF signals at the input terminals of the signal  processing equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A satellite carrier is not required to carry a television  station that does not agree to be responsible for the costs of  delivering a good quality signal to the receive facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Duplicating signals. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A satellite carrier shall not be  required to carry upon request the signal of any local television  broadcast station that substantially duplicates the signal of another  local television broadcast station which is secondarily transmitted by  the satellite carrier within the same local market, or the signals of  more than one local commercial television broadcast station in a single  local market that is affiliated with a particular television network  unless such stations are licensed to communities in different States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A satellite carrier may select which duplicating signal in a  market it shall carry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A satellite carrier may select which network affiliate in a  market it shall carry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A satellite carrier is permitted to drop a local television  station whenever that station meets the substantial duplication criteria  set forth in this paragraph.

For noncommercial  educational television stations, a satellite carrier must also carry any  program-related material that may be necessary for receipt of  programming by persons with disabilities or for educational or language  purposes. Secondary audio programming must also be carried. Where  appropriate and feasible, satellite carriers may delete signal  enhancements, such as ghost-canceling, from the broadcast signal and  employ such enhancements at the local receive facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A satellite carrier, at its discretion, may carry any ancillary  service transmission on the vertical blanking interval or the aural  baseband of any television broadcast signal, including, but not limited  to, multichannel television sound and teletext.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Material degradation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each local television station whose  signal is carried under mandatory carriage shall, to the extent  technically feasible and consistent with good engineering practice, be  provided with the same quality of signal processing provided to  television stations electing retransmission consent, including carriage  of HD signals in HD if any local station in the same market is carried  in HD. A satellite carrier is permitted to use reasonable digital  compression techniques in the carriage of local television stations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Satellite carriers must provide carriage of local stations' HD  signals if any local station in the same market is carried in HD,  pursuant to the following schedule:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In at least 15% of the markets in which they carry any station  pursuant to the statutory copyright license in HD by February 17, 2010;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In at least 30% of the markets in which they carry any station  pursuant to the statutory copyright license in HD no later than February  17, 2011;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In at least 60% of the markets in which they carry any station  pursuant to the statutory copyright license in HD no later than February  17, 2012; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In 100% of the markets in which they carry any station pursuant  to the statutory copyright license in HD by February 17, 2013.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Compensation for carriage. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A satellite carrier shall not  accept or request monetary payment or other valuable consideration in  exchange either for carriage of local television broadcast stations in  fulfillment of the mandatory carriage requirements of this section or  for channel positioning rights provided to such stations under this  section, except that any such station may be required to bear the costs  associated with delivering a good quality signal to the receive facility  of the satellite carrier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A satellite carrier may accept payments from a station pursuant  to a retransmission consent agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Remedies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever a local television broadcast station  believes that a satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations  under this section, such station shall notify the carrier, in writing,  of the alleged failure and identify its reasons for believing that the  satellite carrier failed to comply with such obligations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The satellite carrier shall, within 30 days after such written  notification,   respond in writing to such notification and comply with such obligations  or state its reasons for believing that it is in compliance with such  obligations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A local television broadcast station that disputes a response by  a satellite carrier that it is in compliance with such obligations may  obtain review of such denial or response by filing a complaint with the  Commission, in accordance with Sec.  76.7 of title 47, Code of Federal  Regulations. Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such  satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations and the basis for  such allegations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The satellite carrier against which a complaint is filed is  permitted to present data and arguments to establish that there has been  no failure to meet its obligations under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Commission shall determine whether the satellite carrier has  met its obligations under this section. If the Commission determines  that the satellite carrier has failed to meet such obligations, the  Commission shall order the satellite carrier to take appropriate  remedial action.
