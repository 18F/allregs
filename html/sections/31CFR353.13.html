                                Sec. 353.13  Employee plans--Conditions of eligibility.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition of plan. Employee thrift, savings, vacation and  similar plans are contributory plans established by the employer for the  exclusive and irrevocable benefit of its employees or their  beneficiaries. Each plan must afford employees the means of making  regular savings from their wages through payroll deductions and provide  for employer contributions to be added to these savings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition of terms used in this section. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term assets  means all the employees' contributions and assets purchased with them  and the employer's contributions and assets purchased with them, as well  as accretions, such as dividends on stock, the increment in value on  bonds and all other income; but, notwithstanding any other provision of  this section, the right to demand and receive all assets credited to the  account of an employee shall not be construed to require the  distribution of assets in kind when it would not be possible or  practicable to make such a distribution; for example, Series EE bonds  may not be reissued in unauthorized denominations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The word beneficiary means: (i) The person or persons, if any,  designated by the employee in accordance with the terms of the plan to  receive the benefits of the plan upon the employee's death or (ii) the  estate of the employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conditions of eligibility. An employee plan must conform to the  following rules in order to be eligible for the special limitation  provided in Sec. 353.10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Crediting of assets. All assets of a plan must be credited to  the individual accounts of participating employees and may be  distributed only to them or their beneficiaries, except as provided in  paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Purchase of bonds. Bonds may be purchased only with assets  credited to the accounts of participating employees and only if the  amount taken from any account at any time for that purpose is equal to  the purchase price of a bond or bonds in an authorized denomination or  denominations, and shares in the bonds are credited to the accounts of  the individuals from which the purchase price was derived, in amounts  corresponding with their shares. For example, if $50 credited to the  account of John Jones is commingled with funds credited to the accounts  of other employees to make a total of $5,000 with which a Series EE bond  in the denomination of $10,000 (face amount) is purchased in December  1980 and registered in the name and title of the trustee, the plan must  provide, in effect, that John Jones' account be credited to show that he  is the owner of a Series EE bond in the denomination of $100 (face  amount) bearing an issue date of December 1, 1980.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Irrevocable right of withdrawal. Each participating employee has  an irrevocable right to request and receive from the trustee all assets  credited to the employee's account (or their value, if the employee  prefers) without regard to any conditions other than the loss or  suspension of the privilege of participating further in the plan. A plan   may limit or modify such right in any manner required for qualification  of the plan under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as  amended (26 U.S.C. section 401).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rights of beneficiary. Upon the death of an employee, his or her  beneficiary shall have the absolute and unconditional right to demand  and receive from the trustee all assets credited to the account of the  employee or their value, if he or she so prefers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reissue or payment upon distribution. When settlement is made  with an employee or his or her beneficiary with respect to any bond  registered in the name and title of the plan trustee in which the  employee has a share, the bond must be paid or reissued to the extent of  the share. If an employee or the beneficiary is to receive distribution  in kind, bonds bearing the same issue dates as those credited to the  employee's account will be reissued in the name of the employee or the  employee's beneficiary to the extent entitled, in authorized  denominations, in any authorized form of registration, upon the request  and certification of the trustee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application for special limitation. A trustee of an employee  plan who desires to purchase bonds under the special limitation should  submit to the designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch a copy of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plan, (2) any instructions issued under the plan that  concern Series EE bonds, and (3) the trust agreement, in order to  establish the plan's eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Vacation plans. Savings bonds may be purchased under certain  vacation plans. Questions concerning the eligibility of these plans to  purchase bonds in excess of the general limitation should be addressed  to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26101.  (31 U.S.C. 3105 and 3121)  [44 FR 76441, Dec. 26, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 55458, Dec. 13, 1983;  59 FR 10541, Mar. 4, 1994; 63 FR 64551, Nov. 20, 1998]</p>
