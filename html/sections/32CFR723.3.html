                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The application for correction must be  submitted on DD 149 (Application for Correction of Military Record) or  exact facsimile thereof, and should be addressed to: Board for  Correction of Naval Records, Department of the Navy, 2 Navy Annex,  Washington, DC 20370-5100. Forms and other explanatory matter may be  obtained from the Board upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the  application shall be signed by the person requesting corrective action  with respect to his/her record and will either be sworn to or will  contain a provision to the effect that the statements submitted in the  application are made with full knowledge of the penalty provided by law  for making a false statement or claim. (18 U.S.C. 287 and 1001)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the record in question is that of a person who is incapable  of making application, or whose whereabouts is unknown, or when such  person is deceased, the application may be made by a spouse, parent,  heir, or legal representative. Proof of proper interest shall be  submitted with the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time limit for filing application. Applications for correction  of a record must be filed within 3 years after discovery of the alleged  error or injustice. Failure to file within the time prescribed may be  excused by the Board if it finds it would be in the interest of justice  to do so. If the application is filed more than 3 years after discovery  of the error or injustice, the application must set forth the reason why  the Board should find it in the interest of justice to excuse the  failure to file the application within the time prescribed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acceptance of applications. An application will be accepted for  consideration unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Board lacks jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Board lacks authority to grant effective relief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The applicant has failed to exhaust all available administrative  remedies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The applicant has failed to file an application within 3 years  after discovery of the alleged error or injustice and has not provided a  reason or reasons why the Board should find it in the interest of  justice to excuse the failure to file the application within the  prescribed 3-year period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other proceedings not stayed. Filing an application with the  Board shall not operate as a stay of any other proceedings being taken  with respect to the person involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Consideration of application. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each application accepted for  consideration and all pertinent evidence of record will be reviewed by a  three member panel sitting in executive session, to determine whether to  authorize a hearing, recommend that the records be corrected without a  hearing, or to deny the application without a hearing. This  determination will be made by majority vote.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Board may deny an application in executive session if it  determines that the evidence of record fails to demonstrate the  existence of probable material error or injustice. The   Board relies on a presumption of regularity to support the official  actions of public officers and, in the absence of substantial evidence  to the contrary, will presume that they have properly discharged their  official duties. Applicants have the burden of overcoming this  presumption but the Board will not deny an application solely because  the record was made by or at the direction of the President or the  Secretary in connection with proceedings other than proceedings of a  board for the correction of military or naval records. Denial of an  application on the grounds of insufficient evidence to demonstrate the  existence of probable material error or injustice is final subject to  the provisions for reconsideration contained in Sec. 723.9.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When an original application or a request for further  consideration of a previously denied application is denied without a  hearing, the Board's determination shall be made in writing and include  a brief statement of the grounds for denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The brief statement of the grounds for denial shall include the  reasons for the determination that relief should not be granted,  including the applicant's claims of constitutional, statutory and/or  regulatory violations that were rejected, together with all the  essential facts upon which the denial is based, including, if  applicable, factors required by regulation to be considered for  determination of the character of and reason for discharge. Further the  Board shall make a determination as to the applicability of the  provisions of the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (10 U.S.C. 1034)  if it is invoked by the applicant or reasonably raised by the evidence.  Attached to the statement shall be any advisory opinion considered by  the Board which is not fully set out in the statement. The applicant  will also be advised of reconsideration procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The statement of the grounds for denial, together with all  attachments, shall be furnished promptly to the applicant and counsel,  who shall also be informed that the name and final vote of each Board  member will be furnished or made available upon request. Classified or  privileged material will not be incorporated or attached to the Board  statement; rather, unclassified or nonprivileged summaries of such  material will be so used and written explanations for the substitution  will be provided to the applicant and counsel.</p>
