                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part implements the Housing Trust Fund (HTF) program  established under section 1338 of the Federal Housing Enterprises  Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended (12 U.S.C. 4501  et seq.) (the Act). In general, under the HTF program, HUD allocates  funds by formula to eligible States to increase and preserve the supply  of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, with primary  attention to rental housing for extremely low-income and very low-income  households, including homeless families.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 1337 of the Act requires a percentage of the unpaid  principal balance of total new business for the Federal Home Loan  Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage  Association (Fannie Mae) (collectively, the government-sponsored  enterprises or GSEs) to be setaside and allocated as a dedicated source  of annual funding for the HTF, unless allocations are suspended by the  Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the agency that  regulates the GSEs. These funds will be deposited into an HTF account  established in the Treasury of the United States by the Secretary of the  Treasury to carry out the HTF program. The Act also provides that the  HTF may be funded with amounts appropriated, transferred, or credited to  the HTF under other provisions of law.</p>
