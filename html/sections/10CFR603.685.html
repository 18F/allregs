                            <p class="depth0">For nonprofit participants, a TIA's requirements for vesting of title, use, management, and disposition of real property or equipment acquired under the award are the same as those that apply to the participant's other Federal assistance awards. Specifically, the requirements are those in:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> 10 CFR 600.231 and 600.232, for participants that are States and local governmental organizations; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> 10 CFR 600.132 and 600.134, for other nonprofit participants, with the exception of nonprofit GOCOs and FFRDCs that are exempted from the definition of ``recipient'' in 10 CFR 600.101. If a GOCO or FFRDC is a participant, the contracting officer must specify appropriate standards that conform as much as practicable with the requirements in its procurement contract. Note also that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the TIA is a cooperative agreement, 31 U.S.C. 6306 provides authority to vest title to tangible personal property in a nonprofit institution of higher education or in a nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research, without further obligation to the Federal Government; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A TIA therefore must specify any conditions on the vesting of title to real property or equipment acquired by any such nonprofit participant.</p>
