                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each architect-engineer evaluation board, whether permanent or  ad hoc (which may include preselection boards), shall consist of at  least three voting members who are Federal employees from the  appropriate program area or from Federal offices outside the program  area as appropriate. One member of each board shall be appointed  chairperson. Non-voting advisors may also be appointed, including  private practitioners in architecture, engineering and related  professions. The members of a permanent board shall be appointed for a  period of two years. Appointment shall be made by the following  authorities with copies of appointment memoranda furnished to the  appropriate contracting activity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assistant Secretary or equivalent for boards appointed at the  Headquarters level;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cognizant program office head for boards appointed at the  field level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conflict of interest. Each board member, whether voting or  nonvoting, shall be advised of, and presumed to be familiar with the  regulations at 24 CFR part 0, Standards of Conduct, regarding conflicts  of interest. If at any time during the selection process a board member  encounters a situation with one or more of the firms being considered  that might be or might appear to be a conflict of interest, he or she  will disqualify him or herself and call it to the attention of the  chairperson for resolution and proper action. The chairperson will refer  the matter to legal counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Confidentiality. The evaluation board is to be insulated from  outside pressures, to the extent practical. No person having knowledge  of the activities of the board shall divulge information concerning the  deliberations of the board to any other persons not having a need to  know such information.
