                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Department of Labor and Industry is the State agency  designated by the Governor to administer the plan throughout the State.  The plan defines the covered occupational safety and health issues as  defined by the Secretary of Labor in 29 CFR 1902.2(c)(1). The  commissioner of the Department of Labor and Industry adopted Federal  standards promulgated as of October 1972, effective in Minnesota,  February 1973. The commissioner will continue to adopt Federal standards  and will retain those Minnesota standards not covered by Federal  standards. The plan contains a list of the Federal standards adopted and  the State standards that will be retained. These standards will be  enforced according to current legislative authority in Minnesota prior  to the effective date of Minnesota's enabling legislation submitted as  part of the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the  Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The legislation further proposed to bring the plan into  conformity with the requirements of 29 CFR part 1902 in areas such as  procedures for granting or denying temporary and permanent variances by  the commissioner; protection of employees from hazards; procedures for  the development and promulgation of standards by the commissioner,  including emergency temporary standards; and procedures for prompt  restraint or elimination of imminent danger situations by issuance of a  ``red-tag'' order effective for 3 days as well as by court injunction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The legislation is also intended to insure inspections in  response to complaints; give employer and employee representatives an  opportunity to accompany inspectors in order to aid inspections and that  loss of any privilege or payment to an employee as a result of aiding  such inspection would constitute discrimination; notification of  employees or their representatives where no compliance action is taken  as a result of alleged violations, including informal review;  notification of employees of their protections and obligations;  protection of employees against discharge or discrimination in terms and  conditions of employment by filing complaints with the commissioner and  hearings by the review commission; adequate safeguards to protect trade  secrets; provision for prompt notice to employers and employees of  alleged violations of standards and abatement requirements through the  issuance and posting of citations; a system of sanctions against  employers for violation of standards; employer right of review and  employee participation in review proceedings, before an independent  review commission; and coverage of employees of the State and political  subdivisions in the same manner as private employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Included in the plan is a statement of the Governor's support  for the legislation and a statement of legal opinion that it will meet  the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and  is consistent with the constitution and laws of Minnesota. The plan sets  out goals and provides a timetable for bringing it into full conformity  with part 1902 at the end of 3 years after commencement of operations  under the plan. Personnel will be employed under the existing State  merit system and the voluntary compliance program for onsite  consultation for private and public employers meets the conditions set  forth in the issues discussed in the Washington decision (38 FR 2421,  January 26, 1973).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The plan includes the following documents as of the date of  approval:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plan document and appendices;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Revised legislation, submitted January 25, 1973;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compliance manual and supplements to the plan document, February  15, 1973;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Letters from the Department of Labor and Industry dated February  8, 1973, and April 9, 1973.  [38 FR 15077, June 8, 1973, as amended at 50 FR 30831, July 30, 1985]</p>
