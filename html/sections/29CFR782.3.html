                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A ``driver,'' as defined for Motor Carrier Act jurisdiction (49  CFR parts 390-395; Ex parte No. MC-2, 3 M.C.C. 665; Ex parte No. MC-3,  23 M.C.C.1; Ex parte No. MC-4, 1 M.C.C. 1), is an individual who drives  a motor vehicle in transporation which is, within the meaning of the  Motor Carrier Act, in interstate or foreign commerce. (As to what is  considered transportation in interstate or foreign commerce within the  meaning of the Motor Carrier Act, see Sec. 782.7). This definition does  not require that the individual be engaged in such work at all times; it  is recognized that even full-duty drivers devote some of their working  time to activities other than such driving. ``Drivers,'' as thus  officially defined, include, for example, such partial-duty drivers as  the following, who drive in interstate or foreign commerce as part of a  job in which they are required also to engage in other types of driving  or nondriving work: Individuals whose driving duties are concerned with  transportation some of which is in intrastate commerce and some of which  is in interstate or foreign commerce within the meaning of the Motor  Carrier Act; individuals who ride on motor vehicles engaged in  transportation in interstate or foreign commerce and act as assistant or  relief drivers of the vehicles in addition to helping with loading,  unloading, and similar work; drivers of chartered buses or of farm  trucks who have many duties unrelated to driving or safety of operation  of their vehicles in interstate transportation on the highways; and so- called ``driver-salesmen'' who devote much of their time to selling  goods rather than to activities affecting such safety of operation.  (Levinson v. Spector Motor Service, 300 U.S. 649; Morris v. McComb, 332  U.S. 422; Richardson v. James Gibbons Co., 132 F. (2d) 627 (C.A. 4),  affirmed 319 U.S. 44; Gavril v. Kraft Cheese Co., 42 F. Supp. 702 (N.D.  Ill.); Walling v. Craig, 53 F. Supp. 479 (D. Minn.); Vannoy v. Swift &  Co. (Mo. S. Ct.), 201 S.W. (2d) 350; Ex parte No. MC-2, 3 M.C.C. 665; Ex  parte No. MC-3, 23 M.C.C. 1; Ex parte Nos. MC-2 and MC-3, 28 M.C.C. 125;  Ex parte No. MC-4, 1 M.C.C. 1. Cf. Colbeck v. Dairyland Creamery Co.  (S.D. Supp. Ct.), 17 N.W. (2d) 262, in which the court held that the  exemption did not apply to a refrigeration mechanic by reason solely of  the fact that he crossed State lines in a truck in which he transported  himself to and from the various places at which he serviced equipment  belonging to his employer.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em>. (Southland Gasoline  Co. v. Bayley, 319 U.S. 44; Levinson v. Spector Motor Service, 330 U.S.  649; Morris v. McComb, 332 U.S. 422; Rogers Cartage Co. v. Reynolds, 166  F. (2d) 317 (C.A. 6). This does not mean that an employee of a carrier  who drives a motor vehicle is exempted as a ``driver'' by virtue of that  fact alone. He is not exempt if his job never involves transportation in  interstate or foreign commerce within the meaning of the Motor Carrier  Act (see Sec. Sec. 782.2 (d) and (e), 782.7, and 782.8, or if he is  employed by a private carrier and the only such transportation called  for by his job is not transportation of property. (See Sec. 782.2. See  also Ex parte No. MC-28, 13 M.C.C. 481, Cf. Colbeck v. Dairyland  Creamery Co. (S. Ct. S.D.), 17 N.W. (2d) 262 (driver of truck used only  to transport himself to jobsites, as an incident of his work in  servicing his employer's refrigeration equipment, held non exempt).) It  has been held that so-called ``hostlers'' who ``spot'' trucks and  trailers at a terminal dock for loading and unloading are not exempt as  drivers merely because as an incident of such duties they drive the  trucks and tractors in and about the premises of the trucking terminal.
