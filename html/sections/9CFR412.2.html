If the Agency finds that  an establishment is using a false or misleading label, it will institute  the proceedings prescribed in Sec. 500.8 of this chapter to revoke the  approval for the label.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generically approved labels are labels that bear all applicable  mandatory labeling features (i.e., product name, safe handling  statement, ingredients statement, the name and place of business of the  manufacturer, packer or distributor, net weight, legend, safe handling  instructions, and nutrition labeling) in accordance with Federal  regulations. Labels that bear claims and statements that are defined in  FSIS's regulations or the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book  (except for natural and negative claims), such as a statement that  characterizes a product's nutrient content, such as ``low fat,'' has  geographical significance, such as ``German Brand,'' or makes a country  of origin statement on the label of any meat or poultry product  ``covered commodity'',\1\ and that comply with those regulations are  also deemed to be generically approved by the Agency without being  submitted for evaluation and approval. Allergen statements (e.g.,  ``contains soy'') applied in accordance with the Food Allergen Labeling  and Consumer Protection Act are also deemed generically approved. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ See 9 CFR 317.8(b)(40) and 381.129(f). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
