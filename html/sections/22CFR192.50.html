                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (5 U.S.C. 8101 et  seq.) provides for medical coverage and the payment of compensation for  wage loss and for permanent impairment of specified members and  functions of the body incurred by employees as a result of an injury  sustained while in the performance of their duties to the United States.  The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), Department of  Labor, administers the program. All individuals employed by the U.S.  Government as defined by 5 U.S.C. 8101</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> are eligible to apply for  wage-loss and medical benefits under the FECA. Family members of such  employees may apply for death benefits. An application must be made with  OWCP by such individual or on behalf of such individuals, prior to the  determination of eligibility or payment of any benefits under this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of foreign service national employees covered for  work related injury or death under the local compensation plan  established pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 3968, such applications should be  filed with the organizational authority in the country of employment  which provides such coverage. Benefit levels payable to foreign service  national employees under this subpart shall be no less than comparable  benefits payable to U.S. citizen employees under FECA. Eligibility  determination and payment of supplemental benefits, if any, is the  responsibility of the Director General of the Foreign Service for the  State Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>  of subpart B is excluded from the offset requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compensation under this section may include payment (whether  advancement or reimbursement) for any medical or health expenses  relating to the death or disability involved to the extent that such  expenses are not covered under subpart D of these regulations.  Procedures of subpart D of these regulations shall apply in making such  determinations.</p>
