A minimum of 40 plant samples must be tested per  nursery location. Samples must be taken from all symptomatic plants if  symptomatic plants are present. If fewer than 40 symptomatic plants are  present, each symptomatic plant must be sampled and the remainder of the  40 sample minimum must be taken from asymptomatic plants. If no  symptomatic plants are present, 40 asymptomatic plants must be sampled;  biased toward proven hosts.

If all plant samples tested in accordance  with this section and Sec. 301.92-12 return negative results for  Phytophthora ramorum, an inspector may certify that the nursery is free  of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum infestation at the time of  inspection, and the nursery will be eligible to enter into a compliance  agreement in accordance with Sec. 301.92-6. \18\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\18\ See footnote 14 of this subpart. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pre-shipment inspection, sampling, and testing--(i) Inspection.

The nursery must be visually inspected  annually for symptoms of Phytophthora ramorum. Inspections and  determinations of freedom from evidence of Phytophthora ramorum  infestation must occur at the time when the best expression of symptoms  is anticipated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sampling. All plants showing symptoms of infection with  Phytophthora ramorum upon inspection will be sampled and tested in  accordance with Sec. 301.92-12. If symptomatic plants are found upon  inspection, the following plants must be withheld from interstate  shipment until testing is completed and the nursery is found free of  evidence of Phytophthora ramorum in accordance with this paragraph  (b)(3) of this section and Sec. 301.92-12: All symptomatic plants, any  plants located in the same lot as the suspect plant, and any plants  located within 2 meters of this lot of plants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certification.

Samples must be taken from all symptomatic plants. If  fewer than 40 symptomatic plants are present, each symptomatic plant  must be sampled and additional samples must be taken from asymptomatic  plants so that the minimum number of plants sampled is 40. If no  symptomatic plants are present, 40 asymptomatic plants must be sampled.  Each sample may contain more than one leaf, and may come from more than  one plant, but all plants in the sample must be from the same lot. If  samples are collected from asymptomatic plants, the samples must be  taken from regulated and associated articles and nearby plants.

Inspections and  determinations of apparent pest freedom for such nurseries must occur at  the time when the best expression of symptoms is anticipated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sampling. All plants showing symptoms infection with  Phytophthora ramorum upon inspection will be sampled and tested in  accordance with Sec. 301.92-12. If symptomatic plants are found upon  inspection, the following plants must be withheld from interstate  shipment until testing is completed and the nursery is found free of  evidence of Phytophthora ramorum in accordance with Sec. 301.92-12: All  symptomatic plants, any plants located in the same lot as the  symptomatic plant, and any plants located within 2 meters of that lot of  plants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certification.

In  the event that APHIS informs a nursery owner that additional proven  hosts or associated plants exist, but those taxa are not yet listed in  this subpart, the following provisions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Nurseries operating under a compliance agreement in accordance  with Sec. 301.92-6 may continue to ship plants interstate in accordance  with this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nurseries that had not previously contained any regulated or  associated articles, and that had been inspected in accordance with  Sec. 301.92-11(b)(3) and allowed to ship plants interstate without  certificate, but that contain a newly identified proven host or  associated plant must cease interstate shipments of regulated articles  and associated hosts until the nursery is reinspected and found free of  evidence of Phytophthora ramorum in accordance with Sec. 301.92-11.  Nurseries that come under regulation during winter dormancy periods and  that are not able to be inspected in accordance with Sec. 301.92-11  prior to desired shipments of non-host nursery stock may be allowed to  ship non-host nursery stock interstate at the discretion of an  inspector.
