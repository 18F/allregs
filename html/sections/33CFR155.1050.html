This continuing evaluation is part of the Coast Guard's long term commitment to achieving and maintaining an optimum mix of oil spill response capability across the full spectrum of response modes. As best available technology demonstrates a need to evaluate or change mechanical recovery capacities, a review of cap increases and other requirements contained within this subpart may be performed. Any changes in the requirements of this section will occur through a public notice and comment process. During this review, the Coast Guard will determine if established caps remain practicable and if increased caps will provide any benefit to oil spill recovery operations. The review will include and evaluation of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Best available technologies for containment and recovery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Oil spill tracking technology;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> High rate response techniques;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other applicable response technologies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Increases in the availability of private response resources.
