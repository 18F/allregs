                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The burden of proof in the hearing convened pursuant to Sec.  164.131 shall be on the applicant and he shall proceed first. The issues  in the hearing shall be whether: (1) Substantial new evidence exists and  (2) such substantial new evidence requires reversal or modification of  the existing cancellation or suspension order. The determination of  these issues shall be made taking into account the human and  environmental risks found by the Administrator in his cancellation or  suspension determination and the cumulative effect of all past and  present uses, including the requested use, and uses which may reasonably  be anticipated to occur in the future as a result of granting the  requested reversal or modification. The granting of a particular  petition for use may not in itself pose a significant risk to man or the  environment, but the cumulative impact of each additional use of the  cancelled or suspended pesticide may re-establish, or serve to maintain,  the significant risks previously found by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The presiding officer shall make recommendations, including  findings of fact and conclusions and to the extent feasible, as  determined by the presiding officer, the procedures at the hearing shall  follow the Rules of Practice, set forth in subparts A and B of this part  164.</p>
