                                Sec. 536.129  Claims cognizable as UCMJ claims.

                            <p class="depth0">Claims cognizable under Article 139, UCMJ, are limited to the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement that conduct constructively violate UCMJ. In order to subject a person to liability under Article 139, the soldier's conduct must be such as would constitute a violation of one or more punitive Articles of the UCMJ. However, a referral of charges is not a prerequisite to action under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims for property willfully damaged. Willful damage is damage inflicted intentionally, knowingly, and purposefully without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from damage caused inadvertently, thoughtlessly or negligently. Damage, loss, or destruction of property caused by riotous, violent, or disorderly acts or acts of depredation, or through conduct showing reckless or wanton disregard of the property rights of others, may be considered willful damage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claims for property wrongfully taken. A wrongful taking is any unauthorized taking or withholding of property, with the intent to deprive, temporarily or permanently, the owner or person lawfully in possession of the property. Damage, loss, or destruction of property through larceny, forgery, embezzlement, fraud, misappropriation, or similar offense may be considered wrongful taking. However, mere breach of a fiduciary or contractual duty that does not involve larceny, forgery, embezzlement, fraud, or misappropriation does not constitute wrongful taking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definition of property. Article 139 provides compensation for loss of or damage to both personal property, whether tangible or intangible, and real property. Contrast this to the Personnel Claims Act and chapter 11 of AR 27-20, which provides compensation only for tangible personal property. Monetary losses may fall into the category of either tangible property (for example, cash), or intangible property (for example, an obligation incurred by a claimant to a third party as a result of fraudulent conduct by a soldier), although recovery for losses of intangible property may be limited by other provisions of this part, such as the exclusion of theft of services (see Sec. 536.130(f)) or consequential damages (see Sec. 536.130(g)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Claims cognizable under more than one statute. Claims cognizable under other claims statutes may be processed under this subpart.</p>
