In addition to the provisions of a particular purchase authorization, each purchase authorization, unless otherwise provided, is subject to the provisions of this part to the same extent as if the provisions were fully set forth in the purchase authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Modification or revocation. The General Sales Manager reserves the right at any time for any reason or cause whatsoever to supplement, modify or revoke any purchase authorization, including the termination of deliveries, if it is determined to be in the interest of the U.S. Government. CCC shall reimburse suppliers who would otherwise be entitled to be financed by CCC for costs which were incurred as a result of such action by the GSM in connection with firm sales or shipping contracts, and which were not otherwise recovered by the supplier after a reasonable effort to minimize such costs: Provided, however, That such reimbursement shall not be made to a supplier if the GSM determines that the GSM's action was taken because the supplier failed to comply with the requirements of the regulations in this

part or the applicable purchase authorization; Provided further, That reimbursement to suppliers of ocean transportation shall not exceed the ocean freight differential when the purchase authorization provides only for financing the differential.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Subauthorizations.
