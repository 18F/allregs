                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A State must agree to comply with this subpart, 2 CFR  part 200, the EPA general assistance regulations in 2 CFR part 1500 and  the specific conditions of the grant. A State must also agree to the  following requirements and, in some cases, provide   documentation as part of the capitalization grant application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Comply with State statutes and regulations. A State must agree  to comply with all State statutes and regulations that are applicable to  DWSRF program funds including capitalization grant funds, State match,  interest earnings, net bond proceeds, repayments, and funds used for  set-aside activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Demonstrate technical capability. A State must agree to provide  documentation demonstrating that it has adequate personnel and resources  to establish and manage the DWSRF program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Accept payments. A State must agree to accept capitalization  grant payments in accordance with a payment schedule negotiated between  EPA and the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Make binding commitments. A State must agree to enter into  binding commitments with assistance recipients to provide assistance  from the Fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Binding commitments must be made in an amount equal to the  amount of each capitalization grant payment and accompanying State match  that is deposited into the Fund and must be made within one year after  the receipt of each grant payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State may make binding commitments for more than the required  amount and credit the excess towards the binding commitment requirements  of subsequent grant payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a State is concerned about its ability to comply with the  binding commitment requirement, it must notify the RA and propose a  revised payment schedule for future grant payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Deposit of funds. A State must agree to promptly deposit DWSRF  program funds into appropriate accounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State must agree to deposit the portion of the capitalization  grant to be used for projects into the Fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State must agree to maintain separate and identifiable  accounts for the portion of the capitalization grant to be used for set- aside activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A State must agree to deposit net bond proceeds, interest  earnings, and repayments into the Fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A State must agree to deposit any fees, which include interest  earned on fees, into the Fund or into separate and identifiable  accounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Provide State match. A State must agree to deposit into the Fund  an amount from State monies that equals at least 20 percent of each  capitalization grant payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State must identify the source of State match in the  capitalization grant application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State must deposit the match into the Fund on or before the  date that a State receives each payment for the capitalization grant,  except when a State chooses to use a letter of credit (LOC) mechanism or  similar financial arrangement for the State match. Under this mechanism,  payments to this LOC account must be made proportionally on the same  schedule as the payments for the capitalization grant. Cash from this  State match LOC account must be drawn into the Fund as cash is drawn  into the Fund through the Automated Clearing House (ACH).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A State may issue general obligation or revenue bonds to derive  the State match. The net proceeds from the bonds issued by a State to  derive the match must be deposited into the Fund and the bonds may only  be retired using the interest portion of loan repayments and interest  earnings of the Fund. Loan principal must not be used to retire State  match bonds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the State deposited State monies in a dedicated revolving  fund after July 1, 1993, and prior to receiving a capitalization grant,  the State may credit these monies toward the match requirement if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The monies were deposited in a separate revolving fund that  subsequently became the Fund after receiving a capitalization grant and  they were expended in accordance with section 1452 of the Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The monies were deposited in a separate revolving fund that has  not received a capitalization grant, they were expended in accordance  with section 1452 of the Act, and an amount equal to all repayments of  principal and payments of interest from loans will be deposited into the  Fund; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The monies were deposited in a separate revolving fund and  used as a reserve for a leveraged program consistent with section 1452  of the Act and   an amount equal to the reserve is transferred to the Fund as the  reserve's function is satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a State provides a match in excess of the required amount,  the excess balance may be credited towards match requirements associated  with subsequent capitalization grants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Provide match for State program management set-aside. A State  must agree to provide a dollar for dollar match for expenditures made  under the State program management set-aside in accordance with  Sec. 35.3535(d)(2). This match is separate from the 20 percent State  match requirement for the capitalization grant in paragraph (g) of this  section and must be identified as an eligible credit, deposited into  set-aside accounts, or documented as in-kind services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Use generally accepted accounting principles. A State must agree  to ensure that the State and public water systems receiving assistance  will use accounting, audit, and fiscal procedures conforming to  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as promulgated by the  Governmental Accounting Standards Board or, in the case of privately- owned systems, the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The accounting  system used for the DWSRF program must allow for proper measurement of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Revenues earned and other receipts, including but not limited  to, loan repayments, capitalization grants, interest earnings, State  match deposits, and net bond proceeds;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Expenses incurred and other disbursements, including but not  limited to, loan disbursements, repayment of bonds, and other  expenditures allowed under section 1452 of the Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assets, liabilities, capital contributions, and retained  earnings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Conduct audits. In accordance with Sec. 35.3570(b), a State must  agree to comply with the provisions of the Single Audit Act Amendments  of 1996. A State may voluntarily agree to conduct annual independent  audits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Dedicated repayment source. A State must agree to adopt policies  and procedures to assure that assistance recipients have a dedicated  source of revenue for repayment of loans, or in the case of privately- owned systems, assure that recipients demonstrate that there is adequate  security to assure repayment of loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Efficient expenditure. A State must agree to commit and expend  all funds as efficiently as possible and in an expeditious and timely  manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Use funds in accordance with IUP. A State must agree to use all  funds in accordance with an IUP that was prepared after providing for  public review and comment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Biennial report. A State must agree to complete and submit a  Biennial Report that describes how it has met the goals and objectives  of the previous two fiscal years as stated in the IUPs and  capitalization grant agreements. The State must submit this report to  the RA according to the schedule established in the capitalization grant  agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Comply with cross-cutters. A State must agree to comply with all  applicable Federal cross-cutting authorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Comply with provisions to avoid withholdings. A State must agree  to demonstrate how it is complying with the requirements of capacity  development authority, capacity development strategy, and operator  certification program provisions in order to avoid withholdings of funds  under Sec. 35.3515(b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii).
