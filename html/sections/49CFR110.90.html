                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grant monitoring. Project managers are responsible for managing  the day-to-day operations of grant, subgrant and contract-supported  activities. Project managers must monitor performance of supported  activities to assure compliance with applicable Federal requirements and  achievement of performance goals. Monitoring must cover each program,  function, activity, or task covered by the grant. Monitoring and  reporting requirements for planning and training are contained in this  part; general grant reporting requirements are specified in 49 CFR  18.40.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reports. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The project manager shall submit a performance  report at the completion of an activity for which reimbursement is being  requested or with a request to amend the grant. The final performance  report is due 90 days after the expiration or termination of the grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Project managers shall submit an original and two copies of all  performance reports. Performance reports for planning and training must  include comparison of actual accomplishments to the stated goals and  objectives established for the performance period, and the reasons for  not achieving those goals and objectives, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Project managers shall report developments or events that occur  between the required performance reporting dates which have significant  impact upon the planning and training activity such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will impair the  ability to meet the objective of the grant; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and  objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more  beneficial results than originally planned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Financial reporting, except as provided in Sec. 110.70 and 49  CFR 18.41, shall be supplied quarterly using Standard Form 270, Request  for Advance or Reimbursement, to report the status of funds. The project  manager shall report separately on planning and training.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Records retention. In accordance with 49 CFR 18.42, all  financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical  records, training materials, and other documents generated under a grant  shall be maintained by the project manager for three years from the date  the project manager submits the final financial status report (SF 269)  or Request for Advance or Reimbursement (SF 270). The project manager  shall designate a repository and single-point of contact for planning  and for training, or both, for these purposes. If any litigation, claim,  negotiation, audit or other action involving the records has been  started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records must be  retained until completion of the action and resolution of all issues  which arise from it, or until the end of the regular 3-year period,  whichever is later.</p>
