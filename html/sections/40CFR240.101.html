Usually expressed in British thermal units per pound.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Hazardous waste means any waste or combination of wastes which pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or living organisms because such wastes are nondegradable or persistent in nature or because they can be biologically magnified, or because they can be lethal, or because they may otherwise cause or tend to cause detrimental cumulative effects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Incineration means the controlled process which combustible solid, liquid, or gaseous wastes are burned and changed into noncombustible gases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Incinerator means a facility consisting of one or more furnaces in which wastes are burned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Infectious waste means: (1) Equipment, instruments, utensils, and fomites of a disposable nature from the rooms of patients who are suspected to have or have been diagnosed as having a communicable disease and must, therefore, be isolated as required by public health agencies; (2) laboratory wastes such as pathological specimens (e.g., all tissues, specimens of blood elements, excreta, and secretions obtained from patients or laboratory animals) and disposable fomites (any substance that may harbor or trans mit pathogenic organisms) attendant thereto; (3) surgical operating room pathologic specimens and disposable fomites attendant thereto and similar disposable materials from outpatient areas and emergency rooms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Municipal solid wastes means normally, residential and commercial solid wastes generated within a community.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Open burning means burning of solid wastes in the open, such as in an open dump.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Open dump means a land disposal site at which solid wastes are disposed of in a manner that does not protect the environment, are susceptible to open burning, and are exposed to the elements, vectors, and scavengers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Plans means reports and drawings, including a narrative operating description, prepared to describe the facility and its proposed operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Residue means all the solids that remain after completion of thermal processing, including bottom ash, fly ash, and grate siftings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(v)</em> Responsible agency means the organizational element that has the legal duty to ensure that owners, operators, or users of facilities comply with these guidelines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(w)</em> Sanitary landfill means a land disposal site employing an engineered method of disposing of solid wastes on land in a manner that minimizes environmental hazards by spreading the solid wastes in thin layers, compacting the solid wastes to the smallest practical volume, and applying and compacting cover material at the end of each operating day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(x)</em> Sludge means the accumulated semiliquid suspension of settled solids deposited from wastewaters or other fluids in tanks or basins. It does not include solids or dissolved material in domestic sewage or other significant pollutants in water resources, such as silt, dissolved or suspended solids in industrial wastewater effluents, dissolved materials in irrigation return flows or other common water pollutants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(y)</em> Solid wastes means garbage, refuse, sludges, and other discarded solid materials resulting from industrial and commercial operations and from community activities. It does not include solids or dissolved material in domestic sewage or other significant pollutants in water resources, such as silt, dissolved or suspended solids in industrial wastewater effluents, dissolved materials in irrigation return flows or other common water pollutants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(z)</em> Special wastes means nonhazardous solid wastes requiring handling other than that normally used for municipal solid waste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(aa)</em> Thermal processing means processing of waste material by means of heat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(bb)</em> Vector means a carrier, usually an arthropod, that is capable of transmitting a pathogen from one organism to another.</p>
