                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section provides the test procedures for measuring,  pursuant to EPCA, the energy use in kilowatt hours per 100 pounds of ice  (kWh/100 lb ice) and the condenser water use in gallons per 100 pounds  of ice (gal/100 lb ice) of automatic commercial ice makers with  capacities between 50 and 4,000 pounds of ice per 24 hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Testing and Calculations. Measure the energy use and the  condenser water use of each covered product by conducting the test  procedures set forth in AHRI 810, section 3, ``Definitions,'' section 4,  ``Test Requirements,'' and section 5, ``Rating Requirements''  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.133). Where AHRI 810  references ``ASHRAE Standard 29,'' ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2009  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.133) shall be used. All  references to cube type ice makers in AHRI 810 apply to all batch type  automatic commercial ice makers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For batch type automatic commercial ice makers, the energy use  and condenser water use will be reported as measured in this paragraph  (b), including the energy and water consumption, as applicable, of the  ice-making mechanism, the compressor, and the condenser or condensing  unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For continuous type automatic commercial ice makers,  determine the energy use and condenser water use by multiplying the  energy consumption or condenser water use as measured in this paragraph  (b) by the ice hardness adjustment factor, determined using the  following equation:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11JA12.048</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determine the ice hardness factor by following the procedure  specified in the ``Procedure for Determining Ice Quality'' in section  A.3 of normative annex A of ANSI/ASHRAE 29 (incorporated by reference,  see Sec. 431.133), except that the test shall be conducted at an  ambient air temperature of 70 [deg]F 1 [deg]F,  with an initial water temperature of 90 [deg]F 1  [deg]F, and weights shall be accurate to within 2  percent of the quantity measured. The ice hardness factor is equivalent  to the corrected net cooling effect per pound of ice, line 19 in ANSI/ ASHRAE 29 Table A1, where the calorimeter constant used in line 18 shall  be that determined in section A2 using seasoned, block ice.
