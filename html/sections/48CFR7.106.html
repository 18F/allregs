Proposals submitted in response to such requirements may include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proposals to provide the Government the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive future acquisitions, together with the cost to the Government, if any, of acquiring such technical data and the right to use such data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple sources of supply for competitive future acquisitions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In determining whether to apply paragraphs (a) and (b) above, planners shall consider the purposes for which the system is being acquired and the

technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the contracting officer shall consider them in evaluating competing offers. In noncompetitive awards, the factors in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, may be considered by the contracting officer as objectives in negotiating the contract.
