                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Well-control fluids, equipment, and operations shall be designed, utilized, maintained, and/or tested as necessary to control the well in foreseeable conditions and circumstances, including subfreezing conditions. The well shall be continuously monitored during well-completion operations and shall not be left unattended at any time unless the well is shut in and secured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following well-control-fluid equipment shall be installed, maintained, and utilized:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A fill-up line above the uppermost BOP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A well-control, fluid-volume measuring device for determining fluid volumes when filling the hole on trips; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A recording mud-pit-level indicator to determine mud-pit-volume gains and losses. This indicator shall include both a visual and an audible warning device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When coming out of the hole with drill pipe, the annulus shall be filled with well-control fluid before the change in such fluid level decreases the hydrostatic pressure 75 pounds per square inch (psi) or every five stands of drill pipe, whichever gives a lower decrease in hydrostatic pressure. The number of stands of drill pipe and drill collars that may be pulled prior to filling the hole and the equivalent well-control fluid volume shall be calculated and posted near the operator's station. A mechanical, volumetric, or electronic device for measuring the amount of well-control fluid required to fill the hole shall be utilized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Before you displace kill-weight fluid from the wellbore and/or riser to an underbalanced state, you must obtain approval from the BSEE District Manager. To obtain approval, you must submit with your APM your reasons for displacing the kill-weight fluid and provide detailed step-by-step written procedures describing how you will safely displace these fluids. The step-by-step displacement procedures must address the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Number and type of independent barriers, as described in Sec.  250.420(b)(3), that are in place for each flow path that requires such barriers,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tests you will conduct to ensure integrity of independent barriers,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> BOP procedures you will use while displacing kill-weight fluids, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Procedures you will use to monitor the volumes and rates of fluids entering and leaving the wellbore.
