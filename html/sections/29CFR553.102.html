                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 3(e)(4)(A)(ii) of the FLSA does not permit an individual  to perform hours of volunteer service for a public agency when such  hours involve the same type of services which the individual is employed  to perform for the same public agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Whether two agencies of the same State or local government  constitute the same public agency can only be determined on a case-by- case basis. One factor that would support a conclusion that two agencies  are separate is whether they are treated separately for statistical  purposes in the Census of Governments issued by the Bureau of the  Census, U.S. Department of Commerce.    Sec. 553.103  ``Same type of services'' defined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The 1985 Amendments provide that employees may volunteer hours  of service to their public employer or agency provided ``such services  are not the same type of services which the individual is employed to  perform for such public agency.'' Employees may volunteer their services  in one capacity or another without contemplation of pay for services  rendered. The phrase ``same type of services'' means similar or  identical services. In general, the Administrator will consider, but not  as the only criteria, the duties and other factors contained in the  definitions of the 3-digit categories of occupations in the Dictionary  of Occupational Titles in determining whether the volunteer activities  constitute the ``same type of services'' as the employment activities.  Equally important in such a determination will be the consideration of  all the facts and circumstances in a particular case, including whether  the volunteer service is closely related to the actual duties performed  by or responsibilities assigned to the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An example of an individual performing services which constitute  the ``same type of services'' is a nurse employed by a State hospital  who proposes to volunteer to perform nursing services at a State- operated health clinic which does not qualify as a separate public  agency as discussed in   Sec. 553.102. Similarly, a firefighter cannot volunteer as a  firefighter for the same public agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples of volunteer services which do not constitute the  ``same type of services'' include: A city police officer who volunteers  as a part-time referee in a basketball league sponsored by the city; an  employee of the city parks department who serves as a volunteer city  firefighter; and an office employee of a city hospital or other health  care institution who volunteers to spend time with a disabled or elderly  person in the same institution during off duty hours as an act of  charity.</p>
