An order assessing a civil penalty for a violation under 49 U.S.C. chapter 51, or a rule, regulation, or order issued thereunder, is issued only after the following factors have been considered:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior violations, the ability to pay, and any effect on the ability to continue to do business; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Such other matters as justice may require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Order assessing civil penalty.

A final notice of proposed civil penalty may be issued after participation in informal procedures provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section or failure to respond in a timely manner to a notice of proposed civil penalty. A final notice of proposed civil penalty will be sent to the individual charged with a violation, to the president of the corporation or company charged with a violation, or a person previously designated in writing by the individual, corporation, or company to receive documents in that civil penalty action.

A person requesting a hearing shall file a written request for a hearing with the hearing docket clerk, using the appropriate address set forth in Sec. 13.210(a) of

this part, and shall mail a copy of the request to the agency attorney. The request for a hearing may be in the form of a letter but must be dated and signed by the person requesting a hearing. The request for a hearing may be typewritten or may be legibly handwritten.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Hearing. If the person charged with a violation requests a hearing pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) or paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the original complaint shall be filed with the hearing docket clerk and a copy shall be sent to the person requesting the hearing. The procedural rules in subpart G of this part apply to the hearing and any appeal.

Judicial review is in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the party resides or has the party's principal place of business as provided in Sec. 13.235 of this part.
