(1) In accordance with section 563 of Public Law 110-417, DSAID shall support Military Service SAPR program management and DoD SAPRO oversight activities. It shall serve as a centralized, case-level database for the collection and maintenance of information regarding sexual assaults involving persons covered by this part. DSAID will include information, if available, about the nature of the assault, the victim, services offered to the victim, the offender, and the disposition of the reports associated with the assault. DSAID will serve as the DoD's SAPR source for internal and external requests for statistical data on sexual assault in accordance with section 563 of Public Law 110-417. The DSAID has been assigned OMB Control Number 0704-0482. DSAID contains information provided by the military services, which are the original source of the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In accordance with section 563 of Public Law 110-417, DSAID shall support Military Service SAPR program management and DoD SAPRO oversight activities.
