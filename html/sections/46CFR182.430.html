                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The design of all exhaust systems must ensure minimum risk of  injury to personnel. Protection must be provided in compliance with  Sec. 177.970 of this chapter at such locations where persons or  equipment might come in contact with an exhaust pipe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exhaust gas must not leak from the piping or any connections.  The piping must be properly supported by noncombustible hangers or  blocks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The exhaust piping must be so arranged as to prevent backflow of  water from reaching engine exhaust ports under normal conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pipes used for wet exhaust lines must be Schedule 80 or  corrosion-resistant material and adequately protected from mechanical  damage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where flexibility is necessary, a section of flexible metallic  hose may be used. Nonmetallic hose may be used for wet exhaust systems  provided it is especially adapted to resist the action of oil, acid, and  heat, has a wall thickness sufficient to prevent collapsing or panting,  and is double clamped where practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where an exhaust pipe passes through a watertight bulkhead, the  watertight integrity of the bulkhead must be maintained. Noncombustible  packing must be used in bulkhead penetration glands for dry exhaust  systems. A wet exhaust pipe may be welded to a steel or equivalent  bulkhead in way of a penetration and a fiberglass wet exhaust pipe may  be fiberglassed to a fiberglass reinforced plastic bulkhead if suitable  arrangements are provided to relieve the stresses resulting from the  expansion of the exhaust piping.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A dry exhaust pipe must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If it passes through a combustible bulkhead or partition, be  kept clear of, and suitably insulated or shielded from, combustible  material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be provided with noncombustible hangers and blocks for support.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> An exhaust pipe discharge terminating in a transom must be  located as far outboard as practicable so that exhaust gases cannot  reenter the vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Arrangements must be made to provide access to allow complete  inspection of the exhaust piping throughout its length.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> An exhaust installation subject to pressures in excess of 105  kPa (15 psig) gauge or having exhaust pipes passing through living or  working spaces must meet the material requirements of part 56 of  subchapter F (Marine Engineering) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Engine exhaust pipe installations built in accordance with the  requirements of ABYC P-1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR  175.600), will be considered as meeting the requirements of this  section.
