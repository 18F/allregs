This section does not apply to actual duty loss tenders determined by CBP pursuant to Sec. 162.74(c) of this Chapter relating to prior disclosure and to actual duty loss demands made under Sec. 162.79b of this Chapter. The request for advice may be initiated by the alleged violator or any CBP officer, but must be submitted to the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer retains the authority to refuse to forward any request that fails to raise a qualifying issue and to seek legal advice from the appropriate Associate or Assistant Chief Counsel in any case.</p>
