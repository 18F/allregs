No ratification, however, shall be valid unless the tribe has a constitution adopted and approved pursuant to the relevant Federal Statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Secretary shall authorize the calling of an election on the adoption of amendments to a constitution and bylaws or a charter when requested pursuant to the amendment article of those documents. The election shall be conducted as prescribed in this part unless the amendment article of the constitution and bylaws or the charter provides otherwise, in which case the provisions of those documents shall rule where applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the amendment provisions of a tribal constitution or charter have become outdated and amendment can not be effected pursuant to them, the Secretary may authorize an election under this part to amend the documents when the recognized tribal government so requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any authorization not acted upon within 90 days (tribes in Alaska shall be granted 120 days) from the date of issuance will be considered void. Notification of the election date as provided for in Sec. 81.14 shall constitute the action envisioned in this section. Extension of an authorization may be granted upon a valid and reasonable request from the election board. Copies of authorizations shall be furnished the requesting tribe or petitioners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In those instances where conflicting proposals to amend a single constitutional or charter provision are submitted, that proposal first received by the officer in charge, if found valid, shall be placed before the voters before any consideration is given other proposals. Other proposals shall be considered in order of their receipt; provided, they are resubmitted following final action on the initial submission. This procedure shall also apply in those instances where new or revised constitutions are at issue.</p>
