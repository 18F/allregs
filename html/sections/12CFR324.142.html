                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Hierarchy of approaches. Except as provided elsewhere in this section and in Sec. 324.141:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from a securitization and must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the portion of any CEIO that does not constitute after tax gain-on-sale;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the FDIC-supervised institution must apply the supervisory formula approach in Sec. 324.143 to the exposure if the FDIC-supervised institution and the exposure qualify for the supervisory formula approach according to Sec. 324.143(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and does not qualify for the supervisory formula approach, the FDIC-supervised institution may apply the simplified supervisory formula approach under Sec. 324.144;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, does not qualify for the supervisory formula approach in Sec. 324.143, and the FDIC-supervised institution does not apply the simplified supervisory formula approach in Sec. 324.144, the FDIC-supervised institution must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the exposure; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If a securitization exposure is a derivative contract (other than protection provided by an FDIC-supervised institution in the form of a credit derivative) that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments), an FDIC-supervised institution may choose to set the risk-weighted asset amount of the exposure equal to the amount of the exposure as determined in paragraph (e) of this section rather than apply the hierarchy of approaches described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures. An FDIC-supervised institution's total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures is equal to the sum of its risk-weighted assets calculated using Sec. Sec. 324.141 through 146.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Deductions. An FDIC-supervised institution may calculate any deduction from common equity tier 1 capital for a securitization exposure net of any DTLs associated with the securitization exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Maximum risk-based capital requirement. Except as provided in Sec. 324.141(c), unless one or more underlying exposures does not meet the definition of a wholesale, retail, securitization, or equity exposure, the total risk-based capital requirement for all securitization exposures held by a single FDIC-supervised institution associated with a single securitization (excluding any risk-based capital requirements that relate to the FDIC-supervised institution's gain-on-sale or CEIOs associated with the securitization) may not exceed the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The FDIC-supervised institution's total risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures calculated under this subpart as if the FDIC-supervised institution directly held the underlying exposures; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total ECL of the underlying exposures calculated under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Exposure amount of a securitization exposure. (1) The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, OTC derivative contract, or cleared transaction is the FDIC-supervised institution's carrying value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, OTC derivative contract, or cleared transaction is the FDIC-supervised institution's carrying value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (m) of this section, the exposure amount of an off-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not an OTC derivative contract (other than a credit derivative), repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative) is the notional amount of the exposure. For an off-balance-sheet securitization exposure to an ABCP program, such as an eligible ABCP liquidity facility, the notional amount may be reduced to the maximum potential amount that the FDIC-supervised institution could be required to fund given the ABCP program's current underlying assets (calculated without regard to the current credit quality of those assets).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The exposure amount of a securitization exposure that is a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or OTC derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) or cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative)

is the EAD of the exposure as calculated in Sec. 324.132 orSec. 324.133.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Overlapping exposures. If an FDIC-supervised institution has multiple securitization exposures that provide duplicative coverage of the underlying exposures of a securitization (such as when an FDIC-supervised institution provides a program-wide credit enhancement and multiple pool-specific liquidity facilities to an ABCP program), the FDIC-supervised institution is not required to hold duplicative risk-based capital against the overlapping position. Instead, the FDIC-supervised institution may assign to the overlapping securitization exposure the applicable risk-based capital treatment under this subpart that results in the highest risk-based capital requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Securitizations of non-IRB exposures. Except as provided in Sec. 324.141(c), if an FDIC-supervised institution has a securitization exposure where any underlying exposure is not a wholesale exposure, retail exposure, securitization exposure, or equity exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization and apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the portion of any CEIO that does not constitute gain-on-sale, if the FDIC-supervised institution is an originating FDIC-supervised institution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> May apply the simplified supervisory formula approach in Sec. 324.144 to the exposure, if the securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (g)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the exposure if the securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, does not qualify for the supervisory formula approach in Sec. 324.143, and the FDIC-supervised institution does not apply the simplified supervisory formula approach in Sec. 324.144 to the exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Implicit support. If an FDIC-supervised institution provides support to a securitization in excess of the FDIC-supervised institution's contractual obligation to provide credit support to the securitization (implicit support):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The FDIC-supervised institution must calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for underlying exposures associated with the securitization as if the exposures had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The FDIC-supervised institution must disclose publicly:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That it has provided implicit support to the securitization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The regulatory capital impact to the FDIC-supervised institution of providing such implicit support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Undrawn portion of a servicer cash advance facility. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, an FDIC-supervised institution that is a servicer under an eligible servicer cash advance facility is not required to hold risk-based capital against potential future cash advance payments that it may be required to provide under the contract governing the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, an FDIC-supervised institution that is a servicer under an eligible servicer cash advance facility is not required to hold risk-based capital against potential future cash advance payments that it may be required to provide under the contract governing the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For an FDIC-supervised institution that acts as a servicer, the exposure amount for a servicer cash advance facility that is not an eligible servicer cash advance facility is equal to the amount of all potential future cash advance payments that the FDIC-supervised institution may be contractually required to provide during the subsequent 12 month period under the contract governing the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Interest-only mortgage-backed securities. Regardless of any other provisions in this part, the risk weight for a non-credit-enhancing interest-only mortgage-backed security may not be less than 100 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Small-business loans and leases on personal property transferred with recourse. (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart E, an FDIC-supervised institution that has transferred small-business loans and leases on personal property (small-business obligations) with recourse must include in risk-weighted assets only the contractual amount of retained recourse if all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart E, an FDIC-supervised institution that has transferred small-business loans and leases on personal property (small-business obligations) with recourse must include in risk-weighted assets only the contractual amount of retained recourse if all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transaction is a sale under GAAP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The FDIC-supervised institution establishes and maintains, pursuant to GAAP, a non-capital reserve sufficient

to meet the FDIC-supervised institution's reasonably estimated liability under the recourse arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The loans and leases are to businesses that meet the criteria for a small-business concern established by the Small Business Administration under section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632 et seq.); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The FDIC-supervised institution is well-capitalized, as defined in subpart H of this part. For purposes of determining whether an FDIC-supervised institution is well capitalized for purposes of this paragraph (k), the FDIC-supervised institution's capital ratios must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations with recourse specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total outstanding amount of recourse retained by an FDIC-supervised institution on transfers of small-business obligations subject to paragraph (k)(1) of this section cannot exceed 15 percent of the FDIC-supervised institution's total capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If an FDIC-supervised institution ceases to be well capitalized or exceeds the 15 percent capital limitation in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the preferential capital treatment specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section will continue to apply to any transfers of small-business obligations with recourse that occurred during the time that the FDIC-supervised institution was well capitalized and did not exceed the capital limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The risk-based capital ratios of an FDIC-supervised institution must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations with recourse specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Nth-to-default credit derivatives-- (1) Protection provider.

In the case of credit protection sold, an FDIC-supervised institution must determine its exposure in the nth-to-default credit derivative as the largest notional amount of all the underlying exposures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of determining the risk weight for an nth-to-default credit derivative using the SFA or the SSFA, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the attachment point and detachment point of its exposure as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The attachment point (parameter A) is the ratio of the sum of the notional amounts of all underlying exposures that are subordinated to the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. For purposes of the SSFA, parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. For purposes of using the SFA to calculate the risk weight for its exposure in an nth-to-default credit derivative, parameter A must be set equal to the credit enhancement level (L) input to the SFA formula. In the case of a first-to-default credit derivative, there are no underlying exposures that are subordinated to the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure.

For purposes of the SSFA, parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. For purposes of the SFA, parameter D must be set to equal L plus the thickness of tranche T input to the SFA formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution that does not use the SFA or the SSFA to determine a risk weight for its exposure in an nth-to-default credit derivative must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Protection purchaser--(i) First-to-default credit derivatives.
