A futures commission merchant shall be deemed to be in compliance with the recordkeeping requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(1)(iv) of this section with respect to a Material Affiliated Person if such futures commission merchant maintains and makes available, or causes such Material Affiliated Person to make available, for inspection by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of this section copies of any financial or risk exposure reports filed by such Material Affiliated Person with a foreign futures authority or other foreign regulatory authority, provided that: (1) the futures commission merchant agrees to use its best efforts to obtain from the Material Affiliated Person and to cause the Material Affiliated Person to provide, directly or through its foreign futures authority or other foreign regulatory authority, any supplemental information the Commission may request and there is no statute or other bar in the foreign jurisdiction that would preclude the futures commission merchant, the Material Affiliated Person, the foreign futures authority or other foreign regulatory authority from providing such information to the Commission; or (2) the foreign futures authority or other foreign regulatory authority with whom the Material Affiliated Person files such reports has entered into an information-sharing agreement with the Commission which is in effect as of the futures commission merchant's fiscal year-end and which will allow the Commission to obtain the type of information required herein. The futures commission merchant shall maintain a copy of the original report and a copy translated into the English language. For the purposes of this section, the term ``Foreign Futures Authority'' shall have the

meaning set forth in section 1a(10) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exemptions. (1) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any futures commission merchant which holds funds or property of or for futures customers of less than $6,250,000 and has less than $5,000,000 in adjusted net capital as of the futures commission merchant's current fiscal year-end; provided, however, that such futures commission merchant is not a clearing member of an exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Commission may, upon written application by a Reporting Futures Commission Merchant, exempt from the provisions of this section, other than paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, any futures commission merchant affiliated with such Reporting Futures Commission Merchant. The term ``Reporting Futures Commission Merchant'' shall mean, in the case of a futures commission merchant that is affiliated with another registered futures commission merchant, the futures commission merchant which maintains the greater amount of adjusted net capital as last reported on financial reports filed with the Commission pursuant to Sec. 1.10 unless another futures commission merchant is acting as the Reporting Broker or Dealer under Sec. 240.17h-2T of this title, or the Commission permits another futures commission merchant to act as the Reporting Futures Commission Merchant. In granting exemptions under this section, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, whether the records required by this section concerning the Material Affiliated Persons of the futures commission merchant affiliated with the Reporting Futures Commission Merchant will be available to the Commission pursuant to this section or Sec. 1.15. A request for exemption filed under this paragraph (d)(2) shall explain the basis for the designation of a particular futures commission merchant as the Reporting Futures Commission Merchant and will become effective on the thirtieth day after receipt of such request by the Commission unless the Commission objects to the request by that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Commission may exempt any futures commission merchant from any provision of this section if it finds that the exemption is not contrary to the public interest and the purposes of the provisions from which the exemption is sought. The Commission may grant the exemption subject to such terms and conditions as it may find appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Location of records. A futures commission merchant required to maintain records concerning Material Affiliated Persons pursuant to this section may maintain those records either at the principal office of the Material Affiliated Person or at a records storage facility, provided that, except as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, the records are located within the boundaries of the United States and the records are kept and available for inspection in accordance with Sec. 1.31. If such records are maintained at a place other than the futures commission merchant's principal place of business, the Material Affiliated Person or other entity maintaining the records shall file with the Commission a written undertaking, in a form acceptable to the Commission, signed by a duly authorized person, to the effect that the records will be treated as if the futures commission merchant were maintaining the records pursuant to this section and that the entity maintaining the records will permit examination of such records at any time, or from time to time during business hours, by representatives or designees of the Commission and promptly furnish the Commission representative or its designee true, correct, complete and current hard copy of all or any part of such records. The election to maintain records at the principal place of business of the Material Affiliated Person or at a records storage facility pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall not relieve the futures commission merchant required to maintain and preserve such records from any of its responsibilities under this section or Sec. 1.15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Confidentiality. All information obtained by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of this section from a futures commission merchant concerning a Material Affiliated Person shall be

deemed confidential information for the purposes of section 8 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Implementation schedule.
