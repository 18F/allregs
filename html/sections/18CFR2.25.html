                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General Policy. This Statement of Policy is adopted in furtherance of the goals of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. 101-549, Title IV, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Costing Emissions Allowances in Coordination Sales. If a public utility's coordination rate on file with the Commission provides for recovery of variable costs on an incremental basis, the Commission will allow recovery of the incremental costs of emissions allowances associated with a coordination sale. If a coordination rate does not reflect incremental costs, the public utility should propose alternative allowance costing methods or demonstrate that the coordination rate does not produce unreasonable results. The Commission finds that the cost to replace an allowance is an appropriate basis to establish the incremental cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Use of Indices. The Commission will allow public utilities to determine emissions allowance costs on the basis of an index or combination of indices of the current price of emissions allowances, provided that the public utility affords purchasing utilities the option of providing emissions allowances. Public utilities should explain and justify any use of different incremental cost indices for pricing coordination sales and making dispatch decisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Calculation of Amount of Emissions Allowances Associated With Coordination Transactions. Public utilities should explain the methods used to compute the amount of emissions allowances included in coordination transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Timing. (1) Public utilities should provide information to purchasing utilities regarding the timing of opportunities for purchasers to stipulate whether they will purchase or return emissions allowances. A public utility may require a purchasing utility to declare, no later than the beginning of the coordination transaction:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether it will purchase or return emissions allowances; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If it will return emissions allowances, the date on which those allowances will be returned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Public utilities may include in agreements with purchasing utilities non-discriminatory provisions for indemnification if the purchasing utility fails to provide emissions allowances by the date on which it declares that the allowances will be returned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Other Costing Methods Not Precluded. The ratemaking treatment of emissions allowance costs endorsed in this Policy Statement does not preclude other approaches proposed by individual utilities on a case-by-case basis.
