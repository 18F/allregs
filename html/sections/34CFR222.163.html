Section 8009(d)(1)(B) provides that, upon certification by the Secretary, in allocating State aid a State may consider as local resources funds received under sections 8002 and 8003(b) (including hold harmless payments calculated under section 8003(e)) only in proportion to the share that local tax revenues covered under a State equalization program are of total local tax revenues. Determinations of proportionality must be made on a case-by-case basis for each LEA affected and not on the basis of a general rule to be applied throughout a State.

(1) In computing the share that local tax revenues covered under a State equalization program are of total local tax revenues for an LEA with respect to a program qualifying under Sec. 222.162, the proportion is obtained by dividing the amount of local tax revenues covered under the equalization program by the total local tax revenues attributable to current expenditures for free public education within that LEA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In computing the share that local tax revenues covered under a State equalization program are of total local tax revenues for an LEA with respect to a program qualifying under Sec. 222.162, the proportion is obtained by dividing the amount of local tax revenues covered under the equalization program by the total local tax revenues attributable to current expenditures for free public education within that LEA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases where there are no local tax revenues for current expenditures and the State provides all of those revenues on behalf of the LEA, the State may consider up to 100 percent of the funds received under the Act by that LEA in allocating State aid.

8003(e)) may be applied by a State to actual receipts of those payments.
