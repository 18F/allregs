                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All applications for financing of additional generation capacity and the associated bulk transmission facilities shall be supported by a power cost study to demonstrate that the proposed generation and associated transmission facilities are the most economical and effective means of meeting the borrower's power requirements. This study usually is a separate study but it may be integrated with the financial forecast required by Sec. 1710.302.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A power cost study shall include the following basic elements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A study of all reasonably available self-generation, purchased-power, load management, and energy conservation alternatives as set forth in Sec. Sec. 1710.253 and 1710.254;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A present-value analysis of the costs of the alternatives and their effects on total power costs, covering a period of at least 10 years beyond the projected in-service date of the facilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of proposed new power-purchase contracts or revisions to existing contracts, and an analysis of the effects on power costs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use of sensitivity analyses to determine the vulnerability of the alternatives to a reasonable range of assumptions about fuel costs, failure to achieve projected load growth, changes in operating and financing costs, and other major factors, if the financial forecast is used in support of a loan or loan guarantee that exceeds the smaller of $25 million or 10 percent of the borrower's total utility plant. Individual sensitivity analyses need not be duplicated if they have been included in other materials submitted to RUS; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Assessment of the financial risks of the various alternatives, especially as between capital-intensive and non-capital-intensive alternatives, under the range of assumptions set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Power cost studies must use current, RUS-approved power requirements data, and all major assumptions are subject to RUS approval. Alternative assumptions about projected power requirements may be used, however, in conjunction with the sensitivity analyses required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
