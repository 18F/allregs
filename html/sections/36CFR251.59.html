Except for easements issued under authorities other than Sec. 251.53(e) and leases and easements under Sec. 251.53(l) of this subpart, the new owner of the authorized improvements must apply for and receive a new special use authorization. The

new owner must meet requirements under applicable regulations of this subpart and agree to comply with the terms and conditions of the authorization and any new terms and conditions warranted by existing or prospective circumstances.
