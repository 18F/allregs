                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Amounts allocated on the basis of the business done  with or for a patron by a cooperative association, whether or not  entitled to tax treatment under section 522, in cash, merchandise,  capital stock, revolving fund certificates, retain certificates,  certificates of indebtedness, letters of advice or in some other manner  disclosing to the patron the dollar amount allocated, shall be included  in the computation of the gross income of such patron for the taxable  year in which received to the extent prescribed in paragraph (b) of this  section, regardless of whether the allocation is deemed, for the purpose  of section 522, to be made at the close of a preceding taxable year of  the cooperative association. The determination of the extent of  taxability of such amounts is in no way dependent upon the method of  accounting employed by the patron or upon the method, cash, accrual, or  otherwise, upon which the taxable income of such patron is computed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Extent of taxability. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Amounts allocated to a patron on a  patronage basis by a cooperative association with respect to products  marketed for such patron, or with respect to supplies, equipment, or  services, the cost of which was deductible by the patron under section  162 or section 212, shall be included in the computation of the gross  income of such patron, as ordinary income, to the following extent:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the allocation is in cash, the amount of cash received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the allocation is in merchandise, the amount of the fair  market value of such merchandise at the time of receipt by the patron.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the allocation is in the form of revolving fund  certificates, retain certificates, certificates of indebtedness, letters  of advice, or similar documents, the amount of the fair market value of  such document at the time of its receipt by the patron. For purposes of  this subdivision, any document containing an unconditional promise to  pay a fixed sum of money on demand or at a fixed or determinable time  shall be considered to have a fair market value at the time of its  receipt by the patron, unless it is clearly established to the contrary.  However, for purposes of this subdivision, any document which is payable  only in the discretion of the cooperative association, or which is  otherwise subject to conditions beyond the control of the patron, shall  be considered not to have any fair market value at the time of its  receipt by the patron, unless it is clearly established to the contrary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the allocation is in the form of capital stock, the amount  of the fair market value, if any, of such capital stock at the time of  its receipt by the patron.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If any allocation to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  applies is received in the form of a document of the type described in  subparagraph (1) (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph and is redeemed in full  or in part or is otherwise disposed of, there shall be included in the  computation of the gross income of the patron, as ordinary income, in  the year of redemption or   other disposition, the excess of the amount realized on the redemption  or other disposition over the amount previously included in the  computation of gross income under such subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amounts which are allocated on a patronage basis by a  cooperative association with respect to supplies, equipment, or  services, the cost of which was not deductible by the patron under  section 162 or section 212, are not includible in the computation of the  gross income of such patron. However, in the case of such amounts which  are allocated with respect to capital assets (as defined in section  1221) or property used in the trade or business within the meaning of  section 1231, such amounts shall, to the extent set forth in  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, be taken into account by such patron  in determining the cost of the property to which the allocation relates.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, to the extent that such amounts  are in excess of the unrecovered cost of such property, and to the  extent that such amounts relate to such property which the patron no  longer owns, they shall be included in the computation of the gross  income of such patron.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If any patronage dividend is allocated to the patron in the  form of a document of the type described in subparagraph (1) (iii) or  (iv) of this paragraph, and if such allocation is with respect to  capital assets (as defined in section 1221) or property used in the  trade or business within the meaning of section 1231, any amount  realized on the redemption or other disposition of such document which  is in excess of the amount which was taken into account upon the receipt  of the document by the patron shall be taken into account by such patron  in the year of redemption or other disposition as an adjustment to basis  or as an inclusion in the computation of gross income, as the case may  be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any adjustment to basis in respect of an amount to which  subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph applies shall be made as of  the first day of the taxable year in which such amount is received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The application of the provisions of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On July 1, 1959, P, a patron of a cooperative  association, purchases a tractor for use in his farming business from  such association for $2,200. The tractor has an estimated useful life of  five years and an estimated salvage value of $200. P files his income  tax returns on a calendar year basis and claims depreciation on the  tractor for the year 1959 of $200 pursuant to his use of the straight- line method at the rate of $400 per year. On July 1, 1960, the  cooperative association allocates to P with respect to his purchase of  the tractor a dividend of $300 in cash. P will reduce his depreciation  allowance with respect to the tractor for 1960 (and subsequent taxable  years) to $333.33, determined as follows:  Cost of tractor, July 1, 1959..................................   $2,200</p><p class="depth0">Less:</p><p class="depth0">Depreciation for 1959 (6 mos.)....................     $200</p><p class="depth0">Adjustment as of Jan. 1, 1960, for cash patronage       300</p><p class="depth0">dividend.........................................</p><p class="depth0">Salvage value.....................................      200</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">700</p><p class="depth0">--------</p><p class="depth0">Basis for depreciation for the remaining 4\1/2\ years of     1,500</p><p class="depth0">estimated life.......................................... Basis for depreciation divided by the 4\1/2\ years of remaining   333.33</p><p class="depth0">life..........................................................</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that on  July 1, 1960, the cooperative association allocates a dividend to P with  respect to his purchase of the tractor in the form of a revolving fund  certificate having a face amount of $300. The certificate is redeemable  in cash at the discretion of the directors of the association and is  subject to diminution by any future losses of the association, and has  no fair market value when received by P. Since the certificate had no  fair market value when received by P, no amount with respect to such  certificate was taken into account by him in the year 1960. In 1965, P  receives $300 cash from the association in full redemption of the  certificate. Prior to 1965, he had recovered through depreciation $2,000  of the cost of the tractor, leaving an unrecovered cost of $200 (the  salvage value). For the year 1965, the redemption proceeds of $300 are  applied against the unrecovered cost of $200, reducing the basis to  zero, and the balance of the redemption proceeds, $100, is includible in  the computation of P's gross income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that the  certificate is redeemed in full on July 1, 1962. The full $300 received  on redemption of the certificate will be applied against the unrecovered  cost of the tractor as of January 1, 1962, computed as follows:  Cost of tractor, July 1, 1959..................................   $2,200</p><p class="depth0">Less:</p><p class="depth0">Depreciation for 1959 (6 mos.)....................     $200</p><p class="depth0">Depreciation for 1960.............................      400</p><p class="depth0">Depreciation for 1961.............................      400</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">1,000</p><p class="depth0">--------</p><p class="depth0">Unrecovered cost on Jan. 1, 1962.........................    1,200 Adjustment as of Jan. 1, 1962, for proceeds of the redemption        300</p><p class="depth0">of the revolving fund certificate.............................</p><p class="depth0">---------- Unrecovered cost on Jan. 1, 1962, after adjustment.............      900</p><p class="depth0">Less: Salvage value........................................      200</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Basis for depreciation on Jan. 1, 1962...................      700 If P uses the tractor in his business until June 30,</p><p class="depth0">1964, he would be entitled to the following</p><p class="depth0">depreciation allowances with respect to the tractor:</p><p class="depth0">For 1962............................................      280</p><p class="depth0">For 1963............................................      280</p><p class="depth0">For 1964 (6 mos.)...................................      140</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">700</p><p class="depth0">-------- Balance to be depreciated......................................        0</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example (3), except that P  sells the tractor in 1961. The entire $300 received in 1962 in  redemption of the revolving fund certificate is includible in the  computation of P's gross income for the year 1962.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rule. If, for any taxable year ending before December 3,  1959, a taxpayer treated any patronage dividend received in the form of  a document described in paragraph (b) (1) (iii) or (iv) of this section  in accordance with the regulations then applicable (whether such  dividend is subject to paragraph (b) (1) or (3) of this section), such  taxpayer is not required to change the treatment of such patronage  dividends for any such prior taxable year. On the other hand, the  taxpayer may, if he so desires, amend his income tax returns to treat  the receipt of such patronage dividend in accordance with the provisions  of this section, but no provision in this paragraph shall be construed  as extending the period of limitations within which a claim for credit  or refund may be filed under section 6511.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Per-unit retain certificates; tax treatment of cooperative  associations; distribution and reinvestment alternative. (1)(i) In the  case of a taxable year to which this paragraph applies to a cooperative  association, such association shall, in computing the amount paid or  returned to a patron with respect to products marketed for such patron,  take into account the stated dollar amount of any per-unit retain  certificate (as defined in paragraph (g) of this section)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Which is issued during the payment period for such year (as  defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) with respect to such  products,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> With respect to which the patron is a qualifying patron (as  defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Which clearly states the fact that the patron has agreed to  treat the stated dollar amount thereof as representing a cash  distribution to him which he has reinvested in the cooperative  association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No amount shall be taken into account by a cooperative  association by reason of the issuance of a per-unit retain certificate  to a patron who was not a qualifying patron with respect to such  certificate. However, any amount paid in redemption of a per-unit retain  certificate which was issued to a patron who was not a qualifying patron  with respect to such certificate shall be taken into account by the  cooperative in the year of redemption, as an amount paid or returned to  such patron with respect to products marketed for him. This subdivision  shall apply only to per-unit retain certificates issued with respect to  taxable years of the cooperative association to which this paragraph  applied to the association (that is, taxable years with respect to which  per-unit retain certificates were issued to one or more patrons who are  qualifying patrons).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A patron shall be considered to be a ``qualifying patron''  with respect to a per-unit retain certificate if there is in effect an  agreement between the cooperative association and such patron which  clearly provides that such patron agrees to treat the stated dollar  amounts of all per-unit retain certificates issued to him by the  association as representing cash distributions which he has  constructively received and which he has, of his own choice, reinvested  in the cooperative association. Such an agreement may be included in a  by-law of the cooperative which is adopted prior to the time the  products to which the per-unit retain certificates relate are marketed.  However, except where there is in effect a ``written agreement''  described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a patron shall not  be considered to be a ``qualifying patron'' with respect to a per-unit  retain certificate if it has been   established by a determination of the Tax Court of the United States, or  any other court of competent jurisdiction, which has become final, that  the stated dollar amount of such certificate, or of a similar  certificate issued under similar circumstances to such patron or any  other patron by the cooperative association, is not required to be  included (as ordinary income) in the gross income of such patron, or  such other patron, for the taxable year of the patron in which received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The ``written agreement'' referred to in subdivision (i) of  this subparagraph is an agreement in writing, signed by the patron, on  file with the cooperative association, and revocable as provided in this  subdivision. Unless such an agreement specifically provides to the  contrary, it shall be effective for per-unit retain certificates issued  with respect to the taxable year of the cooperative association in which  the agreement is received by the association, and unless revoked, for  per-unit retain certificates issued with respect to all subsequent  taxable years. A ``written agreement'' must be revocable by the patron  at any time after the close of the taxable year in which it is made. To  be effective, a revocation must be in writing, signed by the patron, and  furnished to the cooperative association. A revocation shall be  effective only for per-unit retain certificates issued with respect to  taxable years of the cooperative association following the taxable year  in which it is furnished to the association. Notwithstanding the  preceding sentence, a revocation shall not be effective for per-unit  retain certificates issued with respect to products marketed for the  patron under a pooling arrangement in which such patron participated  before such revocation. The following is an example of an agreement  which would meet the requirements of this subparagraph:</p><p class="depth0">I agree that, for purposes of determining the amount I have received  from this cooperative in payment for my goods, I shall treat the face  amount of any per-unit retain certificates issued to me on and after -- -------- as representing a cash distribution which I have constructively  received and which I have reinvested in the cooperative.  ________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Signed)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (e) of this  section, the payment period for any taxable year of the cooperative is  the period beginning with the first day of such taxable year and ending  with the 15th day of the 9th month following the close of such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> This paragraph shall apply to any taxable year of a cooperative  association if, with respect to such taxable year, the association has  issued per-unit retain certificates to one or more of its patrons who  are qualifying patrons with respect to such certificates within the  meaning of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Tax treatment of cooperative association; taxable years for  which paragraph (d) does not apply. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a taxable year to  which paragraph (d) of this section does not apply to a cooperative  association, such association shall, in computing the amount paid or  returned to a patron with respect to products marketed for such patron,  take into account the fair market value (at the time of issue) of any  per-unit retain certificates which are issued by the association with  respect to such products during the payment period for such taxable  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An amount paid in redemption of a per-unit retain certificate  issued with respect to a taxable year of the cooperative association for  which paragraph (d) of this section did not apply to the association,  shall, to the extent such amount exceeds the fair market value of the  certificate at the time of its issue, be taken into account by the  association in the year of redemption, as an amount paid or returned to  a patron with respect to products marketed for such patron.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (f)(2) of this  section, any per-unit retain certificate containing an unconditional  promise to pay a fixed sum of money on demand or at a fixed or  determinable time shall be considered to have a fair market value at the  time of its issue, unless it is clearly established to the contrary. On  the other hand, any per-unit retain certificate (other than capital  stock) which is redeemable only in the discretion of the cooperative  association, or   which is otherwise subject to conditions beyond the control of the  patron, shall be considered not to have any fair market value at the  time of its issue, unless it is clearly established to the contrary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Tax treatment of patron. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The following rules apply for  purposes of computing the amount includible in gross income with respect  to a per-unit retain certificate which was issued to a patron by a  cooperative association with respect to a taxable year of such  association for which paragraph (d) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the patron is a qualifying patron with respect to such  certificate (within the meaning of paragraph (d) (2) of this section),  he shall, in accordance with his agreement, include (as ordinary income)  the stated dollar amount of the certificate in gross income for his  taxable year in which the certificate is received by him.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the patron is not a qualifying patron with respect to such  certificate, no amount is includible in gross income on the receipt of  the certificate; however, any gain on the redemption, sale, or other  disposition of such certificate shall, to the extent of the stated  dollar amount thereof, be considered as gain from the sale or exchange  of property which is not a capital asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the fair market value of a per-unit retain  certificate which is issued to a patron by a cooperative association  with respect to a taxable year of the association for which paragraph  (d) of this section does not apply shall be included, as ordinary  income, in the gross income of the patron for the taxable year in which  the certificate is received. Any gain on the redemption, sale, or other  disposition of such a per-unit retain certificate shall, to the extent  its stated dollar amount exceeds its fair market value at the time of  issue, be treated as gain on the redemption, sale, or other disposition  of property which is not a capital asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> ``Per-unit retain certificate'' defined. For purposes of  paragraphs (d), (e), and (f), of this section, the term ``per-unit  retain certificate'' means any capital stock, revolving fund  certificate, retain certificate, certificate of indebtedness, letter of  advice, or other written notice--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Which is issued to a patron with respect to products marketed  for such patron;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Which discloses to the patron the stated dollar amount allocated  to him on the books of the cooperative association; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The stated dollar amount of which is fixed without reference to  net earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective date.
