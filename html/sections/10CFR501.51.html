                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> OFE may prohibit by order the use of petroleum or natural gas as  a primary energy source or in amounts in excess of the minimum amount  necessary to maintain reliability of operation consistent with  reasonable fuel efficiency in an electing powerplant, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That facility has not been identified as a member of a category  subject to a final rule at the time of the issuance of such order; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requirements of Sec. 504.6 have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of order and public participation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OFE may hold a  conference with the proposed order recipient prior to issuing the  proposed order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to section 701 of FUA, prior to the issuance of a final  order to an electing powerplant, OFE shall publish a proposed order in  the Federal Register together with a statement of the reasons for the  order. In the case of a proposed order that would prohibit the use of  petroleum or natural gas as a primary energy source, the finding  required by former section 301(b)(1) of the Act shall be published with  such proposed order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> OFE shall provide a period for the submission of written  comments of at least three months after the date of the proposed order.  During this period, the recipient of the proposed order and any other  interested person must submit any evidence that they have determined at  that time to support their respective positions as to each of the  findings that OFE is required to make under section 301(b) of the Act. A  proposed order recipient may submit additional new evidence at any time  prior to the close of the public comment period which follows  publication of the Tentative Staff Analysis or prior to the close of the  record of any public hearing, whichever occurs later. A request by the  proposed order recipient for an extension of the three-month period may  be granted at OFE's discretion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subsequent to the end of the comment period, OFE will issue a  notice of whether OFE intends to proceed with the prohibition order  proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An owner or operator of a facility that may be subject to an  order may demonstrate prior to issuance of a final prohibition order  that the facility would qualify for an exemption if the prohibition had  been established by rule. OFE will not delay the issuance of a final  prohibition order or stay the effective date of such an order for the  purpose of determining whether a proposed order recipient qualifies for  a particular exemption unless the demonstration or qualification is  submitted prior to or during the second three-month comment period,  commencing after issuance of a notice of intention to proceed, or unless  materials submitted after the period (i) could not have been submitted  during the period through the exercise of due diligence, (ii) address  material changes in fact or law occurring after the close of the period,  or (iii) consist of amplification or rebuttal occasioned by the  subsequent course of the proceeding. A request by the proposed order  recipient for an extension of this time period may be granted at OFE's  discretion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Subsequent to the end of the second three (3) month period, OFE  will, if it intends to issue a final prohibition order, prepare and  issue a Notice of Availability of a Tentative Staff Analysis. Interested  persons wishing a hearing must request a hearing within forty-five (45)  day after issuance of the Notice of Availability of the Tentative Staff  Analysis. During this forty-five (45) days period, interested persons  may also submit written comments on the Tentative Staff Analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If a hearing has been requested, OFE shall provide interested  persons with an opportunity to present oral data, views and arguments at  a public hearing held in accordance with subpart C of this part. The  hearing will consider the findings which OFE must make in order to issue  a final prohibition order and any exemption for which the proposed order  recipient submitted   its demonstration in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Upon request by the recipient of the proposed prohibition order,  the combined public comment periods provided for in this section may be  reduced to a minimum of forty-five (45) days from the time of  publication of the proposed order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> OFE may terminate a prohibition order proceeding at any time  prior to the date upon which a final order shall become effective.  Should OFE terminate the proceeding, it will notify the proposed order  recipient, and publish a notice in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Decision to issue a final order. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OFE will base its  determination to issue an order on consideration of the whole record or  those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by and in accordance  with reliable, probative and substantial evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OFE shall include in the final order a written statement of the  pertinent facts, a statement of the basis upon which the final order is  issued, a recitation of the conclusions regarding the required findings  and qualifications for exemptions. The final order shall state the  effective date of the prohibition contained therein. If it is  demonstrated that the facility would have been granted a temporary  exemption, the effective date of the prohibition contained in the final  order shall be delayed until such time as the temporary exemption would  have terminated. If it is demonstrated that a facility will need a  period of time to comply with the final order, the effective date of the  prohibition contained in the final order may be delayed, in OFE's  discretion, so as to allow an order recipient to comply with the final  order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> OFE will enclose with a copy of the final order, where  appropriate, a schedule of steps that should be taken by a stated date  (a compliance schedule) to ensure that the affected facility will be  able to comply with the prohibitions stated in the order by the  effective date of the prohibition contained in the final order. The  compliance schedule may require the affected person to take steps with  regard to a unit 60 days after service of the final order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A copy of the final order and a summary of the basis therefore  will be published in the Federal Register. The order will become  effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Request for order. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A proceeding for issuance of a  prohibition order to a specific unit may be commenced by OFE, in its  sole discretion, in response to a request for an order filed by the  owner or operator of a facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A petition requesting OFE to commence a prohibition order  proceeding should include the following information for all units to be  covered by the prohibition order:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement of the reasons the owner or operator is seeking the  issuance of a prohibition order; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sufficient information for OFE to make the findings required by  section 301(b) of FUA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If OFE determines to accept the request, OFE shall publish a  proposed order in the Federal Register together with a statement of the  reasons for the order.
