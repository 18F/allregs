                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A CDC's portfolio must maintain a minimum average of one Job Opportunity per an amount of 504 loan funding that will be specified by SBA from time to time in a Federal Register

notice. Such Job Opportunity average remains in effect until changed by subsequent Federal Register publication. A CDC is permitted two years from its certification date to meet this average.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A CDC must indicate in its annual report the Job Opportunities actually or estimated to be provided by each Project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a CDC does not maintain the required average, it may retain its certification if it justifies to SBA's satisfaction its failure to do so in its annual report and shows how it intends to attain the required average.
