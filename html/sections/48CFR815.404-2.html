The contracting officer must ensure, with the assistance of the Assistant Inspector General for Policy, Planning, and Resources, as required or considered necessary, that VA will not pay the costs twice. For example, the cost of equipment that the Government pays for through a setup or connection agreement must not be included in depreciation cost of a subsequently negotiated agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 815.6_Unsolicited Proposals</p>
