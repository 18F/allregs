If such a wage determination is not used in the period of its effectiveness it is void. Accordingly, if it appears that a wage determination may expire between bid opening and contract award (or between initial endorsement under the National Housing Act or the execution of an agreement to enter into a housing assistance payments contract under section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, and the start of construction) the agency shall request a new wage determination sufficiently in advance of the bid opening to assure receipt prior thereto. However, when due to unavoidable circumstances a determination expires before award but after bid opening (or before the start of construction, but after initial endorsement under the National Housing Act, or before the start of construction but after the execution of an agreement to enter into a housing assistance payments contract under section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937), the head of the agency or his or her designee may request the Administrator to extend the expiration date of the wage determination in the bid specifications instead of issuing a new wage determination. Such request shall be supported by a written finding, which shall include a brief statement of the factual support, that the extension of the expiration date of the determination is necessary and proper in the public interest to prevent injustice or undue hardship or to avoid serious impairment in the conduct of Government business. The Administrator will either grant or deny the request for an extension after consideration of all of the circumstances, including an examination to determine if the previously issued rates remain prevailing. If the request for extension is denied, the Administrator will proceed to issue a new wage determination for the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Project wage determinations initially issued shall be effective for 180 calendar days from the date of such determinations.

Archived versions of Davis-Bacon and Related Acts wage determinations that are no longer current may be accessed in the ``Archived DB WD'' database of WDOL for information purposes only.

archived wage determination in a contract action without prior approval of the Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A supersedeas wage determination or a modification to an applicable general wage determination, notice of which is published after contract award (or after the beginning of construction where there is no contract award) shall not be effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon his/her own initiative or at the request of an agency, the Administrator may correct any wage determination, without regard to paragraph (c) of this section, whenever the Administrator finds such a wage determination contains clerical errors.

Further, the Administrator may issue a wage determination which shall be applicable to a contract after contract award or after the beginning of construction when it is found that the wrong wage determination has been incorporated in the contract because of an inaccurate description of the project or its location in the agency's request for the wage determination. Under any of the above circumstances, the agency shall either terminate and resolicit the contract with the valid wage determination, or incorporate the valid wage determination retroactive to the beginning of construction through supplemental agreement or through change order, Provided That the contractor is compensated for any increases in wages resulting from such change. The method of incorporation of the valid wage determination, and adjustment in contract price, where appropriate, should be in accordance with applicable procurement law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If Federal funding or assistance under a statute requiring payment of wages determined in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act is not approved prior to contract award (or the beginning of construction where there is no contract award), the agency shall request a wage determination prior to approval of such funds. Such a wage determination shall be issued based upon the wages and fringe benefits found to be prevailing on the date of award or the beginning of construction (under the National Housing Act, under section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 or where there is no contract award), as appropriate, and shall be incorporated in the contract specifications retroactively to that date, Provided, That upon the request of the head of the agency in individual cases the Administrator may issue such a wage determination to be effective on the date of approval of Federal funds or assistance whenever the Administrator finds that it is necessary and proper in the public interest to prevent injustice or undue hardship, Provided further That the Administrator finds no evidence of intent to apply for Federal funding or assistance prior to contract award or the start of construction, as appropriate.
