                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Bids may be modified or withdrawn by any method authorized by  the solicitation, if notice is received in the office designated in the  solicitation not later than the exact time set for opening of bids.  Unless proscribed by agency regulations, a telegraphic modification or  withdrawal of a bid received in such office by telephone from the  receiving telegraph office shall be considered. However, the message  shall be confirmed by the telegraph company by sending a copy of the  written telegram that formed the basis for the telephone call. If the  solicitation authorizes facsimile bids, bids may be modified or  withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set  for receipt of bids, subject to the conditions specified in the  provision prescribed in 14.201-6(v). Modifications received by telephone  (including a record of those telephoned by the telegraph company) or  facsimile shall be sealed in an envelope by a proper official. The  official shall write on the envelope (1) the date and time of receipt  and by whom, and (2) the number of the invitation for bids, and shall  sign the envelope. No information contained in the envelope shall be  disclosed before the time set for bid opening.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A bid may be withdrawn in person by a bidder or its authorized  representative if, before the exact time set for   opening of bids, the identity of the persons requesting withdrawal is  established and that person signs a receipt for the bid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon withdrawal of an electronically transmitted bid, the data  received shall not be viewed and shall be purged from primary and backup  data storage systems.
