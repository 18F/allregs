                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Test and manufacturing records C general. Every manufacturer and  any other person initially introducing into commerce mattress sets  subject to the standard, irrespective of whether guarantees are issued  relative thereto, shall maintain the following records in English at a  location in the United States:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Test results and details of each test performed by or for that  manufacturer (including failures), whether for qualification,  confirmation, or production, in accordance with Sec. 1633.7. Details  shall include: name and complete physical address of test facility, type  of test room, test room conditions, time that sample spent out of  conditioning area before starting test, prototype or production  identification number, and test data including the peak rate of heat  release, total heat release in first 10 minutes, a graphic depiction of  the peak rate of heat release and total heat release over time. These  records shall include the name and signature of person conducting the  test, the date of the test, and a certification by the person overseeing  the testing as to the test results and that the test was carried out in  accordance with the Standard. For confirmation tests, the identification  number must be that of the prototype tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Video and/or a minimum of eight photographs of the testing of  each mattress set, in accordance with Sec. 1633.7 (one taken before the  test starts, one taken within 45 seconds of the start of the test, and  the remaining six taken at five minute intervals, starting at 5 minutes  and ending at 30 minutes), with the prototype identification number or  production lot identification number of the mattress set, date and time  of test, and name and location of testing facility clearly displayed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prototype records. In addition to the records specified in  paragraph (a) of this section, the following records shall be maintained  for each qualified, confirmed and subordinate prototype:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unique identification number for the qualified or confirmed  prototype and a list of the unique identification numbers of each  subordinate prototype based on the qualified or confirmed prototype.  Subordinate prototypes that differ from each other only be length or  width may share the same identification number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A detailed description of all materials, components, and methods  of assembly for each qualified, confirmed and subordinate prototype.  Such description shall include the specifications of all materials and  components, and the name and complete physical address of each material  and component supplier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A list of which models and production lots of mattress sets are  represented by each qualified, confirmed and/or subordinate prototype  identification number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For subordinate prototypes, the prototype identification number  of the qualified or confirmed prototype on which the mattress set is  based, and, at a minimum, the manufacturing specifications and a  description of the materials substituted, photographs or physical  specimens of the substituted materials, and documentation based on  objectively reasonable criteria that the change in any component,  material, or method of assembly will not cause the subordinate prototype  to exceed the test criteria specified in Sec. 1633.3(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Identification, composition, and details of the application of  any flame retardant treatments and/or inherently flame resistant fibers  or other materials employed in mattress components.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pooling confirmation test records. In addition to the test and  prototype records specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section,  the following records shall be maintained:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The prototype identification number assigned by the qualified  prototype manufacturer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name and complete physical address of the qualified prototype  manufacturer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Copy of qualified prototype test records, and records required  by paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of imported mattress sets, the importer shall be  responsible for maintaining the records specified in paragraph (b) of  this section for confirmation testing that has been performed with  respect to mattress sets produced by each foreign manufacturing facility  whose mattress sets that importer is importing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Quality assurance records. In addition to the records required  by paragraph (a) of this section, the following quality assurance  records shall be maintained:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written copy of the manufacturer's quality assurance  procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records of any production tests performed. Production test  records must be maintained and shall include, in addition to the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, an assigned production  lot identification number and the identification number of the  qualified, confirmed or subordinate prototype associated with the  specimen tested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each qualified, confirmed and subordinate prototype, the  number of mattress sets in each production lot based on that prototype;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The start and end dates of production of that lot; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Component, material and assembly records. Every manufacturer  conducting tests and/or technical evaluations of components and  materials and/or methods of assembly must maintain detailed records of  such tests and evaluations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Record retention requirements. The records required under this  Section shall be maintained by the manufacturer (including importers)  for as long as mattress sets based on the prototype in question are in  production and shall be retained for 3 years thereafter. Records shall  be available upon the request of Commission staff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Record location requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For mattress sets produced in  the United States, all records required by this section must be  maintained at the plant or factory at which the mattress sets are  manufactured or assembled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For mattress sets produced outside of the United States, a copy  of all records required by this section must be maintained at a U.S.  location, which must be identified on the mattress set label as  specified in Sec. 1633.12(a).</p>
