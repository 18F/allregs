                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Recovery of overpayments of any benefits made under laws administered by the VA shall be waived if there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the part of the person or persons having an interest in obtaining the waiver and recovery of the indebtedness from the payee who received such benefits would be against equity and good conscience.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. A request for waiver of an indebtedness under this section shall only be considered:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If made within 2 years following the date of a notice of indebtedness issued on or before March 31, 1983, by the Department of Veterans Affairs to the debtor, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as otherwise provided herein, if made within 180 days following the date of a notice of indebtedness issued on or after April 1, 1983, by the Department of Veterans Affairs to the debtor. The 180 day period may be extended if the individual requesting waiver demonstrated to the Chairperson of the Committee on Waivers and Compromises that, as a result of an error by either the Department of Veterans Affairs or the postal authorities, or due to other circumstances beyond the debtor's control, there was a delay in such individual's receipt of the notification of indebtedness beyond the time customarily required for mailing (including forwarding). If the requester does substantiate that there was such a delay in the receipt of the notice of indebtedness, the Chairperson shall direct that the 180 day period be computed from the date of the requester's

actual receipt of the notice of indebtedness.

Sec.  1.963a  Waiver; erroneous payments of pay and allowances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions applicable to VA (including refunds) concerning waiver actions relating to erroneous payments to VA employees of pay and allowances, and travel, transportation, and relocation expenses and allowances, are set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5584. The members of Committees on Waivers and Compromises assigned to waiver actions under Sec.  1.955 of this part are delegated all authority granted the Secretary under 5 U.S.C. 5584 to deny waiver or to grant waiver in whole or in part of any debt regardless of the amount of the indebtedness. Committee members also have exclusive authority to consider and render a decision on the appeal of a waiver denial or the granting of a partial waiver. However, the Chairperson of the Committee must assign the appeal to a different Committee member or members than the member or members who made the original decision that is now the subject of the appeal. The following are the only provisions of Sec. Sec.  1.955 through 1.970 of this part applicable to waiver actions concerning erroneous payments of pay and allowances, and travel, transportation, and relocation expenses and allowances, under 5 U.S.C. 5584: Sec. Sec.  1.955(a) through (e)(2), 1.956(a)(introductory text) and (a)(3), 1.959, 1.960, 1.963a, and 1.967(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waiver may be granted under this section and 5 U.S.C. 5584 when collection would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interest of the United States. Generally, these criteria will be met by a finding that the erroneous payment occurred through administrative error and that there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee or other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim, and waiver would not otherwise be inequitable. Generally, waiver is precluded when an employee receives a significant unexplained increase in pay or allowances, or otherwise knows, or reasonably should know, that an erroneous payment has occurred, and fails to make inquiries or bring the matter to the attention of the appropriate officials. Waiver under this standard will depend upon the facts existing in each case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An application for waiver must be received within 3 years immediately following the date on which the erroneous payment was discovered.
(Authority: 5 U.S.C. 5584; 38 U.S.C. 501).
