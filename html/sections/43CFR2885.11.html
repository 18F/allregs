                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Duration. All grants, except those issued for a term of 3 years  or less, will expire on December 31 of the final year of the grant. The  term of a grant may not exceed 30 years. The term of a TUP may not  exceed 3 years. BLM will consider the following factors in establishing  a reasonable term:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost of the pipeline and related facilities you plan to  construct, operate, maintain, or terminate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The pipeline's or related facility's useful life;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The public purpose served; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any potentially conflicting land uses; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Terms and conditions of use. BLM may modify your proposed use or  change the route or location of the facilities in your application. By  accepting a grant or TUP, you agree to use the lands described in the  grant or TUP for the purposes set forth in the grant or TUP. You also  agree to comply with, and be bound by, the following terms and  conditions. During construction, operation, maintenance, and termination  of the project you must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To the extent practicable, comply with all existing and  subsequently enacted, issued, or amended Federal laws and regulations,  and state laws and regulations applicable to the authorized use;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rebuild and repair roads, fences, and established trails  destroyed or damaged by constructing, operating, maintaining, or  terminating the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Build and maintain suitable crossings for existing roads and  significant trails that intersect the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Do everything reasonable to prevent and suppress fires on or in  the immediate vicinity of the right-of-way or TUP area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Not discriminate against any employee or applicant for  employment during any phase of the project because of race, creed,  color, sex, or national origin.

Sec. 2885.19  and 2885.23 of this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If BLM requires, obtain and/or certify that you have obtained a  surety bond or other acceptable security to cover any losses, damages,  or injury to human health, the environment, and property incurred in  connection with your use and occupancy of the right-of-way or TUP area,  including terminating the grant or TUP, and to secure all obligations  imposed by the grant or   TUP and applicable laws and regulations. Your bond must cover liability  for damages or injuries resulting from releases or discharges of  hazardous materials. BLM may require a bond, an increase or decrease in  the value of an existing bond, or other acceptable security at any time  during the term of the grant or TUP. This bond is in addition to any  individual lease, statewide, or nationwide oil and gas bonds you may  have;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Assume full liability if third parties are injured or damages  occur to property on or near the right-of-way or TUP area (see Sec.  2886.13 of this part);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Comply with project-specific terms, conditions, and  stipulations, including requirements to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Restore, revegetate, and curtail erosion or any other  rehabilitation measure BLM determines is necessary;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ensure that activities in connection with the grant or TUP  comply with air and water quality standards or related facility siting  standards contained in applicable Federal or state law or regulations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Control or prevent damage to scenic, aesthetic, cultural, and  environmental values, including fish and wildlife habitat, and to public  and private property and public health and safety;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Protect the interests of individuals living in the general area  who rely on the area for subsistence uses as that term is used in Title  VIII of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 3111 et seq.); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Ensure that you construct, operate, maintain, and terminate the  facilities on the lands in the right-of-way or TUP area in a manner  consistent with the grant or TUP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Immediately notify all Federal, state, tribal, and local  agencies of any release or discharge of hazardous material reportable to  such entity under applicable law.

This means that the pipeline owners and operators must accept,  convey, transport, or purchase without discrimination all oil or gas  delivered to the pipeline without regard to where the oil and gas was  produced (i.e., whether on Federal or non-federal lands). Where natural  gas not subject to state regulatory or conservation laws governing its  purchase by pipeline companies is offered for sale, each pipeline  company must purchase, without discrimination, any such natural gas  produced in the vicinity of the pipeline. Common carrier provisions of  this paragraph do not apply to natural gas pipelines operated by a:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Person subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act (15  U.S.C. 717 et seq.); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Public utility subject to regulation by state or municipal  agencies with the authority to set rates and charges for the sale of  natural gas to consumers within the state or municipality.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Within 30 calendar days after BLM requests it, file rate  schedules and tariffs for oil and gas, or derivative products,  transported by the pipeline as a common carrier with the agency   BLM prescribes, and provide BLM proof that you made the required filing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> With certain exceptions (listed in the statute), not export  domestically produced crude oil by pipeline without Presidential  approval (see 30 U.S.C. 185(u) and (s) and 50 U.S.C.

If you need a right-of- way wider than 50 feet plus the ground occupied by the pipeline and  related facilities, see Sec. 2885.14 of this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(20)</em> Not use the right-of-way or TUP area for any use other than  that authorized by the grant or TUP. If you require other pipelines,  looping lines, or other improvements not authorized by the grant or TUP,  you must first secure BLM's written authorization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(21)</em> Not use or construct on the land in the right-of-way or TUP  area until:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> BLM approves your detailed plan for construction, operation, and  termination of the pipeline, including provisions for rehabilitation of  the right-of-way or TUP area and environmental protection; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You receive a Notice to Proceed for all or any part of the  right-of-way or TUP area. In certain situations BLM may waive this  requirement in writing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(22)</em> Comply with all other stipulations that BLM may require.
