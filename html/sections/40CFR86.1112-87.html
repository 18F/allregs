                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A manufacturer that has elected to conduct a PCA in accordance  with Sec. 86.1106-87 may establish the compliance level for a pollutant  for any engine or vehicle configuration by using the primary PCA  sampling plan or either of two optional reduced PCA sampling plans (the  fixed reduced sampling plan or the sequential reduced sampling plan)  described below. A manufacturer that uses either of the two optional  reduced PCA sampling plans may elect to continue testing and establish a  compliance level under the primary PCA sampling plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A manufacturer that elects to conduct a PCA for a pollutant  using the primary PCA sampling plan shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conduct emission tests on 24 engines or vehicles in accordance  with Sec. 86.1111-87 for the pollutants for which the PCA was initiated.  If the PCA follows an SEA failure, the number of additional tests  conducted shall be the difference between 24 and the number of engines  or vehicles tested in the SEA. If 24 or more engines or vehicles were  tested in the SEA, no additional tests shall be conducted; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Rank the final deteriorated test results, as defined by  paragraph (e) of this section, obtained for that pollutant in order from  the lowest to the highest value. If the PCA follows an SEA failure, all  SEA test results for that pollutant shall be included in this ranking.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The compliance level for that pollutant is the final  deteriorated test result in the sequence determined from table 1 of  appendix XII of these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A manufacturer that elects to conduct a PCA for a pollutant  using the fixed reduced PCA sampling plan shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Select a sample size between 3 and 23 engines or vehicles. If  the PCA follows an SEA failure, the sample size selected cannot be less  than the number of engines or vehicles tested during the SEA; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conduct emission tests on the selected sample in accordance  with Sec. 86.1111-87 for the pollutants for which the PCA was initiated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The compliance level for the pollutant is the result of the  following equation, using the test results obtained in paragraph  (a)(2)(ii) of this section and all SEA test results for that pollutant  if the PCA follows an SEA failure:  CL=X + Ks  where:  CL=The compliance level. X=The mean of the final deteriorated test results, as defined by</p><p class="depth4">paragraph (e) of this section. K=A value that depends on the size of the test sample. See table 2 of</p><p class="depth4">appendix XII of this part for the value of K that corresponds</p><p class="depth4">to the size of the test sample. s=The sample standard deviation.   The compliance level is rounded to the same number of significant  figures contained in the applicable standard in accordance with ASTM  E29-67.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A manufacturer that elects to conduct a PCA for a pollutant  using the sequential reduced PCA sampling plan shall perform the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Select a sample size of 4, 8, 12, 16 or 20 engines or vehicles.  If the PCA follows an SEA failure, the sample size selected cannot be  less than the number of engines or vehicles tested during the SEA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conduct emission tests on the selected sample in accordance  with Sec. 86.1111-87 for the pollutants for which the PCA was initiated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The compliance level for the pollutant is the result of the  following equation, using the test results obtained in (a)(3)(ii) and  all SEA test results for that pollutant if the PCA follows an SEA  failure:  CL=X + Ks  where:  CL=The compliance level. X=The mean of the final deteriorated test results, as defined by</p><p class="depth4">paragraph (e) of this section. K=A value that depends on the size of the test sample. See table 3 of</p><p class="depth4">appendix XII of this part for the value of K that corresponds</p><p class="depth4">to the size of the test sample. s=The sample standard deviation.   The compliance level is rounded to the same number of significant  figures contained in the applicable standard in accordance with ASTM  E29-67.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> After calculating a compliance level in accordance with  paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, a manufacturer may elect to  increase the sample size by 4 engines or vehicles, or a multiple  thereof, up to the maximum, including SEA engines or vehicles if any, of  20. Upon that election, the manufacturer shall add the additional  engines or vehicles to the sample and perform paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and  (a)(3)(iii) of this section. This election may be repeated if  appropriate. A compliance level determined under this election shall  replace a previously determined compliance level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A fail decision is reached with respect to the upper limit when  the compliance level determined in paragraph (a) of this section exceeds  the applicable upper limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Initial test results are calculated following the Federal Test  Procedure specified in Sec. 86.1111-87(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Final test results are calculated by summing the initial test  results derived in paragraph (c) of this section for each test engine or  vehicle, dividing by the number of tests conducted on the engine or  vehicle, and rounding in accordance with ASTM E29-67 to the same number  of decimal places contained in the applicable standard expressed to one  additional significant figure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Final deteriorated test results. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The final deteriorated test  results for each heavy-duty engine or light-duty truck tested according  to subpart B, I, N, or P of this part are calculated by applying the  final test results by the appropriate deterioration factor, derived from  the certification process for the engine family control system  combination and model year for the selected configuration to which the  test   engine or vehicle belongs. If the deterioration factor computed during  the certification process is multiplicative and it is less than one,  that deterioration factor will be one. If the deterioration factor  computed during the certification process is additive and it is less  than zero, that deterioration factor will be zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The final deteriorated test results are rounded to the same  number of significant figures contained in the applicable standard in  accordance with ASTM E29-67.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A failed engine or vehicle is one whose final deteriorated test  results, for one or more of the applicable exhaust pollutants, exceed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicable emission standard, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The compliance level established in paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Within five working days after completion of PCA testing of all  engines or vehicles, the manufacturer shall submit to the Administrator  a report which includes the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The location and description of the manufacturer's emission test  facilities which were utilized to conduct testing reported pursuant to  this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicable standards against which the engines or vehicles  were tested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deterioration factors for the engine family to which the  selected configuration belongs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the engine or vehicle and any emission-related  component selection method used;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each test conducted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Test engine or vehicle description, including;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Configuration and engine family identification,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Year, make and build date,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Engine or vehicle identification number, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Number of hours of service accumulated on engine or number of  miles on vehicle prior to testing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Location where service or mileage accumulation was conducted  and description of accumulation procedure and schedule;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Test number, date, initial test results before and after  rounding, final test results and final deteriorated test results for all  emission tests, whether valid or invalid, and the reason for  invalidation, if applicable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A complete description of any modification, repair,  preparation, maintenance, and/or testing which was performed on the test  engine or vehicle and has not been reported pursuant to any other  paragraph of this subpart and will not be performed on all other  production engines or vehicles; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any other information the Administrator may request relevant to  the determination as to whether the new heavy-duty engines or heavy-duty  vehicles being manufactured by the manufacturer do in fact conform with  the regulations of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The following statement and endorsement:</p><p class="depth3">This report is submitted pursuant to section 206 of the Clean Air  Act.
