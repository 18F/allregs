                                Sec.  73.1201  Station identification.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When regularly required. Broadcast station identification  announcements shall be made:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At the beginning and ending of each time of operation, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hourly, as close to the hour as feasible, at a natural break in  program offerings. Television and Class A television broadcast stations  may make these announcements visually or aurally.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Official station identification shall consist of  the station's call letters immediately followed by the community or  communities specified in its license as the station's location;  Provided, That the name of the licensee, the station's frequency, the  station's channel number, as stated on the station's license, and/or the  station's network affiliation may be inserted between the call letters  and station location. DTV stations, or DAB Stations, choosing to include  the station's channel number in the station identification must use the  station's major channel number and may distinguish multicast program  streams. For example, a DTV station with major channel number 26 may use  26.1 to identify an HDTV program service and 26.2 to identify an SDTV  program service. A DTV station that is devoting one of its multicast  streams to transmit the programming of another television licensee must  identify itself and may also identify the licensee that it is  transmitting. If a DTV station in this situation chooses to identify the  station that is the source of the programming it is transmitting, it  must use the following format: Station WYYY-DT, community of license  (call sign and community of license of the station whose multicast  stream is transmitting the programming), bringing you WXXX, community of  license (call sign and community of license of the licensee providing  the programming). The transmitting station may insert between its call  letters and its community of license the following information: the  frequency of the transmitting station, the channel number of the  transmitting station, the name of the licensee of the transmitting  station and the licensee providing the programming, and/or the name of  the network of either station. Where a multicast station is carrying the  programming of another station and is identifying that station as the  source of the programming, using the format described above, the  identification may not include the frequency or channel number of the  program source. A radio station operating in DAB hybrid mode or extended  hybrid mode shall identify its digital signal, including any free  multicast audio programming streams, in a manner that appropriately  alerts its audience to the fact that it is listening to a digital audio  broadcast. No other insertion between the station's call letters and the  community or communities specified in its license is permissible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A station may include in its official station identification the  name of any additional community or communities, but the community to  which the station is licensed must be named first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Channel--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Except as otherwise provided in this  paragraph, in making the identification announcement the call letters  shall be given only on the channel, or channels in the case of a  broadcaster that is multicasting more than a single channel, identified  thereby.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Simultaneous AM (535-1605 kHz) and AM (1605-1705 kHz broadcasts.  If the same licensee operates an AM broadcast station in the 535-1605  kHz band and an AM broadcast station in the 1605-1705 kHz band with both  stations licensed to the same community and simultaneously broadcasts  the same programs over the facilities of both such stations, station  identification announcements may be made jointly for both stations for  periods of such simultaneous operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Satellite operation. When programming of a broadcast station is  rebroadcast simultaneously over the facilities of a satellite station,  the originating   station may make identification announcements for the satellite station  for periods of such simultaneous operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a television broadcast station, such  announcements, in addition to the information required by paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, shall include the number of the channel on which  each station is operating.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of aural broadcast stations, such announcements, in  addition to the information required by paragraph (b)(1) of this  section, shall include the frequency on which each station is operating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subscription television stations (STV). The requirements for  official station identification applicable to TV stations will apply to  Subscription TV stations except, during STV-encoded programming such  station identification is not required. However, a station  identification announcement will be made immediately prior to and  following the encoded Subscription TV program period.
