                            <p class="depth0">In reaching presumed determinations for economic loss for Personal  Representatives bringing claims on behalf of decedents, the Special  Master shall consider sums corresponding to the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Loss of earnings or other benefits related to employment. The  Special Master, as part of the process of reaching a ``determination''  pursuant to section 405(b) of the Act, shall develop a methodology and  publish schedules, tables, or charts that will permit prospective  claimants to estimate determinations   of loss of earnings or other benefits related to employment based upon  individual circumstances of the deceased victim, including: The age of  the decedent as of the date of death; the number of dependents who  survive the decedent; whether the decedent is survived by a spouse; and  the amount and nature of the decedent's income for recent years. The  Decedent's salary/income in the three years preceding the year of death  (or for other years the Special Master deems relevant) shall be  evaluated in a manner that the Special Master deems appropriate. The  Special Master may, if she deems appropriate, take an average of income  figures for the three years preceding the year of death, and may also  consider income for other periods that she deems appropriate, including  published pay scales for victims who were government or military  employees. The Special Master's methodology and schedules, tables, or  charts shall yield presumed determinations of loss of earnings or other  benefits related to employment for annual incomes up to but not beyond  the 98th percentile of individual income in the United States for the  year preceding the year of death. In cases where the victim was a minor  child, the Special Master may assume an average income for the child  commensurate with the average income of all wage earners in the United  States. For victims who were members of the armed services or government  employees such as firefighters or police officers, the Special Master  may consider all forms of compensation (or pay) to which the victim was  entitled. For example, military service members' and uniformed service  members' compensation includes all of the various components of  compensation, including, but not limited to, basic pay (BPY), basic  allowance for housing (BAH), basic allowance for subsistence (BAS),  federal income tax advantage (TAD), overtime bonuses, differential pay,  and longevity pay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Medical expense loss. This loss equals the out-of-pocket medical  expenses that were incurred as a result of the physical harm suffered by  the victim (i.e., those medical expenses that were not paid for or  reimbursed through health insurance or other programs for which the  claimant was not charged). This loss shall be calculated on a case-by- case basis, using documentation and other information submitted by the  Personal Representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Replacement services loss. For decedents who did not have any  prior earned income, or who worked only part-time outside the home,  economic loss may be determined with reference to replacement services  and similar measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Loss due to death/burial costs. This loss shall be calculated on  a case-by-case basis, using documentation and other information  submitted by the personal representative and includes the out-of pocket  burial costs that were incurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Loss of business or employment opportunities. Such losses shall  be addressed through the procedure outlined above in paragraph (a) of  this section.</p>
