                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. An owner or operator of a commercial vessel  permitted or required to be permitted in the Atlantic Tunas Longline  category under Sec. 635.4, and that has pelagic longline gear on board,  is required to have installed, operate, and maintain an electronic  monitoring (EM) system on the vessel, as specified in this section.  Vessel owner or operators can contact NMFS or a NMFS-approved contractor  for more details on procuring an EM system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> EM Installation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NMFS or a NMFS-approved contractor will  assess individual Atlantic Tunas Longline permitted vessels that are  currently eligible for IBQ share, install and test all EM systems;  provide training to vessel owners or operators or their designees; and  develop in consultation with vessel owners or operators or their  designees required operational plans (Vessel Monitoring Plan or VMP) for  the EM systems, as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vessel owners or operators, as instructed by NMFS, will be  required to coordinate with NMFS or a NMFS-approved contractor to  schedule a date or range of dates for EM installation, and/or may be  required to steam to a designated port for EM installation on NMFS- determined dates. NMFS may require vessel owners to make minor  modifications to vessel equipment to facilitate installation and  operation of   the EM system, such as, but not limited to, installation of a fitting  for the pressure side of the line of the drum hydraulic system, a power  supply for the EM system and power switches/connections, additional  lighting, and/or a mounting structure(s) for installation of the  camera(s). EM installation must be completed by June 1, 2015 in order to  fish with pelagic longline gear after that date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Certificate of Installation. After confirming that an EM system  that meets the requirements of this section is properly installed, the  system has been tested, and training and a required operational plan  (VMP) are completed, NMFS or the NMFS-approved contractor will provide a  Certificate of Installation to the vessel owner or operator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Vessels described under paragraph (a) of this section may not  depart on a fishing trip without having a valid Certificate of  Installation and VMP on board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> EM System Components. The EM system installed by the NMFS- approved contractor must be comprised of video camera(s), recording  equipment, and other related equipment and must have the following  components and capabilities:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Video camera(s). </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Video cameras must be mounted and placed so  as to provide clear, unobstructed views of the area(s) where the pelagic  longline gear is retrieved and of catch being removed from hooks prior  to being placed in the hold or discarded. There must be lighting  sufficient to illuminate clearly individual fish.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Video camera(s) must be in sufficient numbers (a minimum of two  and up to four), with sufficient resolution (no less than 720p (1280 x  720)) for NMFS, the USCG, and their authorized officers and designees,  or any individual authorized by NMFS to determine the number and species  of fish harvested. To obtain the views described in paragraph (c)(1)(i),  at least one camera must be mounted to record close-up images of fish  being retained on the deck at the haulback station, and at least one  camera must be mounted to record activity at the waterline along the  side of the vessel at the haul back station. NMFS or the NMFS-approved  contractor will determine if more cameras are needed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The EM system must be capable of initiating video recording at  the time gear retrieval starts. It must record all periods of time when  the gear is being retrieved and catch is removed from the hooks until it  is placed in the hold or discarded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> GPS receiver. A GPS receiver is required to produce output,  which includes location coordinates, velocity, and heading data, and is  directly logged continuously by the control box. The GPS receiver must  be installed and remain in a location where it receives a strong signal  continuously.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hydraulic and drum rotation sensors. Hydraulic sensors are  required to continuously monitor the hydraulic pressure and a drum  rotation sensor must continuously monitor drum rotations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> EM control box. The system must include a control box that  receives and stores the raw data provided by the sensors and cameras.  The control box must contain removable hard drives and storage systems  adequate for a trip lasting 30 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> EM systems monitor. A wheelhouse monitor must provide a  graphical user interface for harvester to monitor the state and  performance of the control box and provide information on the current  date and time synchronized via GPS, GPS coordinates, current hydraulic  pressure reading, presence of a data disk, percentage used of the data  disk, and video recording status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The EM system must have software that enables the system to be  tested for functionality and that records the outcome of the tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Data maintenance, storage, and viewing. The EM system must have  the capacity to allow NMFS, the USCG, and their authorized officers and  designees, or any NMFS-approved contractor to observe the live video on  the EM systems monitor as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.  Vessel owner or operators must provide access to the system, including  the data upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Operation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise authorized by NMFS in writing, a  vessel   described in paragraph (a) of this section must collect video and sensor  data in accordance with the requirements in this section, in order to  fish with pelagic longline gear.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vessel monitoring plan. The vessel owner or operator must have  available onboard a written VMP for its system, which is an operational  plan developed by the NMFS-approved contractor containing the  standardized procedures relating to the vessel's EM system. VMPs may  include, but are not limited to, information on the locations of EM  system components; contact information for technical support;  instructions on how to conduct a pre-trip system test; instructions on  how to verify proper system functions; location(s) on deck where fish  retrieval should occur to remain in view of the cameras; procedures for  how to manage EM system hard drives; catch handling procedures; a size  reference for facilitating determination of fish size; periodic checks  of the monitor during the retrieval of gear to verify proper  functioning; reporting procedures. The VMP should minimize to the extent  practicable any impact on the current operating procedures of the  vessel, and should help ensure the safety of the crew.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Handling of fish and duties of care. The vessel owner or  operator must ensure that all fish that are caught, even those that are  released, are handled in a manner that enables the video system to  record such fish, and must ensure that all handling and retention of  bluefin tuna occurs in accordance with relevant regulations and the  operational procedures outlined in the VMP. The vessel owner or operator  is responsible for ensuring the proper continuous functioning of the EM  system, including that the EM system must remain powered on for the  duration of each fishing trip from the time of departure to time of  return; cameras must be cleaned routinely; and EM system components must  not be tampered with.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Completion of trip. Within 48 hours of completing a fishing  trip,, the vessel owner or operator must mail the removable EM system  hard drive(s) containing all data to NMFS or NMFS-approved contractor,  according to instructions provided by NMFS. The vessel owner or operator  is responsible for using shipping materials suitable to protect the hard  drives (e.g.,, bubble wrap), tracking the package, and including a self- addressed mailing label for the next port of call so replacement hard  drives can be mailed back to the vessel owner or operator. Prior to  departing on a subsequent trip, the vessel owner or operator must  install a replacement EM system hard drive(s) to enable data collection  and video recording. The vessel owner or operator is responsible for  contacting NMFS or NMFS-approved contractor if they have requested but  not received a replacement hard drive(s) and for informing NMFS or NMFS- approved contractor of any lapse in the hard drive management procedures  described in the VMP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Failure to adequately monitor the gear and catch. The vessel  owner or operator must monitor and maintain the EM system in working  condition, which includes ensuring the proper continuous functioning of  the EM system, cameras provide clear unobstructed views, and video  picture quality is clear. Prior to departing on a trip with pelagic  longline gear on board, the vessel owner or operator must test the  functionality of the system and contact NMFS or the NMFS-approved  contractor if the system is not functioning properly. In that case, or  if NMFS independently determines that an EM system fails to meet the  requirements of this section, the vessel cannot leave port unless and  until NMFS provides written authorization. NMFS may grant such  authorization after confirming that an EM system is functioning properly  or other circumstances as determined by NMFS warrant authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Repair and replacement. If the vessel owner or operator becomes  aware that the EM system on the vessel is not functioning properly at  sea, the vessel owner or operator must contact NMFS and follow the  instructions given. Such instructions may include but are not limited to  returning to port until the EM system is repaired. Once in port, an EM  system must be functioning properly (e.g., repaired, reinstalled, or  replaced) consistent with the installation requirements in this section  before the   vessel can fish with pelagic longline gear.
