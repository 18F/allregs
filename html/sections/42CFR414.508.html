                            <p class="depth0">For a new clinical diagnostic laboratory test that is assigned a new or substantially revised code on or after January 1, 2005, CMS determines the payment amount based on either of the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Crosswalking. Crosswalking is used if it is determined that a new test is comparable to an existing test, multiple existing test codes, or a portion of an existing test code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS assigns to the new test code, the local fee schedule amounts and national limitation amount of the existing test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment for the new test code is made at the lesser of the local fee schedule amount or the national limitation amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Gapfilling. Gapfilling is used when no comparable existing test is available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the first year, carrier-specific amounts are established for the new test code using the following sources of information to determine gapfill amounts, if available:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Charges for the test and routine discounts to charges;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Resources required to perform the test;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Payment amounts determined by other payers; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Charges, payment amounts, and resources required for other tests that may be comparable or otherwise relevant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the second year, the test code is paid at the national limitation amount, which is the median of the carrier-specific amounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For a new test for which a new or substantially revised HCPCS code was assigned on or before December 31, 2007, after the first year of gapfilling, CMS determines whether the carrier-specific amounts will pay for the test appropriately. If CMS determines that the carrier-specific amounts will not pay for the test appropriately, CMS may crosswalk the test.
