The EEI filing to the Automated Export System (AES) covering an export made under an SCL must be prepared in accordance with requirements of the Foreign Trade Regulations (15 CFR Part 30) and Sec. 758.1 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Item descriptions. Item descriptions on the EEI must indicate specifically the ECCN and item description conforming to the applicable CCL description and incorporating any additional information where required by Schedule B (e.g., type, size, name of specific item, etc.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Value of shipments. There is no value limitation on shipments under the SCL; however, you must indicate the value of each shipment on EEI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> SCL number. The EEI must include the Special Comprehensive License (SCL) number in the License Number field and the name of the SCL's approved consignee in the Ultimate Consignee field to whom the shipment is authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Destination control statement. The SCL holder and consignees must enter a destination control statement on all copies of the bill of lading or air way-bill, and the commercial invoice covering exports under the SCL, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 758.6 of the EAR. Use of a destination control statement does not preclude the consignee from reexporting to any of the SCL holder's other approved consignees or to other countries for which specific prior approval has been received from BIS. In such instances, reexport is not contrary to U.S. law and, therefore, is not prohibited. Another destination control statement may be required or approved by BIS on a case-by-case basis.
