                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A person who is required to register must maintain records  concerning the manufacture, acquisition and disposition (to include  copies of all documentation on exports using exemptions and applications  and licenses and their related documentation), of defense articles; of  technical data; the provision of defense services; brokering activities;  and information on political contributions, fees, or commissions  furnished or obtained, as required by part 130 of this subchapter.  Records in an electronic format must be maintained using a process or  system capable of reproducing all records on paper. Such records when  displayed on a viewer, monitor, or reproduced on paper, must exhibit a  high degree of legibility and readability. (For the purpose of this  section, ``legible'' and ``legibility'' mean the quality of a letter or  numeral that enables the observer to identify it positively and quickly  to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. ``Readable'' and  ``readability'' means the quality of a group of letters or numerals  being recognized as complete words or numbers.) This information must be  stored in such a manner that none of it may be altered once it is  initially recorded without recording all changes, who made them, and  when they were made. For processes or systems based on the storage of  digital images, the process or system must afford accessibility to all  digital images in the records being maintained. All records subject to  this section must be maintained for a period of five years from the  expiration of the license or   other approval, to include exports using an exemption (see Sec. 123.26  of this subchapter); or, from the date of the transaction (e.g., expired  licenses or other approvals relevant to the export transaction using an  exemption). The Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Defense Trade  Controls and the Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls  Licensing may prescribe a longer or shorter period in individual cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records maintained under this section shall be available at all  times for inspection and copying by the Directorate of Defense Trade  Controls or a person designated by the Directorate of Defense Trade  Controls (e.g., the Diplomatic Security Service) or U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement, or U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Upon such  request, the person maintaining the records must furnish the records,  the equipment, and if necessary, knowledgeable personnel for locating,  reading, and reproducing any record that is required to be maintained in  accordance with this section.
