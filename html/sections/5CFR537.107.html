                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before an employing agency makes any loan payments for an  employee, the employee (or job candidate) must sign a written service  agreement to complete a specified period of service with the agency and  to reimburse the agency for the student loan repayment benefit when  required by Sec. 537.109. The service agreement also may specify any  other employment conditions the agency considers to be appropriate,  including the employee's (or job candidate's) position and the duties he  or she is expected to perform, his or her work schedule, his or her  level of performance, and the geographic location of his or her  position. (See Sec. Sec. 537.108 and 537.109.) The service agreement  may address the possibility that, during the period the agreement is in  effect, the agency may modify the agreement to provide student loan  repayment benefits in addition to those fixed in the agreement based on  contingencies or conditions specified in the agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The minimum period of service to be established under a service  agreement is 3 years, regardless of the amount of student loan repayment  benefits authorized. The agency and the employee may mutually agree to  modify an existing service agreement, subject to the limitations at  Sec. 537.106(c)(2), to provide additional student loan repayment  benefits for additional service without the need for an entirely new  service agreement (which would require a new 3-year minimum service  period). Periods of leave without pay, or other periods during which the  employee is not in a pay status, do not count toward completion of the  required service period. Thus, the service completion date must be  extended by the total amount of time spent in non-pay status. However,  as provided by 5 CFR 353.107, absence because of uniformed service or  compensable injury is considered creditable toward the required service  period upon reemployment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A service agreement made under this part in no way constitutes a  promise of, or right or entitlement to, appointment, continued  employment, or noncompetitive conversion to the competitive service.  This condition should be stated in the service agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The service period begins on the date specified in the service  agreement. That beginning date may not be--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Earlier than the date the service agreement is signed; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Earlier than the date the individual begins serving in the  position for which he or she was recruited (when student loan repayment  benefits are approved to recruit a job candidate to fill an agency  position).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The service agreement must contain a provision addressing  whether the individual would be required to reimburse the paying agency  for student loan repayment benefits if he or she voluntarily separates  from the paying agency to work for another agency before the end of the  service period. (See Sec. 537.109(b)(2).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The agency may include in a service agreement specific  conditions (in addition to those required by law) that trigger the loss  of eligibility for student loan repayment benefits and/or a requirement  that the employee reimburse the agency for student loan repayment  benefits already received. (See Sec. Sec. 537.108(a)(3) and  537.109(a)(2).) However, a service agreement may not require  reimbursement based on--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An employee's failure to maintain performance at a particular  level (unless the employee is separated based on unacceptable  performance); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An involuntary separation for reasons other than misconduct,  unacceptable performance, or a negative suitability determination under  5 CFR part   731 (e.g., an involuntary separation resulting from a reduction in force  or medical reasons).</p>
