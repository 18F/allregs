The owner or operator shall comply with  this section no later than the compliance dates specified in the  referencing subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operated with the barrier fluid at a pressure that is greater  than the compressor stuffing box pressure at all times (except during  periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Equipped with a barrier fluid system degassing reservoir that is  routed to a process or fuel gas system or connected by a closed-vent  system to a control device that meets the requirements of either Sec.   63.1034 or Sec.  63.1021(b); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Equipped with a closed-loop system that purges the barrier fluid  directly into a process stream.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Barrier fluid system. The barrier fluid shall not be in light  liquid service. Each barrier fluid system shall be equipped with a  sensor that will detect failure of the seal system, barrier fluid  system, or both. Each sensor shall be observed daily or shall be  equipped with an alarm unless the compressor is located within the  boundary of an unmanned plant site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure criterion and leak detection. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator  shall determine, based on design considerations and operating  experience, a criterion that indicates failure of the seal system, the  barrier fluid system, or both. If the sensor indicates failure of the  seal system, the barrier fluid system, or both based on the criterion, a  leak is   detected and shall be repaired pursuant to Sec.  63.1024, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator shall keep records of the design criteria  and an explanation of the design criteria; and any changes to these  criteria and the reasons for the changes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Routed to a process or fuel gas system or equipped with a closed  vent system. A compressor is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs  (b) through (d) of this section if it is equipped with a system to  capture and transport leakage from the compressor drive shaft seal to a  process or a fuel gas system or to a closed vent system that captures  and transports leakage from the compressor to a control device meeting  the requirements of either Sec.  63.1034 or Sec.  63.1021(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Alternative compressor standard. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any compressor that is  designated, as described in Sec.  63.1022(e), as operating with an  instrument reading of less than 500 parts per million above background  shall operate at all times with an instrument reading of less than 500  parts per million. A compressor so designated is exempt from the  requirements of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section if the  compressor is demonstrated, initially upon designation, annually, and at  other times requested by the Administrator to be operating with an  instrument reading of less than 500 parts per million above background,  as measured by the method specified in Sec.  63.1023(b) and, as  applicable, Sec.  63.1023(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator shall record the dates and results of each  compliance test including the background level measured and the maximum  instrument reading measured during each compliance test.</p>
