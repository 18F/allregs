Requests for access should be acknowledged within 10 working days after receipt and provided access within 30 working days. Every effort will be made to provide access rapidly; however, records cannot usually be made available for review on the day of request. Requests must provide information needed to locate and identify the record, such as individual identifiers required by a particular system, to include the requester's full name and social security number.</p>
