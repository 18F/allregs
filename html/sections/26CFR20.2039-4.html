                                Sec. 20.2039-4  Lump sum distributions from ``qualified plans;''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>  taxation election described in paragraph (c) of this section. For  purposes of this section, an amount is payable as a lump sum  distribution under a plan if, as of the date the estate tax return is  filed (as determined under Sec. 20.2039-3(d)), it is payable as a lump  sum distribution at the election of the recipient or otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, Sec. 20.2039-2 shall apply with respect  to the annuity contract without regard to whether the recipient makes  the section 402(a)/403(a) taxation election with respect to the  remainder of the distribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recipient's section 402(a)/403(a) taxation election. The section  402(a)/403(a) taxation election is the election by the recipient of a  lump sum distribution to treat the distribution as--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1))</em>,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2))</em>, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A rollover contribution, in whole or in part, under section  402(a)(7) (relating to rollovers by a decedent's surviving spouse).  Accordingly, if a recipient makes the election, no portion of the  distribution is taxable to the recipient under the 10-year averaging  provisions of section 402(e) or as long-term capital gain under section  402(a)(2). However, a recipient's election under this paragraph (c) does  not preclude the application of section 402(e)(4)(J) to any securities  of the employer corporation included in the distribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Method of election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The recipient of a lump  sum distribution shall make the section 402(a)/403(a) taxation election  by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determining the income tax liability on the income tax return  (or amended return) for the taxable year of the distribution in a manner  consistent with paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Rolling over all or any part of the distribution under section  402(a)(7), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Filing a section 2039(f)(2) election statement described in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>  election statement may be filed at any time prior to making the election  under paragraph (d)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effect on estate tax return. If the date the estate tax return  is filed precedes the date on which the recipient makes the section  402(a)/403(a) taxation election with respect to a lump sum distribution,  the estate tax return may not reflect the election. However, if after  the estate tax return is filed, the recipient makes the section 402(a)/ 403(a) taxation election, the executor of the estate may file a claim  for refund or credit of an overpayment of the Federal estate tax within  the time prescribed in section 6511. See also, Sec. 20.6081-1 for rules  relating to obtaining an extension of time for filing the estate tax  return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Election irrevocable. If a recipient of a lump sum distribution  files a section 2039(f)(2) election statement, an income tax return (or  amended return) or makes a rollover contribution that constitutes the  section 402(a)/403(a) taxation election described in paragraphs (c) and  (d), the election may not be revoked. Accordingly, a subsequent and  amended income tax return filed by the recipient that is inconsistent  with the prior election will not be given effect for purposes of section  2039 and section 402 or 403.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Lump sum distribution to multiple recipients. In the case of a  lump sum distribution paid or payable under a qualified plan with  respect to the decedent to more than one recipient, the exclusion under  Sec. 20.2039-2 applies to so much of the distribution as is paid or  payable to a recipient who makes the section 402(a)/403(a) taxation  election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Distributions of annuity contracts included in multiple  distributions. Notwithstanding that a recipient makes the section  402(a)/403(a) taxation election with respect to a lump sum distribution  that includes the distribution of an annuity contract, the distribution  of the annuity contract is to be taken into account by the recipient for  purposes of the multiple distribution rules under section 402(e).
