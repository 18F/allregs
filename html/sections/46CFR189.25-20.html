The inspector shall determine if the  tests and inspections required by Sec. 196.15-60 of this subchapter  have been conducted. At each inspection for certification and periodic  inspection the inspector shall conduct the following tests and  inspections of fire-extinguishing equipment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>. In addition, the hand portable fire-extinguishers and  semiportable fire-extinguishing systems shall be examined for excessive  corrosion and general condition.</p><p class="depth3">Table 189.25-20(a)(1) ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Type unit                               Test ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Soda acid..............................
