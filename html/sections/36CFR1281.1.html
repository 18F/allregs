The Act requires the Archivist of the United States to promulgate architectural and design standards for new and existing Presidential libraries in order to ensure that such depositories preserve Presidential records subject to Chapter 22 of this title and papers and other historical materials accepted for deposit under section 2111 of this title and contain adequate research facilities. In addition the Archivist must submit a written report to the Congress before accepting new libraries or certain proposed physical or material changes or additions to an existing library; and to ensure, for existing libraries subject to the mandatory endowment requirement, that the endowment specified by 44 U.S.C. 2112(g) has

been transferred to the National Archives Trust Fund before acceptance by the Archivist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This part applies to design and construction of new libraries that are offered to NARA on or after July 17, 2008 and to material changes or additions to new and existing libraries funded wholly by gift on or after that date.</p>
