At the Director's discretion, the Director may approve, in consultation  with EPA, an alternative post-injection site care timeframe other than  the 50 year default, if an owner or operator can demonstrate during the  permitting process that an alternative post-injection site care  timeframe is appropriate and ensures non-endangerment of USDWs. The  demonstration must be based on significant, site-specific data and  information including all data and information collected pursuant to  Sec. Sec.  146.82 and 146.83, and must contain substantial evidence that  the geologic sequestration project will no longer pose a risk of  endangerment to USDWs at the end of the alternative post-injection site  care timeframe.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A demonstration of an alternative post-injection site care  timeframe must include consideration and documentation of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The results of computational modeling performed pursuant to  delineation of the area of review under Sec.  146.84;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The predicted timeframe for pressure decline within the  injection zone, and any other zones, such that formation fluids may not  be forced into any USDWs; and/or the timeframe for pressure decline to  pre-injection pressures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The predicted rate of carbon dioxide plume migration within  the injection zone, and the predicted timeframe for the cessation of  migration;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A description of the site-specific processes that will result  in carbon dioxide trapping including immobilization by capillary  trapping, dissolution, and mineralization at the site;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The predicted rate of carbon dioxide trapping in the immobile  capillary phase, dissolved phase, and/or mineral phase;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The results of laboratory analyses, research studies, and/or  field or site-specific studies to verify the information required in  paragraphs (iv) and (v) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A characterization of the confining zone(s) including a  demonstration that it is free of transmissive faults, fractures, and  micro-fractures and of appropriate thickness, permeability, and  integrity to impede fluid (e.g., carbon dioxide, formation fluids)  movement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The presence of potential conduits for fluid movement  including planned injection wells and project monitoring wells  associated with the proposed geologic sequestration project or any other  projects in proximity to the predicted/modeled, final extent of the  carbon dioxide plume and area of elevated pressure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> A description of the well construction and an assessment of the  quality of plugs of all abandoned wells within the area of review;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> The distance between the injection zone and the nearest USDWs  above and/or below the injection zone; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Any additional site-specific factors required by the Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information submitted to support the demonstration in paragraph  (c)(1) of this section must meet the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All analyses and tests performed to support the demonstration  must be accurate, reproducible, and performed in accordance with the  established quality assurance standards;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Estimation techniques must be appropriate and EPA-certified  test protocols must be used where available;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Predictive models must be appropriate and tailored to the site  conditions, composition of the carbon dioxide stream and injection and  site conditions over the life of the geologic sequestration project;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Predictive models must be calibrated using existing information  (e.g., at Class I, Class II, or Class V experimental technology well  sites) where sufficient data are available;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Reasonably conservative values and modeling assumptions must be  used and disclosed to the Director whenever values are estimated on the  basis of known, historical information instead of site-specific  measurements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> An analysis must be performed to identify and assess aspects of  the alternative post-injection site care timeframe demonstration that  contribute significantly to uncertainty.
