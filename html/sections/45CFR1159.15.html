                            <p class="depth0">The Deputy Chairman for Management and Budget has the responsibility  of maintaining adequate technical, physical, and security safeguards to  prevent unauthorized disclosure or destruction of manual and automatic  record systems. These security safeguards shall apply to all systems in  which identifiable personal data are processed or maintained, including  all reports and outputs from such systems that contain identifiable  personal information. Such safeguards must be sufficient to prevent  negligent, accidental, or unintentional disclosure, modification or  destruction of any personal records or data, and must furthermore  minimize, to the extent practicable, the risk that skilled technicians  or knowledgeable persons could improperly obtain access to modify or  destroy such records or data and shall further insure against such  casual entry by unskilled persons without official reasons for access to  such records or data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manual systems. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records contained in a system of records as  defined herein may be used, held or stored only where facilities are  adequate to prevent unauthorized access by persons within or outside the  Endowment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All records, when not under the personal control of the  employees authorized to use the records, must be stored in a locked  metal filing cabinet. Some systems of records are not of such  confidential nature that their disclosure would constitute a harm to an  individual who is the subject of such record. However, records in this  category shall also be maintained in locked metal filing cabinets or  maintained in a secured room with a locking door.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Access to and use of a system of records shall be permitted only  to persons whose duties require such access within the Endowment, for  routine uses as defined in Sec. 1159.1 as to any given system, or for  such other uses as may be provided herein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other than for access within the Endowment to persons needing  such records in the performance of their official duties or routine uses  as defined in Sec. 1159.1, or such other uses as provided herein,  access to records within a system of records shall be permitted only to  the individual to whom the record pertains or upon his or her written  request to the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Access to areas where a system of records is stored will be  limited to   those persons whose duties require work in such areas. There shall be an  accounting of the removal of any records from such storage areas  utilizing a written log, as directed by the Deputy Chairman for  Management and Budget. The written log shall be maintained at all times.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Endowment shall ensure that all persons whose duties require  access to and use of records contained in a system of records are  adequately trained to protect the security and privacy of such records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The disposal and destruction of records within a system of  records shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by the General  Services Administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Automated systems. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identifiable personal information may be  processed, stored or maintained by automated data systems only where  facilities or conditions are adequate to prevent unauthorized access to  such systems in any form. Whenever such data, whether contained in punch  cards, magnetic tapes or discs, are not under the personal control of an  authorized person, such information must be stored in a locked or  secured room, or in such other facility having greater safeguards than  those provided for herein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Access to and use of identifiable personal data associated with  automated data systems shall be limited to those persons whose duties  require such access. Proper control of personal data in any form  associated with automated data systems shall be maintained at all times,  including maintenance of accountability records showing disposition of  input and output documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All persons whose duties require access to processing and  maintenance of identifiable personal data and automated systems shall be  adequately trained in the security and privacy of personal data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The disposal and disposition of identifiable personal data and  automated systems shall be done by shredding, burning or in the case of  tapes or discs, degaussing, in accordance with any regulations now or  hereafter proposed by the General Services Administration or other  appropriate authority.</p>
