                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The regulations in Sec. Sec. 1301.11 to 1301.24 implement  section 3 of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, with respect to  systems of records maintained by TVA. They provide procedures by which  an individual may exercise the rights granted by the Act to determine  whether a TVA system contains a record pertaining to him; to gain access  to such records; to have a copy made of all or any portion thereof; and  to request administrative correction or amendment of such records. They  prescribe fees to be charged for copying records; establish  identification requirements; list penalties provided by statute for  certain violations of the Act; and establish exemptions from certain  requirements of the Act for certain TVA systems or components thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nothing in Sec. Sec. 1301.11 to 1301.24 entitles an individual  to any access to any information or record compiled in reasonable  anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certain records of which TVA may have physical possession are  the official records of another government agency which exercises  dominion and control over the records, their content, and access  thereto. In such cases, TVA's maintenance of the records is subject to  the direction of the other government agency. Except for a request for a  determination of the existence of the record, when TVA receives requests  related to these records, TVA will immediately refer the request to the  controlling agency for all decisions regarding the request, and will  notify the individual making the request of the referral.</p>
