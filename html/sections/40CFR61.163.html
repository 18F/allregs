Verification of operational status shall, at  a minimum, consist of an evaluation of the monitoring system in  accordance with the requirements and procedures contained in Performance  Specification 1 of appendix B of 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> During the emission test required in Sec. 61.164(a) each owner  or operator subject to paragraph (a) of this section shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct continuous opacity monitoring from the beginning of the  first test run until the completion of the third test run. Process and  control equipment shall be operated in a manner that will minimize  opacity of emissions, subject to the Administrator's approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculate 6-minute opacity averages from 24 or more data points  equally spaced over each 6-minute period during the test runs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determine, based on the 6-minute opacity averages, the opacity  value corresponding to the 99 percent upper confidence level of a normal  or log-normal (whichever the owner or operator determines is more  representative) distribution of the average opacity values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Conduct continuous monitoring of the temperature of the gas  entering the control device from the beginning of the first test run  until completion of the third test run.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Calculate 15-minute averages of the temperature of the gas  entering the control device during each test run.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An owner or operator may redetermine the values described in  paragraph (c) of this section during any emission test that demonstrates  compliance with the emission limits in Sec. 61.162(a)(2) or  Sec. 61.162(b)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The requirements of Sec. 60.13(d) and Sec. 60.13(f) shall apply  to an owner or operator subject to paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Except for system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and  zero and span adjustments required under Sec. 60.13(d), all continuous  monitoring systems shall be in continuous operation and shall meet  minimum frequency of operation requirements by completing a minimum of  one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10-second period  and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An owner or operator subject to paragraph (a) of this section  shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reduce all opacity data to 6-minute averages. Six-minute  averages shall be calculated from 24 or more data points equally spaced  over each 6-minute period. Data recorded during periods of monitoring  system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span  adjustments shall not be included in the data averages calculated under  this paragraph, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculate 15-minute averages of the temperature of the gas  entering the control device for each 15-minute operating period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> After receipt and consideration of written application, the  Administrator may approve alternative monitoring systems for the  measurement of one or more process or operating parameters that is or  are demonstrated to enable   accurate and representative monitoring of a properly operating control  device. Upon approval of an alternative monitoring system for an  affected source, the Administrator will specify requirements to replace  the requirements of paragraphs (a)-(g) of this section for that system.
