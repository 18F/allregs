                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and (b). Determine combined fuel economy  values as described in Sec. 600.210-12(c). Note that the label for plug- in hybrid electric vehicles requires separate values for combined fuel  economy for vehicle operation before and after the vehicle's battery is  fully discharged; we generally refer to these modes as ``Blended  Electric+Gas'' (or ``Electric Only'', as applicable) and ``Gas only''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> CO2 emission rate. Determine the engine-related CO2  emission rate as described in Sec. 600.210-12(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fuel consumption rate. Calculate the fuel consumption rate as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For vehicles with engines that are not plug-in hybrid electric  vehicles, calculate the fuel consumption rate in gallons per 100 miles  (or gasoline gallon equivalent per 100 miles for fuels other than  gasoline or diesel fuel) with the following formula, rounded to the  first decimal place:  Fuel Consumption Rate = 100/MPG  Where:  MPG = The value for combined fuel economy from Sec. 600.210-12(c),</p><p class="depth3">rounded to the nearest whole mpg.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, calculate two separate  fuel consumption rates as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Calculate the fuel consumption rate based on engine operation  after the battery is fully discharged as described in paragraph (c)(1)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate the fuel consumption rate during operation before the  battery is fully discharged in kW-hours per 100 miles as described in  SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 600.011), as described in  Sec. 600.116.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For electric vehicles, calculate the fuel consumption rate in  kW-hours   per 100 miles with the following formula, rounded to the nearest whole  number:   Fuel Consumption Rate = 100/MPG  Where:  MPG = The combined fuel economy value from paragraph (a) of this</p><p class="depth3">section, in miles per kW-hour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, calculate the fuel consumption  rate in kilograms of hydrogen per 100 miles with the following formula,  rounded to the nearest whole number:   Fuel Consumption Rate = 100/MPG  Where:  MPG = The combined fuel economy value from paragraph (a) of this</p><p class="depth3">section, in miles per kilogram of hydrogen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fuel economy and greenhouse gas ratings. Determine a vehicle's  fuel economy and greenhouse gas ratings as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For gasoline-fueled vehicles that are not plug-in hybrid  electric vehicles (including flexible fuel vehicles that operate on  gasoline), establish a single rating based only on the vehicle's  combined fuel economy from paragraph (a) of this section. For all other  vehicles, establish a fuel economy rating based on the vehicle's  combined fuel economy and establish a separate greenhouse gas rating  based on combined CO2 emission rates from paragraph (b) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We will establish the fuel economy rating based on fuel  consumption values specified in paragraph (c) of this section. We will  establish the value dividing the 5 and 6 ratings based on the fuel  consumption corresponding to the projected achieved Corporate Average  Fuel Economy level for the applicable model year. This is intended to  prevent below-average vehicles from getting an above-average fuel  economy rating for the label. We will establish the remaining cutpoints  based on a statistical evaluation of available information from the  certification database for all model types. Specifically, the mean value  plus two standard deviations will define the point between the 1 and 2  ratings. The mean value minus two standard deviations will define the  point between the 9 and 10 ratings. The 1 rating will apply for any  vehicle with higher fuel consumption rates than the 2 rating; similarly,  the 10 rating will apply for any vehicle with lower fuel consumption  rates than the 9 rating. We will calculate range values for the  remaining intermediate ratings by dividing the range into equal  intervals. We will convert the resulting range intervals to equivalent  miles-per-gallon values. We will define the greenhouse gas ratings by  converting the values from the fuel economy rating intervals to  equivalent CO2 emission rates using the conventional  conversion factor for gasoline (8887 g CO2 per gallon of  consumed fuel).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Annual fuel cost. Calculate annual fuel costs as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section,  calculate the total annual fuel cost with the following formula, rounded  to nearest $50:   Annual Fuel Cost = Fuel Price/MPG x Average Annual Miles  Where:  Fuel Price = The estimated fuel price provided by EPA for the type of</p><p class="depth3">fuel required for the vehicle. The units are dollars per</p><p class="depth3">gallon for gasoline and diesel fuel, dollars per gasoline</p><p class="depth3">gallon equivalent for natural gas, dollars per kW-hr for plug-</p><p class="depth3">in electricity, and dollars per kilogram of hydrogen for</p><p class="depth3">hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. MPG = The combined fuel economy value from paragraph (a) of this</p><p class="depth3">section. The units are miles per gallon for gasoline and</p><p class="depth3">diesel fuel, miles per gasoline gallon equivalent for natural</p><p class="depth3">gas, miles per kW-hr for plug-in electricity, and miles per</p><p class="depth3">kilogram of hydrogen for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Average Annual Miles = The estimated annual mileage figure provided by</p><p class="depth3">EPA, in miles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For dual fuel vehicles and flexible fuel vehicles, disregard  operation on the alternative fuel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>. This description applies for  vehicles whose engine starts only after the battery is fully discharged.  Use good engineering judgment to extrapolate this for calculating annual  fuel cost for vehicles that use combined power from the battery and the  engine before the battery is fully discharged. Calculate annual fuel  cost as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section. Adjust  each of these values for 5-cycle operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate multi-day individual utility factors (UF) as  described in Sec. 600.116 corresponding to the driving ranges from  paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Calculate a composite $/mile value for city driving using the  following equation:   $/mile = $/mileCD x UF + $/mileCS x (1-UF)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Repeat the calculation in paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section  for highway driving.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Calculate the annual fuel cost based on the combined values  for city and highway driving using the following equation:  Annual fuel cost = ($/milecity x 0.55 + $/milehwy x 0.45) x Average  Annual Miles</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Round the annual fuel cost to the nearest $50 by dividing the  unrounded annual fuel cost by 50, then rounding the result to the  nearest whole number, then multiplying this rounded result by 50 to  determine the annual fuel cost to be used for purposes of labeling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fuel savings. Calculate an estimated five-year cost increment  relative to an average vehicle by multiplying the annual fuel cost from  paragraph (e) of this section by 5 and subtracting this value from the  average five-year fuel cost. We will calculate the average five-year  fuel cost from the annual fuel cost equation in paragraph (e) of this  section based on a gasoline-fueled vehicle with a mean fuel economy  value, consistent with the value dividing the 5 and 6 ratings under  paragraph (d) of this section. The average five-year fuel cost for model  year 2012 is $12,600 for a 22-mpg vehicle that drives 15,000 miles per  year with gasoline priced at $3.70 per gallon. We may periodically  update this five year reference fuel cost for later model years to  better characterize the fuel economy for an average vehicle. Round the  calculated five-year cost increment to the nearest $50. Negative values  represent a cost increase compared to the average vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Smog rating. Establish a rating for exhaust emissions other than  CO2 based on the applicable emission standards for the  appropriate model year as shown in Tables 1 through 3 of this section.  For Independent Commercial Importers that import vehicles not subject to  Tier 2 or Tier 3 emission standards, the vehicle's smog rating is 1.  Similarly, if a manufacturer certifies vehicles to emission standards  that are less stringent than all the identified standards for any  reason, the vehicle's smog rating is 1. If EPA or California emission  standards change in the future, we may revise the emission levels  corresponding to each rating for future model years as appropriate to  reflect the changed standards. If this occurs, we would publish the  revised ratings as described in Sec. 600.302-12(k), allowing sufficient  lead time to make the changes; we would also expect to initiate a  rulemaking to update the smog rating in the regulation.</p><p class="depth2">Table 1 of Sec.  600.311-12--Criteria for Establishing Smog Rating for Model Year 2025 and Later ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">U.S. EPA Tier 3 Emission       California Air Resources Board LEV III</p><p class="depth2">Rating                          Standard                          Emission Standard ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1..................................

We  will determine the range of combined fuel economy and CO2  emission values for each vehicle class identified in Sec. 600.315. We  will generally update these range values before the start of each model  year based on the lowest and highest values within each vehicle class.  We will also use this same information to establish a range of fuel  economy values for all vehicles. Continue to use the most recently  published numbers until we update them, even if you start a new model  year before we publish the range values for the new model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Driving range. Determine the driving range for certain vehicles  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For vehicles operating on nonpressurized liquid fuels, determine  the vehicle's driving range in miles by multiplying the combined fuel  economy described in paragraph (a) of this section by the vehicle's  usable fuel storage capacity, rounded to the nearest whole number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For electric vehicles, determine the vehicle's overall driving  range as described in Section 8 of SAE J1634 (incorporated by reference  in Sec. 600.011), as described in Sec. 600.116. Determine separate range  values for FTP-based city and HFET-based highway driving, then calculate  a combined value by   arithmetically averaging the two values, weighted 0.55 and 0.45  respectively, and rounding to the nearest whole number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For natural gas vehicles, determine the vehicle's driving range  in miles by multiplying the combined fuel economy described in paragraph  (a) of this section by the vehicle's usable fuel storage capacity  (expressed in gasoline gallon equivalents), rounded to the nearest whole  number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, determine the battery  driving range and overall driving range as described in SAE J1711  (incorporated by reference in Sec. 600.011), as described in  Sec. 600.116, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the vehicle's Actual Charge-Depleting Range,  Rcda. Determine separate range values for FTP-based city and  HFET-based highway driving, then calculate a combined value by  arithmetically averaging the two values, weighted 0.55 and 0.45  respectively, and rounding to the nearest whole number. Precondition the  vehicle as needed to minimize engine operation for consuming stored fuel  vapors in evaporative canisters; for example, you may purge the  evaporative canister or time a refueling event to avoid engine starting  related to purging the canister. For vehicles that use combined power  from the battery and the engine before the battery is fully discharged,  also use this procedure to establish an all electric range by  determining the distance the vehicle drives before the engine starts,  rounded to the nearest mile. You may represent this as a range of  values. We may approve adjustments to these procedures if they are  necessary to properly characterize a vehicle's all electric range.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use good engineering judgment to calculate the vehicle's  operating distance before the fuel tank is empty when starting with a  full fuel tank and a fully charged battery, consistent with the  procedure and calculation specified in this paragraph (j), rounded to  the nearest 10 miles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, determine the vehicle's driving  range in miles by multiplying the combined fuel economy described in  paragraph (a) of this section by the vehicle's usable fuel storage  capacity (expressed in kilograms of hydrogen), rounded to the nearest  whole number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Charge time. For electric vehicles, determine the time it takes  to fully charge the battery from a 240 volt power source to the point  that the battery meets the manufacturer's end-of-charge criteria,  consistent with the procedures specified in SAE J1634 (incorporated by  reference in Sec. 600.011) for electric vehicles and in SAE J1711  (incorporated by reference in Sec. 600.011) for plug-in hybrid electric  vehicles, as described in Sec. 600.116. This value may be more or less  than the 12-hour minimum charging time specified for testing. You must  alternatively specify the charge time based on a standard 120 volt power  source if the vehicle cannot be charged at the higher voltage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> California-specific values. If the Administrator determines that  automobiles intended for sale in California are likely to exhibit  significant differences in fuel economy or other label values from those  intended for sale in other states, the Administrator will compute  separate values for each class of automobiles for California and for the  other states.
