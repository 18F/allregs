                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Board will charge the requester fees for services  provided in processing requests for information. Those fees will be  charged according to the schedule in paragraph (d) of this section, and  will recover the full allowable direct costs that the Board incurs. Fees  may be charged for time spent searching for information, even if the  Board fails to locate responsive records, and even if it determines that  the information is exempt from disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term direct costs means the costs to an  agency for   searching for and copying (and in the case of commercial requesters,  reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include,  for example, the salary of each employee performing work at the rate of  $5 per quarter hour. Overhead expenses, such as costs of space and of  heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored, are  not included in direct costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term search, as defined by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3)(D), means  either manual or automated review of Board records to locate those  records asked for, and includes all time spent looking for material in  response to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line  identification of material within documents. Searches will be done in  the most efficient and least expensive way to limit costs for both the  Board and the requester. Searches may be done manually or by computer  using existing programming. The Board will make a reasonable effort to  search for the records in electronic form or format, except when such  effort would interfere to a large extent with the operation of the  Board's automated information system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term duplication means the process of copying a document or  electronically maintained information in response to a FOIA request.  Copies can take the form of paper, microfilm, audio-visual materials, or  machine-readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among  others. The copy provided will be in a form or format requested if the  record is readily reproducible by the Board in that form or format. The  Board will make a reasonable effort to maintain its records in forms or  formats that are reproducible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The term review includes the process of examining documents to  determine whether any portion of them may be exempt from disclosure  under the FOIA, when the documents have been located in response to a  request that is for a commercial use. The term also includes processing  any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to edit  them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include  time spent resolving general legal or policy issues.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The term commercial use request means a request from or on  behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers  the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the  person on whose behalf the request is made. In deciding whether a  requester properly belongs in this category, the Board will decide the  use the requester will make of the documents requested. Also, where the  Board has reasonable cause to doubt the use a requester will make of the  records requested, or where that use is not clear from the request, the  Board will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to  a specific category.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The term educational institution means a preschool, a public or  private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate  higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an  institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational  education that operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The term noncommercial scientific institution means an  institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term  is used above, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting  scientific research whose results are not intended to promote any  particular product or industry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The term representative of the news media means any person  actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to  publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information  that concerns current events or that would be of current interest to the  public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Categories of requesters. There are four categories of FOIA  requesters: Commercial use requesters; educational and noncommercial  scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all  other requesters. To be included in the category of educational and  noncommercial scientific institutions, requesters must show that the  request is authorized by a qualifying institution and that they are  seeking the records not for a commercial use, but to further scholarly  or scientific research. To be included in the news media category, a  requester must meet the definition in paragraph (b)(8)   of this section and the request must not be made for a commercial use.  To avoid commercial use charges, requesters must show that they should  be included in a category or categories other than that of commercial  use requesters. The Board will decide the categories to place requesters  for fee purposes. It will make these determinations based on information  given by the requesters and information otherwise known to the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Board will not charge a requester if the fee for any request  is less that $100 (the cost to the Board of processing and collecting  the fee).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the Board receives a request:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> From a commercial use requester, it will charge fees that  recover the full direct costs for searching for the information  requested, reviewing it for release at the initial request stage,  reviewing it after an appeal to determine whether other exemptions not  considered before the appeal apply to it, and copying it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> From an educational and noncommercial scientific institution  or, to the extent copying exceeds 100 pages, from a representative of  the news media, it will charge fees only for the cost of copying the  requested information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> From all other requesters, to the extent copying exceeds 100  pages and search time exceeds 2 hours, it will charge fees for the full  direct cost of searching for and copying requested records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the Board reasonably believes that a requester or group of  requesters is attempting to divide a request into more than one request  to avoid payment of fees, the Board will combine the requests and charge  fees accordingly. The Board will not combine multiple requests on  unrelated subjects from one requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the Board decides that charges for a request are likely to  exceed $250, the Board will require the requester to pay the entire fee  in advance before continuing to process the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a requester has an outstanding fee charge or has not paid a  fee on time, the Board will require the requester to pay the full amount  of the estimated fee in advance before the Board begins to process a new  or pending request from that requester, and before it applies  administrative time limits for making a decision on the new or pending  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fee schedule. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fees for document searches for records will be  charged at a rate of $5 per quarter hour spent by each Board employee  performing the search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fees for computer searches for records will be $5 per quarter  hour spent by each employee operating the computer equipment and/or  developing a new inquiry or report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fees for review at the initial administrative level to determine  whether records or portions of records are exempt from disclosure, and  for review after an appeal to determine whether the records are exempt  on other legal grounds, will be charged, for commercial use requests, at  a rate of $5 per quarter hour spent by each reviewing employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fees for photocopying records is 20 cents a page, the fee for  copying audio tapes is the direct cost up to $15 per cassette tape; the  fee for copying video tapes is the direct cost up to $20 per tape; and  the fee for computer printouts is 10 cents a page. The fee for  duplication of electronically maintained information in the requester's  preferred format will be $21 for copying computer tapes and $4 for  copying records on computer diskettes, if it is feasible for the Board  to reproduce records in the format requested. Fees for certified copies  of the Board's records will include a $4 per page charge for each page  displaying the Board's seal and certification. When the Board estimates  that copying costs will exceed $100, it will notify the requester of the  estimated amount unless the requester has indicated in advance a  willingness to pay an equal or higher amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fee waivers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon request, the Clerk of the Board, Regional  Director, or Chief Administrative Judge, as appropriate, will furnish  information without charge or at reduced rates if it is established that  disclosure ``is in the public interest because it is likely to   contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or  activities of the government.'' This decision will be based on:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested  records concerns the operations or activities of the government;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The informative value of the information to be disclosed:  Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of  government operations or activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether disclosure of the requested information is likely to  contribute to public understanding of the subject of the disclosure; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The significance of the contribution the disclosure would make  to public understanding of government operations or activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If information is to be furnished without charge or at reduced  rates, the requester must also establish that disclosure of the  information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the  requester. This decision will be based on:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be  furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the identified commercial interest of the requester is  sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in  disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of  the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The requester must establish eligibility for a waiver of fees or  for reduced fees. The denial of a request for waiver of fees may be  appealed under subpart C of this part.</p>
