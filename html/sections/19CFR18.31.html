                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Merchandise may be transported by pipeline under the  procedures in this part, as appropriate and unless otherwise  specifically provided for in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bill of lading to account for merchandise. Unless Customs has  reasonable cause to suspect fraud, Customs shall accept a bill of lading  or equivalent document of receipt issued by the pipeline operator to the  shipper and accepted by the consignee to account for the quantity of  merchandise transported by pipeline and to maintain the identity of the  merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures when pipeline is only carrier. When a pipeline is the  only carrier of bonded merchandise and there is no transfer to another  carrier, the bill of lading or equivalent document of receipt issued by  the pipeline operator to the shipper shall be included with, and made a  part of, the Customs in-bond document (see Sec. 18.2(b)). If there are  no discrepancies between the bill of lading or equivalent document of  receipt and the other documents making up the in-bond manifest for the  merchandise, and provided that Customs has no reasonable cause to  suspect fraud, the bill of lading or equivalent document of receipt  shall be accepted by Customs at the port of destination or exportation  (see Sec. Sec. 18.2(d) and 18.7) as establishing the quantity and  identity of the merchandise transported. The pipeline operator shall be  responsible for any discrepancies, including shortages, irregular  deliveries, or nondeliveries at the port of destination or exportation  (see Sec. 18.8).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures when there is more than one carrier (i.e., transfer  of the merchandise)--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pipeline as initial carrier. When a pipeline is  the initial carrier of bonded merchandise and the merchandise is  transferred to another conveyance (either a different mode of  transportation   or a pipeline operated by another operator), the procedures in Sec.  18.3 and paragraph (c) of this section shall be followed, except that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the merchandise is to be transferred to one conveyance, a  copy of the bill of lading or equivalent document issued by the pipeline  operator to the shipper shall be delivered to the person in charge of  the conveyance for delivery, along with the in-bond document, to the  appropriate Customs official at the port of destination or exportation;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the merchandise is to be transferred to more than one  conveyance, a copy of the bill of lading or equivalent document issued  by the pipeline operator to the shipper shall be delivered to the person  in charge of each additional conveyance, along with the two additional  copies of the in-bond document, for delivery to the appropriate Customs  official at the port of destination or exportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transfer to pipeline from initial carrier other than a pipeline.  When bonded merchandise initially transported by a carrier other than a  pipeline is transferred to a pipeline, the procedures in Sec. 18.3 and  paragraph (c) of this section shall be followed, except that the bill of  lading or other equivalent document of receipt issued by the pipeline  operator to the shipper shall be delivered, along with the in-bond  document, to the appropriate Customs officer at the port of destination  or exportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Initial carrier liable for discrepancies. In the case of either  paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, the initial carrier shall be  responsible for any discrepancies, including shortages, irregular  deliveries, or nondeliveries, at the port of destination or exportation  (see Sec. 18.8).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recordkeeping. The shipper, pipeline operator, and consignee are  subject to the recordkeeping requirements in 19 U.S.C. 1508 and 1509, as  provided for in part 162 of this chapter.
