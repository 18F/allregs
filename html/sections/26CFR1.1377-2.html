1362(a) had terminated for a previous taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special rules for post-termination transition period. Pursuant to section 1377(b)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a post-termination transition period arises the day after the last day that an S corporation was in existence if a C corporation acquires the assets of the S corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a)(2) applies. However, if an S corporation acquires the assets of another S corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a)(2) applies, a post-termination transition period does not arise. (See Sec. 1.1368-2(d)(2) for the treatment of the acquisition of the assets of an S corporation by another S corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a)(2) applies.) The special treatment under section 1371(e)(1) of distributions of money by a corporation with respect to its stock during the post-termination transition period is available only to those shareholders who were shareholders in the S corporation at the time of the termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination defined.

A determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section becomes effective on the date prescribed in section 1313 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determination under section 1313(a). A determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section becomes effective on the date prescribed in section 1313 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Written agreement. A determination under paragraph (c)(2) of this section becomes effective when it is signed by the district director having jurisdiction over the corporation (or by another Service official to whom authority to sign the agreement is delegated) and by an officer of the corporation authorized to sign on its behalf. Neither the request for a written agreement nor the terms of the written agreement suspend the running of any statute of limitations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Implied agreement. A determination under paragraph (c) (3) or (4) of this section becomes effective on the day after the date of expiration of the period specified under section 6226 or 6213, respectively.
