These conditions must be demonstrated with the available air bleed for icing protection at its critical condition, without adverse effect, followed by an acceleration to takeoff power or thrust in accordance with the procedures defined in the airplane flight manual. During the idle operation, the engine may be run up periodically to a moderate power or thrust setting in a manner acceptable to the Administrator. Analysis may be used to show ambient temperatures below the tested temperature are less critical. The applicant must document the engine run-up procedure (including the maximum time interval between run-ups from idle, run-up power setting, and duration at power), the associated minimum ambient temperature, and the maximum time interval. These conditions must be used in the analysis that establishes the airplane operating limitations in accordance with Sec. 25.1521.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For the purposes of this section, the icing conditions defined in appendix O of this part, including the conditions specified in Condition 3 of Table 1 of this section, are not applicable to airplanes with a maximum takeoff weight equal to or greater than 60,000 pounds.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Icing Conditions for Ground Tests--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Water concentration       Mean effective particle</p><p class="depth0">Condition                      Total air temperature               (minimum)                    diameter                 Demonstration--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.
