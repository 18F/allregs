                            <p class="depth0">Fabricated components which are not products of the United States  are excluded from the exemption. In addition, the exemption is not  applicable to any component exported from the Customs territory of the  United States:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> From continuous Customs custody with remission, abatement, or  refund of duty;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With benefit of drawback;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To comply with any law of the United States or regulation of any  Federal agency requiring exportation; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After manufacture or production in the United States under  subheading 9813.00.05, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202).</p><p class="depth2">Example. Partially completed components of an electric motor are  imported in several separate shipments and are entered under a temporary  importation bond to be manufactured into finished motors under the  provisions of subheading 9813.00.05, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202). The  components are completed and assembled into finished electric motors.  The finished motors are exported and are assembled abroad into electric  fans which are subsequently imported into the United States.  Irrespective of the fact that the assembly of the motors might involve  such a substantial change that the motor could be considered a product  of the United States, no exemption may be given for the value of the   electric motors, since they were exported after manufacture or  production in the United States under the provision of subheading  9813.00.05, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202).
