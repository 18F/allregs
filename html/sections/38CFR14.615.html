Section 515(b), title 38 U.S.C., provides that the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs may pay tort claims, in the manner  authorized in the first paragraph of section 2672 of title 28 U.S.C.,  when such claims arise in foreign countries in connection with  Department of Veterans Affairs operations abroad.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Action by claimant. Claims for property loss or damage may be  filed by the owner of the property or his or her duly authorized agent  or legal representative. If the property was insured and the insurer is  subrogated, in whole or in part, and if both the owner and the insurer  desire to file a claim for their respective losses they should join in  one claim. Claims for personal injury may be filed by the injured person  or his or her agent or legal representative. Claims for death may be  filed by the personal representative of the decedent or any other  legally qualified person. When filed by an agent or legal  representative, the claim must show the title or capacity of the person  representing the claimant and be accompanied by evidence of the  appointment of such person as agent, legal representative, executor/ executrix, administrator/administratrix, guardian, or other fiduciary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time for filing. A claim may not be allowed under 38 U.S.C.  515(b) unless it is presented to the Secretary or his or her designee  within 2 years after the claim accrues.
