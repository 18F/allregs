                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except for compulsory vessels, each ship radiotelephone station  licensed to operate in the band 1605-3500 kHz must be able to receive  and transmit J3E emission on the frequency 2182 kHz. Ship stations are  additionally authorized to receive and transmit H3E emission for  communications with foreign coast stations and with vessels of foreign  registry. If the station is used for other than safety communications,  it must be capable also of receiving and transmitting the J3E emission  on at least two other frequencies in that band. However, ship stations  which operate exclusively on the Mississippi River and its connecting  waterways, and on high frequency bands above 3500 kHz, need be equipped  with 2182 kHz and one other frequency within the band 1605-3500 kHz.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, at least  one VHF radiotelephone transmitter/receiver must be able to transmit and  receive on the following frequencies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The distress, safety and calling frequency 156.800 MHz;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The primary intership safety frequency 156.300 MHz;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> One or more working frequencies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All other frequencies necessary for its service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a ship ordinarily has no requirement for VHF  communications, handheld VHF equipment may be used solely to comply with  the bridge-to-bridge navigational communication requirements contained  in subpart U of this part.
