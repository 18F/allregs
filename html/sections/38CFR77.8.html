                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application for grants. An applicant may submit, on or before  the submission deadline date established in a NOFA, an application in  accordance with the instructions in the NOFA and including the forms  specified in the NOFA. Such application must be signed by the applicant  or an official or representative of the applicant duly authorized to  make such application and to assume on behalf of the applicant the  obligations imposed by law, applicable regulations, and any additional  terms and conditions of the grant. VA may require in the NOFA for  applicants to submit a pre-application for review and approval prior to  the submission of an application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Partnerships. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligible entities may enter into partnerships  with other eligible entities, including those in other States, and  submit joint applications for adaptive sports grants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A joint application made by two or more applicants may have  separate budgets corresponding to the programs, services and activities  performed by each of the joint applicants or may have a combined budget.  If a joint application presents separate budgets, VA may make separate  awards, or may award a single award authorizing separate amounts for  each joint applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evaluation of applications submitted. All applications submitted  shall be evaluated. After the initial internal or peer review,  additional internal evaluations and/or peer reviews may be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicant's performance on prior award. When the applicant has  previously received an award from VA or another Federal agency, the  applicant's noncompliance with requirements applicable to such prior  award as reflected in past written evaluation reports and memoranda on  performance, and the completeness of required prior submissions, may be  considered by VA. In any case where VA proposes to deny a grant based  upon the applicant's noncompliance with requirements applicable to the  prior award, VA shall do so only after affording the applicant notice  and a reasonable opportunity to rebut the proposed basis for denial of a  grant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applicant's fiscal integrity. Applicants must meet and maintain  standards of fiscal integrity for participation in Federal grant  programs as reflected in 2 CFR part 200.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disposition of applications. Upon review of an application and  dependent on availability of funds, VA will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approve the application for funding, in whole or in part, for  such amount of funds, and subject to such conditions that VA deems  necessary or desirable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine that the application is of acceptable quality for  funding, in that it meets minimum criteria, but disapprove the  application for funding because it did not rank sufficiently high in  relation to other applications to qualify for an award based on the  level of funding available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disapprove the application for failure to meet the applicable  selection criteria at a sufficiently high level in comparison to other  applications to justify an award of funds, or for another reason as  provided in the documentation of the decision; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Defer action on the application for such reasons as lack of  funds or a need for further review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notification of disposition. VA will notify the applicant in  writing of the disposition of the application. A signed grant agreement  form will be issued to the applicant of an approved application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Availability of grant funds. Federal financial assistance is  normally available only with respect to obligations incurred subsequent  to the effective date of the grant. The effective date of grant will be  set forth in the grant agreement. Recipients may be reimbursed for costs  resulting from obligations incurred before the effective date of the  grant, if such costs are authorized by VA in the NOFA, the grant  agreement or subsequently by VA in writing, and otherwise would be  allowable as costs of the grant under applicable guidelines,  regulations, and terms and conditions of the grant agreement.
