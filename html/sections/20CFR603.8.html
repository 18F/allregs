                                Sec. 603.8  What are the requirements for payment of costs and program
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section,  grant funds must not be used to pay any of the costs of making any  disclosure of UC information. Grant funds may not be used to pay any of  the costs of making any disclosures under Sec. 603.5(d)(2) (third party  (other than an agent) or disclosure made on an ongoing basis), Sec.  603.5(e) (optional disclosure to a public official), Sec. 603.5(f)  (optional disclosure to an agent or contractor of a public official),  and Sec. 603.5(g) (optional disclosure to BLS), Sec. 603.6(b)  (mandatory disclosures for non-UC purposes), or Sec. 603.22 (mandatory  disclosure for purposes of an IEVS).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> (to  officials with subpoena authority) if the State UC agency has attempted  but not been successful in obtaining reimbursement of costs. Finally,  grant funds may be used to pay costs associated with any disclosure of  UC information if not more than an incidental amount of staff time and  no more than nominal processing costs are involved in making the  disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Calculation of costs. The costs to a State or State UC agency of  processing and handling a request for disclosure of information must be  calculated in accordance with the cost principles and administrative  requirements of 29 CFR part 97 and Office of Management and Budget  Circular No. A-87 (Revised). For the purpose of calculating such costs,  any initial start-up costs incurred by the State UC agency in  preparation for making the requested disclosure(s), such as computer  reprogramming necessary to respond to the request, and the costs of  implementing safeguards and agreements required by Sec. Sec. 603.9 and  603.10, must be charged to and paid by the recipient. (Start-up costs do  not include the costs to the State UC agency of obtaining, compiling, or  maintaining information for its own purposes.) Postage or other delivery  costs incurred in making any disclosure are part of the costs of making  the disclosure. Penalty mail, as defined in 39 U.S.C. 3201(1), must not  be used to transmit information being disclosed, except information  disclosed for purposes of administration of State UC law. As provided in  Sections 453(e)(2) and 453(g) of the SSA, the Secretary of HHS has the  authority to determine what constitutes a reasonable amount for the  reimbursement for disclosures under Section 303(h), SSA, and Section  3304(a)(16)(B), FUTA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>,   payment in advance means full payment of all costs before or at the time  the disclosed information is given in hand or sent to the recipient. The  requirement of payment of costs in this paragraph is met when a State UC  agency has in place a reciprocal cost agreement or arrangement with the  recipient. As used in this section, reciprocal means that the relative  benefits received by each are approximately equal. Payment or  reimbursement of costs must include any initial start-up costs  associated with making the disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Program income. Costs paid as required by this section, and any  funds generated by the disclosure of UC information under this part, are  program income and may be used only as permitted by 29 CFR 97.25(g) (on  program income). Such income may not be used to benefit a State's  general fund or other program.</p>
