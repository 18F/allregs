A bag leak detection  system includes, but is not limited to, an instrument that operates on  triboelectric, electrodynamic, light scattering, light transmittance, or  other effect to continuously monitor relative particulate matter  loadings.</p><p class="depth0">Cadmium melting furnace means any furnace used to melt cadmium or  produce cadmium oxide from the cadmium recovered in the zinc production  process.</p><p class="depth0">Capture system means the collection of equipment used to capture  gases and fumes released from one or more emissions points and then  convey the captured gas stream to a control device. A capture system may  include, but is not limited to, the following components as applicable  to a given capture system design: duct intake devices, hoods,  enclosures, ductwork, dampers, manifolds, plenums, and fans.</p><p class="depth0">Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to  this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this  subpart, including but not limited to any emissions limitation or work  practice standard;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement  an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the  operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a  permit; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Fails to meet any emissions limitation or work practice standard  in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of  whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Primary beryllium production facility means any establishment  engaged in the chemical processing of beryllium ore to produce beryllium  metal, alloy, or oxide, or performing any of the intermediate steps in  these processes. A primary beryllium production facility may also be  known as an extraction plant.</p><p class="depth2">Primary zinc production facility means an installation engaged in  the production, or any intermediate process in the production, of zinc  or zinc oxide from zinc sulfide ore concentrates through the use of  pyrometallurgical techniques.</p><p class="depth2">Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR  70.2.</p><p class="depth2">Roaster means any facility in which a zinc sulfide ore concentrate  charge is heated in the presence of air to eliminate a significant  portion (more than 10 percent) of the sulfur contained in the charge.</p><p class="depth2">Sintering machine means any furnace in which calcines are heated in  the presence of air to agglomerate the calcines into a hard porous mass  called sinter.</p><p class="depth2">Sulfuric acid plant means any facility producing sulfuric acid from  the sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the gases from the roaster.</p><p class="depth2">Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice,  or operational standard, or combination thereof.</p><p class="depth2">Zinc cathode melting furnace means any furnace used to melt the pure  zinc from the electrolytic process.</p>
