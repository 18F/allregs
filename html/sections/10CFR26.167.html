                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Quality assurance program. Each HHS-certified laboratory shall have a quality assurance program that encompasses all aspects of the testing process, including, but not limited to, specimen accessioning, chain of custody, security and reporting of results, initial and confirmatory testing, certification of calibrators and controls, and validation of analytical procedures. The performance characteristics (e.g., accuracy, precision, LOD, limit of quantitation (LOQ), specificity) of each test must be validated and documented for each test. Validation of procedures

must document that carryover does not affect the donor's specimen results. Periodic re-verification of analytical procedures is required. Quality assurance procedures must be designed, implemented, and reviewed to monitor the conduct of each step of the testing process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calibrators and controls required. Each analytical run of specimens for which an initial or confirmatory validity test, or an initial or confirmatory drug test, is being performed must include the appropriate calibrators and controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Quality control requirements for performing initial and confirmatory validity tests.

(1) Any initial drug test performed by an HHS-certified laboratory must use an immunoassay that meets the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for commercial distribution. Non-instrumented immunoassay testing devices that are pending HHS/SAMHSA review and approval may not be used for initial drug testing under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any initial drug test performed by an HHS-certified laboratory must use an immunoassay that meets the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for commercial distribution. Non-instrumented immunoassay testing devices that are pending HHS/SAMHSA review and approval may not be used for initial drug testing under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HHS-certified laboratories may perform multiple initial drug tests for the same drug or drug class, provided that all tests meet the cutoffs and quality control requirements of this part. For example, an HHS-certified laboratory may use immunoassay technique ``A'' for all drugs using the licensee's or other entity's cutoff levels, but specimens testing positive for amphetamines may also be tested using immunoassay technique ``B'' to eliminate any possible positives due to structural analogues; or, a valid analytical result cannot be obtained using immunoassay technique ``A'' and immunoassay technique ``B'' is used in an attempt to obtain a valid analytical result.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Quality control samples for each analytical run of specimens for initial testing must include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sample(s) certified to contain no drugs or drug metabolites (i.e., negative urine samples);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least one positive control with a drug(s) or drug metabolite(s) targeted at 25 percent above the cutoff;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At least one positive control with a drug(s) or drug metabolite(s) targeted at 25 percent below the cutoff;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A sufficient number of calibrators to ensure and document the linearity of the assay method over time in the concentration area of the cutoff (after acceptable values are obtained for the known calibrators, those

values will be used to calculate sample data); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> At least one control that appears to be a donor specimen to the laboratory analysts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A minimum of 10 percent of the total specimens in each analytical run must be quality control samples, as defined by paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Quality control requirements for performing confirmatory drug tests.

The licensee or other entity shall ensure that the HHS-certified laboratory investigates any testing errors or unsatisfactory performance discovered in blind performance testing, as required under Sec. 26.168, in the testing of actual specimens, or through the processing of reviews, as well as any other errors or matters that could adversely reflect on the testing process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever possible, the investigation must determine relevant facts and identify the root cause(s) of the testing or process error. The licensee or other entity, and the HHS-certified laboratory, shall take action to correct the causes of any errors or unsatisfactory performance that are within each entity's control. Sufficient records shall be maintained to furnish evidence of activities affecting quality. The licensee or other entity shall assure that the cause of the condition is determined and that corrective action is taken to preclude repetition. The identification of the significant condition, the cause of the condition, and the corrective action taken shall be documented and reported to appropriate levels of management.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a false positive error occurs on a blind performance test sample or on a regular specimen, the licensee or other entity shall require the laboratory to take corrective action to minimize the occurrence of the particular error in the future. If there is reason to believe that the error could have been systematic, the licensee or other entity may also require review and re-analysis of previously run specimens.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a false positive error occurs on a blind performance test sample and the error is determined to be technical or methodological, the licensee or other entity shall instruct the laboratory to provide all quality control data from the batch or analytical run of specimens that included a false positive sample. In addition, the licensee or other entity shall require the laboratory to retest all specimens that analyzed as positive for that drug or metabolite, or as adulterated, substituted, dilute, or invalid in validity testing, from the time of final resolution of the error back to the time of the last satisfactory performance test cycle. This retesting must be documented by a statement signed by the laboratory's responsible person. The licensee or other entity and the NRC also may require an onsite review of the laboratory, which may be conducted unannounced during any hours of operation of the laboratory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Accuracy. Volumetric pipettes and measuring devices must be certified for accuracy or be checked by gravimetric, colorimetric, or other verification procedures. Automatic pipettes and dilutors must be checked for accuracy and reproducibility both before being placed in service and periodically thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Calibrators and controls. Laboratory calibrators and controls must be

prepared using pure drug reference materials, stock standard solutions obtained from other laboratories, or standard solutions that are obtained from commercial manufacturers and are properly labeled as to content and concentration. Calibrators and controls may not be prepared from the same stock solution. The standards and controls must be labeled with the following dates: when received; when prepared or opened; when placed in service; and when scheduled for expiration.</p>
