                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, scanning  receivers and frequency converters designed or marketed for use with  scanning receivers, shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be incapable of operating (tuning), or readily being altered by  the user to operate, within the frequency bands allocated to the  Cellular Radiotelephone Service in part 22 of this chapter (cellular  telephone bands). Scanning receivers capable of ``readily being altered  by the user'' include, but are not limited to, those for which the  ability to receive transmissions in the cellular telephone bands can be  added by clipping the leads of, or installing, a simple component such  as a diode, resistor or jumper wire; replacing a plug-in semiconductor  chip; or programming a semiconductor chip using special access codes or  an external device, such as a personal computer. Scanning receivers, and  frequency converters designed for use with scanning receivers, also  shall be incapable of converting digital cellular communication  transmissions to analog voice audio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be designed so that the tuning, control and filtering circuitry  is inaccessible. The design must be such that any attempts to modify the  equipment to receive transmissions from the Cellular Radiotelephone  Service likely will render the receiver inoperable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, scanning  receivers shall reject any signals from the Cellular Radiotelephone  Service frequency bands that are 38 dB or lower based upon a 12 dB SINAD  measurement, which is considered the threshold where a signal can be  clearly discerned from any interference that may be present.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scanning receivers and frequency converters designed or marketed  for use with scanning receivers, are not subject to the requirements of  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section provided that they are  manufactured exclusively for, and marketed exclusively to, entities  described in 18 U.S.C. 2512(2), or are marketed exclusively as test  equipment pursuant to Sec. 15.3(dd).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Modification of a scanning receiver to receive transmissions  from Cellular Radiotelephone Service frequency bands will be considered  to constitute manufacture of such equipment. This includes any  individual, individuals, entity or organization that modifies one or  more scanners. Any modification to a scanning receiver to receive  transmissions from the Cellular Radiotelephone Service frequency bands  voids the certification of the scanning receiver, regardless of the date  of manufacture of the original unit. In addition, the provisions of  Sec. 15.23 shall not be interpreted as permitting modification of a  scanning receiver to receiver Cellular Radiotelephone Service  transmissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Scanning receivers and frequency converters designed for use  with scanning receivers shall not be assembled from kits or marketed in  kit form unless they comply with the requirements in paragraph (a)  through (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Scanning receivers shall have a label permanently affixed to the  product, and this label shall be readily visible to the purchaser at the  time of purchase. The label shall read as follows: WARNING: MODIFICATION  OF THIS DEVICE TO RECEIVE CELLULAR RADIOTELEPHONE SERVICE SIGNALS IS  PROHIBITED UNDER FCC RULES AND FEDERAL LAW.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Permanently affixed'' means that the label is etched,  engraved, stamped, silkscreened, indelible printed or otherwise  permanently marked on a permanently attached part of the equipment or on  a nameplate of metal,   plastic or other material fastened to the equipment by welding,  riveting, or permanent adhesive. The label shall be designed to last the  expected lifetime of the equipment in the environment in which the  equipment may be operated and must not be readily detachable. The label  shall not be a stick-on, paper label.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the device is so small that it is not practicable to place  the warning label on it, the information required by this paragraph  shall be placed in a prominent location in the instruction manual or  pamphlet supplied to the user and shall also be placed on the container  in which the device is marketed. However, the FCC identifier must be  displayed on the device.  [64 FR 22561, Apr. 27, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 32582, June 15, 2001]    Sec. 15.122  [Reserved]</p>
