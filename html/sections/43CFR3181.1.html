                            <p class="depth0">The model unit agreement set forth in Sec. 3186.1 of this title, is  acceptable for use in unproven areas. Unique situations requiring  special provisions should be clearly identified, since these and other  special conditions may necessitate a modification of the model unit  agreement set forth in Sec. 3186.1 of this title. Any proposed special  provisions or other modifications of the model agreement should be  submitted for preliminary consideration so that any necessary revision  may be prescribed prior to execution by the interested parties. Where  Federal lands constitute less than 10 percent of the total unit area, a  non-Federal unit agreement may be used. Upon submission of such an  agreement, the authorized officer will take appropriate action to commit  the Federal lands.</p>
