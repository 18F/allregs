                            <p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The provision at 1852.233-70 provides for an alternative to a  protest to the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO).  This alternative gives bidders or offerors the ability to protest  directly to the contracting officer (CO) or to request an independent  review by the Assistant Administrator for Procurement (or designee). The  Agency review shall be deemed to be at the CO level when the request is  silent as to the level of review desired. The Agency review shall be  deemed to be at the level of the Assistant Administrator for Procurement  (or designee) when the request specifies a level above the CO, even if  the request does not specifically request an independent review by the  Assistant Administrator for Procurement. Such reviews are separate and  distinct from the Ombudsman Program described at 1815.7001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> NASA shall summarily dismiss and take no further action upon any  protest to the Agency if the substance of the protest is pending in  judicial proceedings or the protester has filed a protest on the same  acquisition with the GAO prior to receipt of an Agency protest decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When a bidder or offeror submits an Agency protest to the CO or  alternatively requests an independent review by the Assistant  Administrator for Procurement, the decision of the CO or the Assistant  Administrator for Procurement shall be final and is not subject to any  appeal or reconsideration within NASA.
