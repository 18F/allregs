                            <p class="depth0">The lender is primarily responsible for determining credit quality and must address all of the elements of credit quality in a written credit analysis including adequacy of equity, cash flow, collateral, history, management, and the current status of the industry for which credit is to be extended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cash flow. All efforts will be made to structure or restructure debt so that the business has adequate debt coverage and the ability to accommodate expansion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Collateral. (1) Collateral must have documented value sufficient to protect the interest of the lender and the Agency and, except as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the discounted collateral value will be at least equal to the loan amount. Lenders will discount collateral consistent with sound loan-to-value policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Collateral must have documented value sufficient to protect the interest of the lender and the Agency and, except as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the discounted collateral value will be at least equal to the loan amount. Lenders will discount collateral consistent with sound loan-to-value policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Some businesses are predominantly cash-flow oriented, and where cash flow and profitability are strong, loan-to-value coverage may be discounted accordingly. A loan primarily based on cash flow must be supported by a successful and documented financial history.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Industry. Current status of the industry will be considered and businesses in areas of decline will be required to provide strong business plans which outline how they differ from the current trends. The regulatory environment surrounding the particular business or industry will be considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Equity. (1) A minimum of 10 percent tangible balance sheet equity will be required for existing businesses at loan closing. A minimum of 20 percent tangible balance sheet equity will be required for new businesses at loan closing. For energy projects, the minimum tangible balance sheet equity requirement range will be between 25 percent and 40 percent. Criteria for considering the minimum equity required for an individual application will be based on: existing businesses with successful financial and management history vs. start-up businesses; personal/corporate guarantees offered; contractual relationships with suppliers and buyers; credit rating; and strength of the business plan/feasibility study. Where the application is a request to refinance outstanding Federal direct or guaranteed loans, without any new financing, the equity requirement may be determined using adjusted tangible net worth. An application that combines a refinancing guarantee request with a new loan guarantee request is subject

to the standard, unadjusted, equity requirement except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) of this section. Increases or decreases in the equity requirements may be imposed or granted as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A minimum of 10 percent tangible balance sheet equity will be required for existing businesses at loan closing.

In order for a reduction to be considered, the borrower must furnish the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Collateralized personal and corporate guarantees, including any parent, subsidiary, or affiliated company, when feasible and legally permissible (in accordance with Sec. 4279.149 of this subpart), and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Pro forma and historical financial statements that indicate the business to be financed meets or exceeds the median quartile (as identified in the Risk Management Association's Annual Statement Studies or similar publication) for the current ratio, quick ratio, debt-to-worth ratio, debt coverage ratio, and working capital.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The approval official may require more than the minimum equity requirements provided in this paragraph if the official makes a written determination that special circumstances necessitate this course of action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The equity requirement must be met in the form of either cash or tangible earning assets contributed to the business and reflected on the balance sheet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lender must certify that the equity requirement was determined using balance sheets prepared in accordance with GAAP and met upon giving effect to the entirety of the loan in the calculation, whether or not the loan itself is fully advanced, as of the date the guaranteed loan is closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Lien priorities. The entire loan will be secured by the same security with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the loan. The unguaranteed portion of the loan will neither be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion. A parity or junior position may be considered provided that discounted collateral values are adequate to secure the loan in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section after considering prior liens.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Management. A thorough review of key management personnel will be completed to ensure that the business has adequately trained and experienced managers.
