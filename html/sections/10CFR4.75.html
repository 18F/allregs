                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued  under Sec. 4.74 shall be restored to full eligibility to receive  Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of  that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance  with this subpart and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully  comply with this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order  entered pursuant to Sec. 4.74 may at any time request the responsible  NRC official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal  financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information  showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of  paragraph (a) of this section. If the responsible NRC official  determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore  such eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the responsible NRC official denies any such request, the  applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing,  specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall  thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with the decision on the  record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible  NRC official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such  eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. While proceedings under  this section are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued  under Sec. 4.74 shall remain in effect.
