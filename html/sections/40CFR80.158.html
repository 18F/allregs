                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contents. For each occasion when any gasoline refiner, importer,  reseller, distributor, carrier, retailer, wholesale purchaser-consumer,  oxygenate blender, detergent manufacturer, distributor, carrier, or  blender, transfers custody or title to any gasoline, detergent, or  detergent-additized PRC other than when detergent-additized gasoline is  sold or dispensed at a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer  facility to the ultimate consumer, the transferor shall provide to the  transferee, and the transferee shall acquire from the transferor,  documents which accurately include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The names and addresses of the transferee and transferor; the  address requirement may be fulfilled, in the alternative, through  separate documentation which establishes said addresses and is  maintained by the parties and made available to EPA for the same length  of time as required for the PTDs, provided that the normal business  procedure of these parties is not to identify addresses on PTDs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date of the transfer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The volume of product transferred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The identity of the product being transferred (i.e., its  identity as base gasoline, detergent, detergent-additized gasoline, or  specified detergent-additized oxygenate or detergent-additized gasoline  blending stock that comprises a detergent-additized PRC). PTDs for  detergent-additized gasoline or PRC are not required to identify the  particular detergent used to additize the product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the product being transferred consists of two or more  different types of product subject to this regulation, i.e., base  gasoline, detergent-additized gasoline, or specified detergent-additized  PRC, then the PTD for the commingled product must identify each such  type of component contained in the commingled product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the product being transferred is base gasoline, then in  addition to the base gasoline identification, the following warning must  be stated on the PTD: ``Not for sale to the ultimate consumer''. If,  pursuant to Sec. 80.160(a), the product being transferred is exempt base  gasoline to be used for research, development, or test purposes only,  the following warning must also be stated on the PTD: ``For use in  research, development, and test programs only.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The name of the detergent additive as reported in its  registration must be used to identify the detergent package on its PTD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the product being transferred is leaded gasoline, then the  PTD must disclose that the product contains lead and/or phosphorous, as  applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the product being transferred is detergent that is only  authorized for the control of carburetor deposits, then the following  must be stated on the detergent's transfer document: ``For use with  leaded gasoline only.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> If the product being transferred is detergent-additized gasoline  that has been overadditized in anticipation of the later (or earlier)  addition of PRC, then the PTD must include a statement that the product  has been overadditized to account for a specified volume in gallons, or  a specified percentage of the product's total volume, of additional,  specified PRC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Gasoline may not be additized with a detergent authorized only  for the control of carburetor deposits and whose product transfer  document states ``For use with leaded gasoline only'', and gasoline may  not be additized at the lower concentration specified for a detergent  authorized at a lower concentration for the control of carburetor  deposits only, unless the   product transfer document for the gasoline to be additized identifies it  as leaded gasoline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of product codes and other non-regulatory language. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Product codes and other non-regulatory language may not be used as a  substitute for the specified PTD warning language specified in paragraph  (a)(6) of this section for base gasoline, except that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The specified warning language may be omitted for bulk transfers  of base gasoline from a refinery to a pipeline if there is a prior  written agreement between the parties specifying that all such gasoline  is unadditized and will not be transferred to the ultimate consumer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Product codes may be used as a substitute for the specified  warning language provided that the PTD is an electronic data interchange  (EDI) document being used solely for the transfer of title to the base  gasoline, and provided that the product codes otherwise comply with the  requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Product codes and other language not specified in this section  may otherwise be used to comply with PTD information requirements,  provided that they are clear, accurate, and not misleading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If product codes are used, they must be standardized throughout  the distribution system in which they are used, and downstream parties  must be informed of their full meaning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> PTD exemption for small transfers of additized gasoline.  Transfers of additized gasoline are exempt from the PTD requirements of  this section provided all the following conditions are followed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The product is being transferred by a distributor who is not the  product's detergent blender; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The recipient is a wholesale purchaser-consumer (WPC) or other  ultimate consumer of gasoline, for its own use only or for that of its  agents or employees; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The volume of additized gasoline being transferred is not  greater than 550 gallons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recordkeeping period. Any person creating, providing or  acquiring product transfer documentation for gasoline, detergent, or  detergent-additized PRC, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this  section, shall retain the documents required by this section for a  period of five years from the date the product transfer documentation  was created, received or transferred, as applicable, and shall deliver  such documents to EPA upon request. WPCs are not required to retain PTDs  of additized gasoline received by them.  [61 FR 35362, July 5, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 60001, Nov. 6, 1997]</p>
