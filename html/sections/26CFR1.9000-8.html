                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time for payment specified in Code. (1) If the treatment of any payment (including its allowance as a deduction or otherwise) is dependent upon the making of a payment within a period of time specified in the Code the period within which the payment is to be made is extended where the amount to be paid is increased by reason of the repeal of sections 452 and 462: Provided, That:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the treatment of any payment (including its allowance as a deduction or otherwise) is dependent upon the making of a payment within a period of time specified in the Code the period within which the payment is to be made is extended where the amount to be paid is increased by reason of the repeal of sections 452 and 462: Provided, That:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer, because of a pre-existing obligation, is required to make a payment or an additional payment to another person by reason of such repeal;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The deductibility of the payment or additional payment is contingent upon its being made within a period prescribed by the Code, which period expires after the close of the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The payment or additional payment is made on or before December 15, 1955.

If the foregoing conditions are met, the payment or additional payment will be treated as having been made within the time specified in the Code, and, subject to any other conditions in the Code, it shall be deductible for the year to which it relates. The provision of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. Section 267 (relating to losses, expenses and interest between related taxpayers) applies to amounts accrued by taxpayer A for salary payable to B. For the calendar year 1954, A is obligated to pay B a salary equal to 5 percent of A's taxable income for the taxable year. The amount accrued as salary payable to B for 1954 is $5,000 with the taxable income reflecting the application of section 462. As a result of the repeal of section 462 the salary payable to B for 1954 is increased to $6,000. The additional $1,000 is paid to B on December 15, 1955. In recomputing A's tax liability for 1954 the additional deduction of $1,000 for salary payable to B will be treated as having been made within two and one-half months after the close of the taxable year and will be deductible in that year.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. On March 1, 1955, Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer using the accrual method of accounting, makes a payment described in section 404(a)(6) (relating to contributions to an employees' trust) of $10,000 which is accrued for 1954 and is determined on the basis of the amount of taxable income for that year. The taxpayer filed its return on March 15, 1955. By reason of the repeal of section 462, X's taxable income is increased so that it is required to make an additional contribution of $2,000 to the employees' trust. The additional payment is made on December 15, 1955. For purposes of recomputing X's tax liability for 1954, this additional payment is deemed to have been made on the last day of 1954.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The time for inclusion in the taxable income of the payee of any additional payment of the type described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, shall be determined without regard to section 4(c)(3) of the Act of June 15, 1955, and Sec. Sec. 1.9000-2 to 1.9000-8, inclusive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Dividends paid under section 561. under section 4(c)(4) of the Act of June 15, 1955, the period during which distributions may be recognized as dividends paid under section 561 for a taxable year to which section 452 or 462 apply may be extended under the conditions set forth below.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accumulated earnings tax or personal holding company tax. In the case of the accumulated earnings tax or the personal holding company tax, if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The income of a corporation is increased for a taxable year by reason of the repeal of sections 452 and 462 so that it would become liable for the tax (or an increase in the tax) imposed on accumulated earnings or personal holding companies unless additional dividends are distributed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The corporation distributes dividends to its stockholders after the 15th day of the 3d month following the close of its taxable year and on or before December 15, 1955, which dividends are attributable to an increase in its accumulated taxable income or undistributed personal holding company income, as the case may be, resulting from the repeal of sections 452 and 462, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The corporation elects in its statement, submitted under Sec. 1.9000-3,

to have the provisions of section 4(c)(4) of the Act of June 15, 1955, apply:

Then such dividends shall be treated as having been paid on the last day of the taxable year to which the statement applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Regulated investment companies. In the case of a regulated investment company taxable under section 852, if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The taxable income of the regulated investment company is increased by reason of the repeal of sections 452 and 462 (without regard to any deduction for dividends paid as provided for in this subparagraph);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The company distributes dividends to its stockholders after the 15th day of the 3d month following the close of its taxable year and on or before December 15, 1955, which dividends are attributable to an increase in its investment company income resulting from the repeal of sections 452 and 462; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The company elects in its statement, submitted under Sec. 1.9000-3, to have the provisions of section 4(c)(4) of the Act of June 15, 1955, apply:

then such dividends are to be treated as having been paid on the last day of the taxable year to which the statement applies. The dividends paid are to be determined under this subparagraph without regard to the provisions of section 855.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Related provisions. An election made under subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph is irrevocable. The time for inclusion in the taxable income of the distributees of any distributions of the type described in subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph shall be determined without regard to section 4(c)(4) of the Act of June 15, 1955, and Sec. Sec. 1.9000-2 to 1.9000-8, inclusive.</p><p class="depth3">RETIREMENT-STRAIGHT LINE ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 1958</p><p class="depth3">Source: Sections 1.9001 through 1.9001-4 contained in T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12158, Nov. 26, 1960, unless otherwise noted.</p>
