                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. An interstate pipeline must compute the income  tax component of its cost-of-service by using tax normalization for all  transactions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tax normalization means computing the income  tax component as if transactions recognized in each period for  ratemaking purposes are also recognized in the same amount and in the  same period for income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Commission-approved ratemaking method means a ratemaking method  approved by the Commission in a final decision. This includes a  ratemaking method that is part of an approved settlement or arbitration  providing that the ratemaking method is to be effective beyond the term  of the settlement or arbitration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Income tax purposes means for the purpose of computing actual  income tax under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or the  income tax provisions of the laws of a State or political subdivision of  a State (including franchise taxes).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Income tax component means that part of the cost-of-service that  covers income tax expenses allowable by the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Ratemaking purposes means for the purpose of fixing, modifying,  accepting, approving, disapproving, or rejecting rates under the Natural  Gas Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Tax effect means the tax reduction or addition associated with a  specific expense or revenue transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Transaction means an activity or event that gives rise to an  accounting entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reduction of, and addition to, Rate Base. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The rate base of  an interstate pipeline using tax normalization under this section must  be reduced by the balances that are properly recordable in Account 281,  ``Accumulated deferred income taxes-accelerated amortization property'';  Account 282, ``Accumulated deferred income taxes--other property'': and  Account 283, ``Accumulated deferred income taxes--other.'' Balances that  are properly recordable in Account 190, ``Accumulated deferred income  taxes,'' must be treated as an addition to rate base. Include, as an  addition or reduction, as appropriate, amounts in Account 182.3, Other  regulatory assets, and Account 254, Other regulatory liabilities, that  result from a deficiency or excess in the deferred tax accounts (see  paragraph (d) of this section) and which have been, or are soon expected  to be, authorized for recovery or refund through rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such rate base reductions or additions must be limited to  deferred taxes related to rate base, construction, or other costs and  revenues affecting jurisdictional cost-of-service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rules. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This paragraph applies:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the rate applicant has not provided deferred taxes in the  same amount that would have accrued had tax normalization always been  applied; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If, as a result of changes in tax rates, the accumulated  provision for deferred taxes becomes deficient in, or in excess of,  amounts necessary to meet future tax liabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The interstate pipeline must compute the income tax component in  its cost-of-service by making provision for any excess or deficiency in  deferred taxes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The interstate pipeline must apply a Commission-approved  ratemaking method made specifically applicable to the interstate  pipeline for determining the cost-of-service provision described in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If no Commission-approved ratemaking  method has been made specifically applicable to the interstate pipeline,  then the interstate pipeline must use some ratemaking method for making  such provision, and the appropriateness of such method will be subject  to case-by-case determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An interstate pipeline must continue to include, as an addition  or reduction to rate base, any deficiency or excess attributable to  prior flow-through or changes in tax rates (paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and  (d)(1)(ii) of this section), until such deficiency or excess is fully  amortized in accordance with a Commission approved ratemaking method.</p>
