                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Determination of represented value. Manufacturers must determine the represented value, which includes the certified rating, for each basic model of commercial refrigerator, freezer, or refrigerator-freezer either by testing, in conjunction with the applicable sampling provisions, or by applying an AEDM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Units to be tested. (i) If the represented value for a given basic model is determined through testing, the general requirements of Sec. 429.11 are applicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the represented value for a given basic model is determined through testing, the general requirements of Sec. 429.11 are applicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each basic model selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any represented value of energy consumption or other measure of energy use of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The mean of the sample, where:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31DE13.157</p><p class="depth0">And xx is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.10, where:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31DE13.158

And xx is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95% one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from Appendix A to subpart B of part 429).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Alternative efficiency determination methods. In lieu of testing, a represented value of efficiency or consumption for a basic model of commercial refrigerator, freezer or refrigerator-freezer must be determined through the application of an AEDM pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 429.70 and the provisions of this section, where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any represented value of energy consumption or other measure of energy use of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the output of the AEDM and less than or equal to the Federal standard for that basic model; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any represented value of energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the output of the AEDM and greater than or equal to the Federal standard for that basic model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Certification reports. (1) The requirements of Sec. 429.12 are applicable to commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The requirements of Sec. 429.12 are applicable to commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 429.12(b)(13), a certification report must include the following public, equipment-specific information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The daily energy consumption in kilowatt hours per day (kWh/day);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rating temperature (e.g. lowest product application temperature, if

applicable) in degrees Fahrenheit ( [deg]F); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The chilled or frozen compartment volume in cubic feet (ft\3\), the adjusted volume in cubic feet (ft\3\), or the total display area (TDA) in feet squared (ft\2\) (as appropriate for the equipment class).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 429.12(b)(13), a certification report must include the following additional, equipment-specific information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether the basic model is engineered-to-order; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For any basic model rated with an AEDM, whether the manufacturer elects the witness test option for verification testing. (See Sec. 429.70(c)(5)(iii) for options). However, the manufacturer may not select more than 10% of AEDM-rated basic models.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 429.12(b)(13), a certification report must include supplemental information submitted in PDF format. The equipment-specific, supplemental information must include testing instructions (e.g., charging instructions); and which, if any, special features were included in rating the basic model. A manufacturer may also include with a certification report other supplementary items in PDF format (e.g., manuals) for DOE consideration in performing testing under subpart C of this part. Manufacturers may submit a single supplemental PDF with information for multiple basic models as long as the basic models to which the PDF applies are designated.
