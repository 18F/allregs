                            <p class="depth0">Subsection (d) of 5 U.S.C. 3110 authorizes the Office of Personnel  Management to prescribe regulations authorizing the temporary employment  of relatives, in certain conditions, notwithstanding the restrictions.  This regulation sets forth exceptions to the restrictions. When  necessary to meet urgent needs resulting from an emergency posing an  immediate threat to life or property, or a national emergency as defined  in Sec. 230.402(a)(1) of this title, a public official may employ  relatives to meet those needs without regard to the restrictions on the  employment of relatives in 5 U.S.C. 3110. Such appointments are  temporary and may not exceed 30 days, but the agency may extend such an  appointment for one additional 30-day period if the emergency need still  exists at the time of the extension.</p>
