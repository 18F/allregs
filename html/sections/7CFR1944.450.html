I. General. This exhibit will be used by Farmers Home Administration</p><p class="depth0"><em>(FmHA)</em> or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and</p><p class="depth0">the Grantee in determining Grantee performance as required in</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 1944.417(b) of this subpart.II. Determining technical assistance (TA) cost per unit.</p><p class="depth0">A. Equivalent units are used to measure progress at any time during the period of the grant. It is necessary because self-help grantees have several groups of families in various stages of progress during the period of the grant. The following formula has been developed to provide a more accurate method of determining progress.</p><p class="depth0">Formula------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">In percent--</p><p class="depth0">-------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Phase breakdown                   Value of</p><p class="depth0">each phase   Cumulative------------------------------------------------------------------------Pre-construction:</p><p class="depth0">Phase I.....................................           10           10</p><p class="depth0">Phase II....................................           10           10Construction:</p><p class="depth0">Phase III...................................           80       21-100------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">B. Using the Description of Phase Breakdown as a guide, the project staff selects the total percentage pertinent to the stage the self-help group is in and multiplies that percentage by the number of families (units) in the group. The result is the equivalent number of units completed. No credit may be given for Phase I, if the application is rejected. When this computation has been completed for each group that falls within Phases I-III, the total number of equivalent units is divided into the total grant funds expended to that date. The result is the TA cost per unit at that stage of the program's progress.</p><p class="depth0">C. The definition of pre-construction and construction phases described are follows:</p><p class="depth0">Pre-Construction</p><p class="depth0">Phase I: Hold community meetings; conduct interviews; obtain house plans; prepare cost estimates; begin search for land; submit family applications to the lender; lender runs credit check; applications. Lender either approves or rejects.</p><p class="depth0">Phase II: Organize an association of section 502 Rural Housing eligible families; association conducts weekly meetings at which required lender forms are discussed and completed; house plans and land sites are selected; outside speakers explain and discuss taxes, insurance, how to keep a checking account, how interest is computed, home maintenance, decorating, and landscaping; etc.; completed loan dockets for each family are submitted to the lender. Family loan dockets are reviewed and recommendations made as to the loan amounts requested; the lender reviews family loan dockets; preliminary title search of each proposed building site is begun; requests loan check from Finance Office; when check arrives, final title search is made, loan closed, checking accounts opened, and construction begun.</p><p class="depth0">Construction: The grantee will utilize exhibit B-2 which outlines 27 construction tasks to determine the percentage of completed construction activities.</p><p class="depth0">D. The computation of equivalent units and TA costs will be computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Exhibit C will be used for recording the following information and construction in this example which starts January 1.</p><p class="depth0">Step 1</p><p class="depth0">Both the grantee and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan application records to determine the percentage of completion for each family in the pre-construction phase of the program. These are Phases I-III. Total these percentages to find the number of ``equivalent units'' (EUs) completed at that date during pre-construction. For example, if there are eight families in Group 2 and all have completed the 20 percent phase of pre-construction, then there would be 1.6 EUs in the pre-construction phase of the program as of that date. Each phase must be completed before it is considered in the calculation.</p><p class="depth0">Step 2</p><p class="depth0">Refer to the records of construction progress for families in the construction Phase III. As of that date, the director totals the percentage of completion figures for each family as follows:
Askew...........................................................    0.45Whited..........................................................    0.40Martinez........................................................    0.40Gonzalez........................................................    0.38Sherry..........................................................    0.34Duran...........................................................    0.33Johnson.........................................................    0.13Harvey..........................................................    0.31</p><p class="depth0">-------</p><p class="depth0">EUs...........................................................    2.92</p><p class="depth0">Total production in the construction phase is therefore 2.92 EUs as of that date.</p><p class="depth0">Step 3</p><p class="depth0">Add the pre-construction and construction subtotals together:
Pre-construction................................................    1.60Construction....................................................    2.92</p><p class="depth0">-------</p><p class="depth0">Total EUs.....................................................    4.52</p><p class="depth0">This provides the total EUs of production during the first three months of operation. Steps 1, 2, and 3 will be used to complete items 7, 8 and 9 of exhibit B of this subpart.
III. Preparation:</p><p class="depth0">Compile exhibit B of this subpart in an original and four copies. The exhibit will be signed by the TA Grantee.

Objectives</p><p class="depth0">The objective of a Site Option (SO) loan under Section 523(b)(1)(B) of Title V of the Housing Act of 1949 is to enable technical assistance (TA) grantees to establish revolving fund accounts to obtain options on land needed to make sites available to families that will build their own homes by the self-help method. An SO loan will be considered only when sites cannot be made available by other means including a regular Rural Housing Site (RHS) loan.</p><p class="depth0">II. Eligibility Requirements</p><p class="depth0">To be eligible for an SO loan, the applicant must be a TA grantee that is currently operating in a satisfactory manner under a TA grant agreement. If the SO loan applicant has applied for TA funds but is not already a TA grantee and it appears that the TA grant will be made, the SO loan may be approved but not closed until the TA grant is closed.</p><p class="depth0">III. Loan Purposes</p><p class="depth0">Loans may be made only as necessary to enable eligible applicants to establish revolving accounts with which to obtain options on land that will be needed as building sites by self-help families participating in the TA self-help housing program. Loans will not be made to pay the full purchase price of land but only for the minimum amounts necessary to obtain an option from the seller. The option should be for as long as necessary but in no case should the option be for less than 90 days.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Limitations</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the amount of an SO loan will exceed $10,000, the prior consent of the National Office shall be obtained before approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of the SO loan should not exceed 15 percent of the purchase price of the land expected to be under option at any one time, unless a higher percent is authorized by the State Director when other land in not available or the particular area requires more down payment than elsewhere or similar circumstances exist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 440-34, ``Option to Purchase Real Property,'' will be used without modification in all cases for obtaining options under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The limitations of Sec. 1822.266(b) (1) and (2) of subpart F of part 1822 of this chapter (FmHA Instruction 444.8, paragraphs VI B (1) and (2)) concerning land purchase will apply to options purchased under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">V. Rates and Terms</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Interest. Loans will be made at an interest rate of 3 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Repayment period. Each SO loan will be repaid in one installment which will include the entire principal balance and accrued interest. The maximum repayment period for each SO loan will be the applicant's remaining TA grant funding period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A shorter repayment period will be established if SO funds will not be needed for the entire TA grant funding period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a regular RHS loan is to be processed, the SO loan should be scheduled for repayment when RHS loan funds will be available to purchase the land and repay the amount of SO funds advanced on the option, unless SO loan funds will still be needed to purchase other options. Under no circumstances, however, will the repayment period exceed the applicant's remaining TA grant funding period.</p><p class="depth0">VI.
