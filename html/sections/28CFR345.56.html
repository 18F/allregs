                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Inmate workers are granted FPI vacation pay by the SOI when their  continued good work performance justifies such pay, based on such  criteria as quality of work, attendance and punctuality, attentiveness,  and adherence to industry operating regulations. The inmate must submit  a written request for vacation time, ordinarily two weeks in advance of  the requested vacation time. The work supervisor must recommend to the  SOI the vacation time to be taken or paid. Eligibility for vacation pay  must be verified by the Business Office prior to approval by the SOI.  The SOI may declare an inmate ineligible for vacation credit because of  an inmate's unsatisfactory work performance during the month in which  such credit was to occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An inmate may take accrued vacation time for visits,  participation in institution programs or for other good reasons at the  discretion of the SOI. Industrial managers should make every reasonable  attempt to schedule an inmate worker's vacations so as not to conflict  with the workforce requirements of FPI factory production schedules and  Inmate Systems Management requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An inmate temporarily assigned to the Industrial detail, e.g.,  on construction details, also earns vacation credit which he or she must  take or be paid for at the end of the temporary assignment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An inmate must take and/or be paid for vacation credit within  sixty days after each annual eligibility date of the inmate's most  recent date of assignment to FPI. An inmate who elects not to take  vacation time must indicate this in writing. That inmate shall receive  pay for the annual vacation credit in a lump sum on the regular monthly  payroll. This amount is ordinarily paid within sixty days after the  annual eligibility date of the inmate's most recent date of assignment  to FPI. An inmate whose employment is terminated by release,  reassignment, transfer, or other reasons, and who has unused vacation  credit shall be paid for this credit on the monthly payroll.</p>
