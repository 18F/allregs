                                Sec. 241.4  Relocating retail services; adding new retail service facilities.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Application. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided, this section  applies when the Postal Service makes a tentative decision to relocate  all retail services from a retail service facility to a separate  existing physical building, or to add a new retail service facility for  a community. As used in this section, ``retail services'' means the  single-piece mail services offered to individual members of the public  on a walk-in basis at a retail service facility, and a ``retail service  facility'' is a physical building where Postal Service employees provide  such retail services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> apply to temporary additions  of retail service facilities, temporary or emergency relocations of  retail services, and to provisional relocations of retail services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Postal Service may implement temporary additions or  relocations without undertaking the process in paragraph (c) of this  section when necessary to support Postal Service business for holidays,  special events, or overflow business. Temporary additions and  relocations normally will be limited to 180 days in duration. Any  additional incremental time periods of up to 180 days each must be  approved by the vice president, Facilities or his designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Postal Service may implement emergency relocations without   first undertaking the process in paragraph (c) of this section when the  Postal Service determines relocation is required to protect Postal  Service business due to events such as earthquakes, floods, fire,  potential or actual OSHA violations, safety factors, environmental  causes, other business disrupting events, or as necessary to protect  employees, customers, or the security of the mail. Following an  emergency relocation, as soon as the Postal Service determines it is  feasible to identify the long-term location for the retail services, the  Postal Service will make a tentative decision to remain in the emergency  relocation site on a long-term basis, to return to the original retail  service facility (if feasible), or to relocate to another site. Unless  the decision is to return to the original retail service facility, the  Postal Service then will follow the process in paragraph (c) of this  section with respect to collecting and considering community input on a  proposal to implement that decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Postal Service may implement provisional relocations in  connection with lease terminations or expirations, or in connection with  a lessor exercising a right to require the Postal Service to move to  alternate premises, when the Postal Service has not already undertaken  the process in paragraph (c) of this section for such relocations. Not  later than 180 days following a provisional relocation, the Postal  Service will make a tentative decision to remain in the provisional  relocation site on a long-term basis or to relocate to another site.  After that decision, the Postal Service will follow the process in  paragraph (c) of this section with respect to collecting and considering  community input on a proposal to implement that decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> This section applies to tentative decisions described in  paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) made on or after March 23, 2015. The rules  under Sec. 241.4 in effect prior to that date shall apply to projects  described in paragraph (a) of this section undertaken prior to that  date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide opportunities  for community members and their elected local officials to appeal Postal  Service tentative decisions described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of  this section and to give input on proposals for implementing those  decisions (each a ``proposal''), and to require the Postal Service to  consider any appeals and input in arriving at final decisions to proceed  with, modify, or cancel proposals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Collecting and considering community input. When the Postal  Service makes a tentative decision described in paragraphs (a)(1) and  (a)(2) of this section, a Postal Service representative will take the  following steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identify the community and engage local elected officials. The  Postal Service representative will identify the community the Postal  Service anticipates would be affected by implementing the proposal,  taking into account such factors as the Postal Service determines are  appropriate for the proposal. The Postal Service representative then  will deliver to one or more local elected public officials a written  outline of the proposal and offer to discuss the proposal with them. The  Postal Service representative may elect to conduct that discussion  either in person or using any other appropriate communication tool,  including electronic communications. If the officials accept the offer,  then the Postal Service representative will identify the need and  outline the proposal that is under consideration to meet it, explain the  process by which the Postal Service will solicit and consider input from  the affected community, and solicit input from the local officials  regarding the proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notify the community and arrange for public presentation. The  Postal Service will send an initial news release outlining the proposal  to one or more news media serving the community and, if the community  has a retail service facility, then the Postal Service also will post a  copy of the information given to local officials or the news release in  the public lobby of that retail service facility. If the proposal  concerns relocating retail services from a leased facility, then, using  the most current notice address information in the Postal Service's file  for the site, the Postal Service will deliver to the lessor a copy of  the information   given to local officials, provided, however, that no such notice will be  required when the lessor has terminated the Postal Service's lease or  has declined to renew the Postal Service lease on terms acceptable to  the Postal Service. Additionally, the Postal Service representative will  ask the local officials to place a Postal Service presentation of the  proposal on the regular agenda of the next scheduled public meeting, or  will schedule a separate Postal Service public meeting concerning the  proposal. At least 15 days prior to the meeting, the Postal Service will  advertise the date, time, and location of the public meeting in a local  news medium and, if the community has an existing retail service  facility, then the Postal Service also will post in the public lobby of  that retail service facility a notice of the date, time, and location of  the public meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Present the proposal to the community. At the public meeting,  the Postal Service will identify the need, e.g., to replace an expiring  lease or to serve a new population center; identify the tentative  decision, e.g., to relocate retail services or add a retail service  facility; outline the proposal to meet the need; invite questions;  solicit written input on the proposal; and provide an address to which  the community and local officials may send written appeals of the  tentative decision and comments on the proposal for a period of 30 days  following the public meeting. Under exceptional circumstances that would  prevent a Postal Service representative from attending or conducting a  public meeting to present the proposal within a reasonable time, the  Postal Service, in lieu of a public meeting, will mail written  notification of the tentative decision and the proposal to customers  within the community and post a notice of the proposal in the retail  service facility that would be affected by the proposal, seeking their  written input on the proposal and providing an address to which the  community and local officials may send written appeals of the tentative  decision and comments on the proposal during the 30 days following that  notification. An example of exceptional circumstances would be a  proposal that would be implemented in a sparsely populated area remote  from the seat of local government or any forum where the public meeting  reasonably could be held.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the proposal concerns relocation, then the Postal Service  will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Discuss the reasons for relocating;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify the site or area, or both, to which the Postal Service  anticipates relocating the retail services; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Describe the anticipated size of the retail service facility for  the relocated retail services, and the anticipated services to be  offered at that site or in that area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Postal Service may identify more than one potential  relocation site and/or area, for example, when the Postal Service has  not selected among competing sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the proposal concerns adding a new retail service  facility for a community, then the Postal Service will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Discuss the reasons for the addition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify the site or area, or both, to which the Postal Service  anticipates adding the retail service facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Describe the anticipated size of the added retail service  facility, and the anticipated services to be offered; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Outline any anticipated construction (e.g., of a stand-alone  building or interior improvements to an existing building (or portion  thereof) that will be leased by the Postal Service).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Postal Service may identify more than one potential site  and/or area, for example, when the Postal Service has not selected yet  among competing sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Consider comments and appeals. After the 30-day comment and  appeal period, the Postal Service will consider the comments and appeals  received that identify reasons why the Postal Service's tentative  decision and proposal (e.g., to relocate to the selected site, or to add  a new retail service facility) is, or is not, the optimal solution for  the identified need. Following that consideration, the Postal Service  will make a final decision to proceed with, modify, or cancel the  proposal. The Postal Service then will inform   local officials in writing of its final decision and send an initial  news release announcing the final decision to local news media. If the  community has a retail service facility, then the Postal Service also  will post a copy of the information given to local officials or the news  release in the public lobby of that retail service facility. The Postal  Service then will implement the final decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Identify any new site or area. After the public meeting under  paragraph (c)(3) of this section, if the Postal Service decides to use a  site or area that it did not identify at the public meeting, and this  section applies with respect to that new site or area, then the Postal  Service will undertake the steps in paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of  this section with regard to the new site or area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect on other obligations and policies. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Nothing in this  section shall add to, reduce, or otherwise modify the Postal Service's  legal obligations or policies for compliance with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C.  470, Executive Order 12072, and Executive Order 13006;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 39 U.S.C. 404(d) and 39 CFR 241.3; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 39 U.S.C. 409(f);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> These are independent policies or obligations of the Postal  Service that are not dependent upon a relocation or addition of a retail  service facility.
