This shutoff valve may also serve as the fire wall shutoff valve required if the line between the valve and the engine compartment does not contain more than one quart of fuel (or any greater amount shown to be safe) that can escape into the engine compartment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least two vents arranged to minimize the probability of both vents becoming obstructed simultaneously.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Filler caps designed to minimize the probability of incorrect installation or inflight loss.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A fuel system in which those parts of the system from each tank outlet to any engine are independent of each part of the system supplying fuel to any other engine.
