                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assistant Secretary responsibility. A State's performance under a Cooperative Agreement will be regularly monitored and evaluated by the Assistant Secretary as part of a systematic Federal plan for this activity. The Assistant Secretary may require changes as a result of these evaluations to foster conformance with consultation policy. If the State policies or practices which require change are such that the State's assurance of correction of serious hazards and of the effectiveness of employers' safety and health programs is in doubt, the Assistant Secretary may, pending the completion of the changes, suspend recognition of a State's consultative visits as a basis for exemption from compliance inspection as permitted under Sec. 1908.7(b)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consultant performance-(1) State activity. The State shall establish and maintain an organized consultant performance monitoring system under the Cooperative Agreement:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State activity.

These visits shall be conducted only with the expressed permission of the employer who requests the onsite consultative visit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The State will report quarterly to the RA on system operations, including copies of accompanied visit reports completed that quarter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal activity.

For Federal monitoring and evaluation purposes, the State shall compile and submit such factual and statistical data in the format and at the frequency required by the Assistant Secretary. The State shall prepare and submit to the RA any narrative reports, including copies of written reports to employers as may be required by the Assistant Secretary.
