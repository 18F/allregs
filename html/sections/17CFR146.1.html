L. 93-579, 5 U.S.C. 552a). These rules apply to all records maintained by this Commission which are not excepted or exempted as set forth in Sec. 146.12, insofar as they contain personal information concerning an individual, identify that individual by name or other symbol and are contained in a system of records from which information is retrieved by the individual's name or identifying symbol. Among the primary purposes of these rules are to permit individuals to determine whether information about them is contained in Commission files and, if so, to obtain access to that information; to establish procedures whereby individuals may have inaccurate and incomplete information corrected; and, to restrict access by unauthorized persons to that information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In this part the Commission is also exempting certain Commission systems of records from some of the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 that would otherwise be applicable to those systems. These exemptions are authorized under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k).</p>
