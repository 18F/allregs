                            <p class="depth0">After the matter is called for hearing and before the date set for  the hearing to begin, any person may petition for leave to intervene.  The petition is to be served on the administrative law judge. The  petition must set forth the reasons why the petitioner alleges he/she is  entitled to intervene. The petition must be served on all parties in  accordance with Sec. 386.31. Any party may file a response within 10  days of service of the petition. The administrative law judge shall then  determine whether to permit or deny the petition. The petition will be  allowed if the administrative law judge determines that the final  decision could directly and adversely affect the petitioner or the class  he/she represents, and if the petitioner may contribute materially to  the disposition of the proceedings and his/her interest is not  adequately represented by existing parties. Once admitted, a petitioner  is a party for the purpose of all subsequent proceedings.</p>
