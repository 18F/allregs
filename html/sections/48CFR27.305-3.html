                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agencies are responsible for implementing procedures necessary  to protect the Government's interest in subject inventions. When the  Government acquires the entire right, title, and interest in an  invention by contract, the chain of title from the inventor to the  Government shall be clearly established. This is normally accomplished  by an assignment either from each inventor to the contractor and   from the contractor to the Government, or from the inventor to the  Government with the consent of the contractor. When the Government's  rights are limited to a license, there should be a confirmatory  instrument to that effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agencies may, by supplemental instructions, develop suitable  assignments, licenses, and other papers evidencing any rights of the  Government in patents or patents applications. These instruments should  be recorded in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (see Executive Order  9424, Establishing in the United States Patent Office a Register of  Government Interests in Patents and Applications for Patents, (February  18, 1944).</p>
