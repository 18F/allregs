                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Material change in circumstances. A debtor who owes a Treasury debt may, at any time, request a special review by the applicable Treasury entity of the amount of any offset, administrative wage garnishment, or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances beyond the control of the debtor such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inability to pay. For purposes of this section, in determining whether an involuntary or voluntary payment would prevent the debtor from meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the debtor shall submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the debtor, his or her spouse, and dependents, indicating:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Income from all sources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assets;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Liabilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Number of dependents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Medical expenses; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Exceptional expenses, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternative payment arrangement. If the debtor requests a special review under this section, the debtor shall submit an alternative proposed payment schedule and a statement to the Treasury entity collecting the debt, with supporting documents, showing why the current offset, garnishment or repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Treasury entity will evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Treasury entity shall notify the debtor in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset, garnishment, or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule, the Treasury entity will notify the appropriate agency or other persons about the new terms.</p>
