                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must decide  on the appropriate instrument for the Federal award (i.e., grant  agreement, cooperative agreement, or contract) in accordance with the  Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fixed Amount Awards. In addition to the options described in  paragraph (a) of this section, Federal awarding agencies, or pass- through entities as permitted in Sec. 200.332 Fixed amount subawards,  may use fixed amount awards (see Sec. 200.45 Fixed amount awards) to  which the following conditions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Federal award amount is negotiated using the cost principles  (or other pricing information) as a guide. The Federal awarding agency  or pass-through entity may use fixed amount awards if the project scope  is specific and if adequate cost, historical, or unit pricing data is  available to establish a fixed amount award based on a reasonable  estimate of actual cost. Payments are based on meeting specific  requirements of the Federal award. Accountability is based on  performance and results. Except in the case of termination before  completion of the Federal award, there is no governmental review of the  actual costs incurred by the non-Federal entity in performance of the  award. Some of the ways in which the Federal award may be paid include,  but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In several partial payments, the amount of each agreed upon in  advance, and the ``milestone'' or event triggering the payment also  agreed upon in advance, and set forth in the Federal award;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On a unit price basis, for a defined unit or units, at a  defined price or prices, agreed to in advance of performance of the  Federal award and set forth in the Federal award; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In one payment at Federal award completion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A fixed amount award cannot be used in programs which require  mandatory cost sharing or match.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The non-Federal entity must certify in writing to the Federal  awarding agency or pass-through entity at the end of the Federal award  that the project or activity was completed or the level of effort was  expended. If the required level of activity or effort was not carried  out, the amount of the Federal award must be adjusted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Periodic reports may be established for each Federal award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Changes in principal investigator, project leader, project  partner, or scope of effort must receive the prior written approval of  the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.
