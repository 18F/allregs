                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Measurements of the radiated emissions of a TV interface device  shall be conducted with the output terminal(s) of the device terminated  by a resistance equal to the rated output impedance. The emanations of a  TV interface device incorporating an intentional radiator shall not  exceed the limits in Sec. 15.109 or subpart C of this part, whichever is  higher for each frequency. Where it is possible to determine which  portion of the device is contributing a particular radio frequency  emission, the emissions from the TV interface device portion shall  comply with the emission limits in Sec. 15.109, and the emissions from  the intentional radiator shall comply with subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Output signal limits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At any RF output terminal, the maximum measured RMS voltage, in  microvolts, corresponding to the peak envelope power of the modulated  signal during maximum amplitude peaks across a resistance (R in ohms)  matching the rated output impedance of the TV interface device, shall  not exceed the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a cable system terminal device or a TV interface device used  with a master antenna, 692.8 times the square root of (R) for the video  signal and 155 times the square root of (R) for the audio signal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For all other TV interface devices, 346.4 times the square root  of (R) for the video signal and 77.5 times the square root of (R) for  the audio signal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At any RF output terminal, the maximum measured RMS voltage, in  microvolts, corresponding to the peak envelope power of the modulated  signal   during maximum amplitude peaks across a resistance (R in ohms) matching  the rated output impedance of the TV interface device, of any emission  appearing on frequencies removed by more than 4.6 MHz below or 7.4 MHz  above the video carrier frequency on which the TV interface device is  operated shall not exceed the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a cable system terminal device or a TV interface device used  with a master antenna, 692.8 times the square root of (R).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For all other TV interface devices, 10.95 times the square root  of (R).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term master antenna used in this section refers to TV  interface devices employed for central distribution of television or  other video signals within a building. Such TV interface devices must be  designed to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Distribute multiple television signals at the same time;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Distribute such signals by cable to outlets or TV receivers in  multiple rooms in the building in which the TV interface devices are  installed; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Distribute all over-the-air or cable signals.</p><p class="depth4">Note: Cable-ready video cassette recorders continue to be subject to  the provisions for general TV interface devices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A TV interface device shall be equipped with a transfer switch  for connecting the antenna terminals of a receiver selectively either to  the receiving antenna or to the radio frequency output of the TV  interface device, subject to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When measured in any of its set positions, transfer switches  shall comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a cable system terminal device or a TV interface device  equipped for use with a cable system or a master antenna, as defined in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the isolation between the antenna and  cable input terminals shall be at least 80 dB from 54 MHz to 216 MHz, at  least 60 dB from 216 MHz to 550 MHz and at least 55 dB from 550 MHz to  806 MHz. The 80 dB standard applies at 216 MHz and the 60 dB standard  applies at 550 MHz. In the case of a transfer switch requiring a power  source, the required isolation shall be maintained in the event the  device is not connected to a power source or power is interrupted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For all other TV interface devices, the maximum voltage,  corresponding to the peak envelope power of the modulated video signal  during maximum amplitude peaks, in microvolts, appearing at the  receiving antenna input terminals when terminated with a resistance (R  in ohms) matching the rated impedance of the antenna input of the  switch, shall not exceed 0.346 times the square root of (R).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Measurement to determine compliance with the transfer switch  limits shall be made using a connecting cable, where required, between  the TV interface device and the transfer switch of the type and length:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Provided with the TV interface device,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Recommended in the instruction manual, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Normally employed by the consumer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A TV interface device shall be designed and constructed, to the  extent practicable, so as to preclude the possibility that the consumer  may inadvertently attach the output of the device to the receiving  antenna, if any, without first going through the transfer switch.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A transfer switch is not required for a TV interface device  that, when connected, results in the user no longer having any need to  receive standard over-the-air broadcast signals via a separate antenna.  A transfer switch is not required to be marketed with a cable system  terminal device unless that device provides for the connection of an  external antenna. A transfer switch is not required for a device that is  intended to be used as an accessory to an authorized TV interface  device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An actual transfer switch is not required for a TV interface  device, including a cable system terminal device, that has an antenna  input terminal(s); provided, the circuitry following the antenna input  terminal(s) has sufficient bandwidth to allow the reception of all TV  broadcast channels authorized under part 73 of this chapter and: For a  cable system terminal device that can alternate between the reception of  cable television service and an antenna, compliance with the isolation  requirement specified in paragraph   (c)(1)(i) of this section can be demonstrated; and, for all other TV  interface devices, the maximum voltage appearing at the antenna  terminal(s) does not exceed the limit in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a transfer switch is not required, the following label shall  be used in addition to the label shown in Sec. 15.19(a):</p><p class="depth3">This device is intended to be attached to a receiver that is not  used to receive over-the-air broadcast signals. Connection of this  device in any other fashion may cause harmful interference to radio  communications and is in violation of the FCC Rules, part 15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A TV interface device, including a cable system terminal device,  shall incorporate circuitry to automatically prevent emanations from the  device from exceeding the technical specifications in this part. These  circuits shall be adequate to accomplish their functions when the TV  interface device is presented, if applicable, with video input signal  levels in the range of one to five volts; this requirement is not  applicable to a TV interface device that uses a built-in signal source  and has no provisions for the connection of an external signal source.  For devices that contain provisions for an external signal source but do  not contain provisions for the input of an external baseband signal,  e.g., some cable system terminal devices, compliance with the provisions  of this paragraph shall be demonstrated with a radio frequency input  signal of 0 to 25 dBmV.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For cable system terminal devices and TV interface devices used  with a master antenna, as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section,  the holder of the grant of authorization shall specify in the  instruction manual or pamphlet, if a manual is not provided, the types  of wires or coaxial cables necessary to ensure that the unit complies  with the requirements of this part. The holder of the grant of  authorization must comply with the provisions of Sec. 15.27. For all  other TV interface devices, the wires or coaxial cables used to couple  the output signals to the TV receiver shall be provided by the  responsible party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A TV interface device which is submitted to the Commission as a  composite device in a single enclosure containing a RF modulator, video  source and other component devices shall be submitted on a single  application (FCC Form 731) and shall be authorized as a single device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An external device or accessory that is intended to be attached  to a TV interface device shall comply with the technical and  administrative requirements set out in the rules under which it  operates. For example, a personal computer must be certificated to show  compliance with the regulations for digital devices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Stand-alone switches used to alternate between cable service and  an antenna shall provide isolation between the antenna and cable input  terminals that is at least 80 dB from 54 MHz to 216 MHz, at least 60 dB  from 216 MHz to 550 MHz and at least 55 dB from 550 MHz to 806 MHz. The  80 dB standard applies at 216 MHz and the 60 dB standard applies at 550  MHz. In the case of stand-alone switches requiring a power source, the  required isolation shall be maintained in the event the device is not  connected to a power source or power is interrupted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Switches and other devices intended to be used to by-pass the  processing circuitry of a cable system terminal device, whether internal  to such a terminal device or a stand-alone unit, shall not attenuate the  input signal more than 6 dB from 54 MHz to 550 MHz, or more than 8 dB  from 550 MHz to 804 MHz. The 6 dB standard applies at 550 MHz.  [54 FR 17714, Apr. 25, 1989, as amended at 57 FR 33448, July 29, 1992;  59 FR 25341, May 16, 1994; 61 FR 18509, Apr. 26, 1996; 77 FR 4913, Feb.  1, 2012]</p>
