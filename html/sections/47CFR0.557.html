                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individuals have 30 days from the date of the determination not to amend a record consistent with their request to seek further administrative review by the full Commisison. Such a request shall be in writing and should be addressed to either the system manager who made the initial adverse decision, or, in the case of official personnel records of active FCC employees, to the Assistant Director for Work Force Information, Compliance and Investigations Group, Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC 20415. Any request for administrative review must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clearly identify the questions presented for review (e.g., whether the record information in question is, in fact, accurate; whether information subject to a request to delete is relevant and necessary to the purpose for which it is maintained);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specify with particularity why the decision reached by the system manager is erroneous or inequitable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Clearly state how the record should be amended or corrected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commission shall conduct an independent review of the record in controversy using the standards of review set out in Sec. 0.556(d). It may seek such additional information as is necessary to make its determination. Final administrative review shall be completed not later than 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) from the date on which the individual requests such review unless the Chairman determines that a fair and equitable review cannot be made within the 30 day period. In such event, the individual will be informed in writing of the reasons for the delay and the approximate date on which the review is expected to be completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If upon review of the record in controversy the Commission agrees with the individual that the requested amendment is warranted, the Commission will proceed in accordance with Sec. 0.556(c)(1) (i) through (iii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If after the review, the Commission also refuses to amend the record as requested, it shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notify the individual in writing of its refusal and the reasons therefore;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Advise the individual that a concise statement of the reasons for disagreeing with the decision of the Commisison may be filed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inform the individual:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That such a statement should be signed and addressed to the system manager having custody of the record in question;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the statement will be made available to any one to whom the record is subsequently disclosed together with, at the Commission's discretion, a summary of its reasons for refusing to amend the record; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That prior recipients of the record will be provided a copy of the statement of dispute to the extent that an accounting of such disclosures is maintained; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Advise the individual that judicial review of the Commisison's decision not to amend the record in any district court of the United States is available.
