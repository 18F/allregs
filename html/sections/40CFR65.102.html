The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section do not apply to the performance standards of Sec. 65.111(b) for pressure relief devices or Sec. 65.112(f) for compressors operating under the alternative compressor standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requests by owners or operators. An owner or operator may request a determination of alternative means of emission limitation to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 65.106 through 65.115 as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. If the Administrator makes a determination that a means of emission limitation is a permissible alternative, the owner or operator shall either comply with the alternative or comply with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 65.106 through 65.115.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests by manufacturers of equipment. (1) Manufacturers of equipment used to control equipment leaks of a regulated material may apply to the Administrator for approval of an alternative means of emission limitation that achieves a reduction in emissions of the regulated material equivalent to the reduction achieved by the equipment, design, and operational requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturers of equipment used to control equipment leaks of a regulated material may apply to the Administrator for approval of an alternative means of emission limitation that achieves a reduction in emissions of the regulated material equivalent to the reduction achieved by the equipment, design, and operational requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator will grant permission according to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation.
