                            <p class="depth0">This section identifies activities with respect to two chemical substances which are prohibited and requires that warnings and instructions accompany the substances when distributed in commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Chemical substances subject to this section. The following chemical substances, referred to by their premanufacture notice numbers and generic chemical names, are subject to this section:</p><p class="depth2">P-83-1005, triethanolamine salt of tricarboxylic acid; and</p><p class="depth2">P-83-1062, tricarboxylic acid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. Definitions in section 3 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 2602, apply to this section unless otherwise specified in this paragraph. In addition, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The terms Act, article, byproducts, chemical substance, commerce, imported, impurity, Inventory, manufacture or import for commercial purposes, manufacture solely for export, manufacturer, new chemical substance, person, process, processor, and small quantities solely for research and development have the same meaning as in Sec. 720.3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Metalworking fluid means a liquid of any viscosity or color containing intentionally added water used in metal machining operations for the purpose of cooling or lubricating.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nitrosating agent means any substance that has the potential to transfer a nitrosyl group (--NO) to a secondary or tertiary amine to form the corresponding nitrosamine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use limitations. (1) Any person producing a metalworking fluid, or a product which could be used in or as a metalworking fluid, which includes as one of its components P-83-1005 is prohibited from adding any nitrosating agent to the metalworking fluid or product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person producing a metalworking fluid, or a product which could be used in or as a metalworking fluid, which includes as one of its components P-83-1005 is prohibited from adding any nitrosating agent to the metalworking fluid or product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person using as metalworking fluid a product containing P-83-1005 is prohibited from adding any nitrosating agent to the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Warnings and instructions. (1) Any person who distributes in commerce P-83-1005 in a metalworking fluid, or in any form in which it could be used as a component of a metalworking fluid, must sent to each recipient of P-83-1005 and confirm receipt prior to the first shipment to that person:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person who distributes in commerce P-83-1005 in a metalworking fluid, or in any form in which it could be used as a component of a metalworking fluid, must sent to each recipient of P-83-1005 and confirm receipt prior to the first shipment to that person:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A letter that includes the following statements:</p><p class="depth4">A substance, identified generically as triethanolamine salt, of tricarboxylic acid, contained in the product (insert distributor's trade name or other identifier for product containing P-83-1005) has been regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, at 40 CFR 747.200, as published in the Federal Register of January 23, 1984. A copy of the regulation is enclosed. The regulation prohibits the addition of any nitrosating agent, including nitrites, to the triethanolamine salt of tricarboxylic acid, when the substance is or could be used in metalworking fluids. The addition of nitrites or other nitrosating agents to this substance leads to formation of a substance known to cause cancer in laboratory animals. The triethanolamine salt of the tricarboxylic acid, has been specifically designed to be used without nitrites. Consult the enclosed regulation for further information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of this rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person who distributes in commerce a metalworking fluid containing P-83-1005 must affix to each container containing the fluid a label that includes, in letters no smaller than ten point type, the following statement:</p><p class="depth3">WARNING!
