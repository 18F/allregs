                                Sec. 390.447  Appraisal policies and practices of State savings
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. The soundness of a State savings association's mortgage loans and real estate investments, and those of its subsidiary(ies), depends to a great extent upon the adequacy of the loan underwriting used to support these transactions. An appraisal standard is one of several critical components of a sound underwriting policy because appraisal reports contain estimates of the value of collateral held or assets owned. This section sets forth the responsibilities of management to develop, implement, and maintain appraisal standards in determining compliance with the appraisal requirements of Sec. 390.350.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition. For purposes of this section, management means: the directors and officers of a State savings association or subsidiary(ies) of such State savings association as those terms are defined in Sec. Sec. 390.291 and 390.302, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responsibilities of management. An appraisal is a critical component of the loan underwriting or real estate investment decision. Therefore, management shall develop, implement, and maintain appraisal policies to ensure that appraisals reflect professional competence and to facilitate the reporting of estimates of market value upon which State savings associations may rely to make lending decisions. To achieve these results:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Management shall develop written appraisal policies, subject to formal adoption by the State savings association's board of directors, that it shall implement in consultation with other appropriate personnel. These policies shall ensure that adequate appraisals are obtained and proper appraisal procedures are followed consistent with the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Management shall develop and adopt guidelines and institute procedures pertaining to the hiring of appraisers to perform appraisal services for the State savings association consistent with the requirements of this subpart. These guidelines shall set forth specific factors to be considered by management including, but not limited to, an appraiser's State certification or licensing, professional education, and type of experience. An appraiser's membership in professional appraisal organizations may be considered consistent with the requirements of subpart X.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Management shall review on an annual basis the performance of all approved appraisers used within the preceding 12-month period for compliance with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State savings association's appraisal policies and procedures; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The reasonableness of the value estimates reported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exemptions. The requirements of Sec. 390.443(b) through (d) shall not apply

with respect to appraisals on nonresidential properties prepared on form reports approved by the FDIC and completed in accordance with the applicable instructional booklet.</p>
