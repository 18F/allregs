                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis for sanction. (1) A State agency may recommend that CMS  impose the denial of payment sanction specified in paragraph (e) of this  section on an MCO with a contract under this part if the agency  determines that the MCO acts or fails to act as specified in Sec.   438.700(b)(1) through (b)(6).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect of an Agency Determination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State agency's  determination becomes CMS's determination for purposes of section  1903(m)(5)(A) of the Act unless CMS reverses or modifies it within 15  days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the agency decides to recommend imposing the sanction  described in paragraph (e) of this section, this recommendation becomes  CMS's decision, for purposes of section 1903(m)(5)(B)(ii) of the Act,  unless CMS rejects this recommendation within 15 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of sanction. If the State agency's determination becomes  CMS's determination under section (b)(2), the State agency takes the  following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gives the MCO written notice of the nature and basis of the  proposed sanction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allows the MCO 15 days from the date it receives the notice to  provide evidence that it has not acted or failed to act in the manner  that is the basis for the recommended sanction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> May extend the initial 15-day period for an additional 15 days  if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> the MCO submits a written request that includes a credible  explanation of why it needs additional time;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> the request is received by CMS before the end of the initial  period; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> CMS has not determined that the MCO's conduct poses a threat  to an enrollee's health or safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Informal reconsideration. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the MCO submits a timely  response to the notice of sanction, the State agency--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conducts an informal reconsideration that includes review of the  evidence by a State agency official who   did not participate in the original recommendation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Gives the MCO a concise written decision setting forth the  factual and legal basis for the decision; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Forwards the decision to CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency decision under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section  becomes CMS's decision unless CMS reverses or modifies the decision  within 15 days from date of receipt by CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If CMS reverses or modifies the State agency decision, the  agency sends the MCO a copy of CMS's decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Denial of payment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS, based upon the recommendation of the  agency, may deny payment to the State for new enrollees of the HMO under  section 1903(m)(5)(B)(ii) of the Act in the following situations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a CMS determination that an MCO has acted or failed to act,  as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of Sec.  438.700, is  affirmed on review under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the CMS determination is not timely contested by the MCO  under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under Sec.  438.726(b), CMS's denial of payment for new  enrollees automatically results in a denial of agency payments to the  HMO for the same enrollees. (A new enrollee is an enrollee that applies  for enrollment after the effective date in paragraph (f)(1) of this  section.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective date of sanction. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the MCO does not seek  reconsideration, a sanction is effective 15 days after the date the MCO  is notified under paragraph (b) of this section of the decision to  impose the sanction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the MCO seeks reconsideration, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the  sanction is effective on the date specified in CMS's reconsideration  notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> CMS's role. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS retains the right to independently perform  the functions assigned to the State agency under paragraphs (a) through  (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the same time that the agency sends notice to the MCO under  paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, CMS forwards a copy of the notice  to the OIG.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CMS conveys the determination described in paragraph (b) of this  section to the OIG for consideration of possible imposition of civil  money penalties under section 1903(m)(5)(A) of the Act and part 1003 of  this title. In accordance with the provisions of part 1003, the OIG may  impose civil money penalties on the MCO in addition to, or in place of,  the sanctions that may be imposed under this section.</p>
