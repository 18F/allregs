Except as modified by this  section, the reduction in force regulations in part 351 of this chapter  apply to administrative law judges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of retention standing. In determining retention  standing in a reduction in force, each agency lists its administrative  law judges by group and subgroup according to tenure of employment,  veterans' preference, and service date as outlined in part 351 of this  chapter. Because administrative law judges are not given performance  ratings (see Sec. 930.206), the provisions in part 351 of this chapter  referring to the effect of performance ratings on retention standing are  not applicable to administrative law judges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Placement assistance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An administrative law judge who is  reached in an agency's reduction in force and receives a notification of  separation is eligible for placement assistance under the agency's  reemployment priority list established and maintained in accordance with  subpart B of part 330 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An administrative law judge who is reached by an agency in a  reduction in force and who is notified of being separated, furloughed  for more than 30 days, or demoted, is entitled to have his or her name  placed on OPM's administrative law judge priority referral list for the  level in which last served and for all lower levels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To have his or her name placed on the OPM priority referral  list, a displaced administrative law judge must provide OPM with a  request for priority referral placement, a resume or   equivalent, a list of acceptable geographical locations, and a copy of  the reduction in force notice at any time after the receipt of the  specific reduction in force notice, but not later than 90 days after the  date of separation, furlough for more than 30 days, or demotion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Eligibility on the OPM priority referral list expires 2 years  after the effective date of the reduction in force action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Referral and selection of administrative law judges are made  without regard to selective certification or special qualification  procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Termination of eligibility on the OPM priority referral list  takes place when an administrative law judge submits a written request  to terminate eligibility, accepts a permanent full-time administrative  law judge position, or declines one full-time employment offer as an  administrative law judge at or above the level held when reached for  reduction in force at geographic locations indicated as acceptable under  paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When there is no administrative law judge available on the  agency's reemployment priority list, an agency may fill a vacant  administrative law judge position only from OPM's priority referral  list, unless the agency obtains prior approval from OPM to fill the  vacant position through competitive examining, promotion, transfer,  reassignment, or reinstatement procedures. OPM will grant such approvals  only under extraordinary circumstances. The agency must demonstrate that  the potential administrative law judge candidate possesses experience  and qualifications superior to any available displaced administrative  law judge on OPM's priority referral list.</p>
