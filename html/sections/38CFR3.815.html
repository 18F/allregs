                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Monthly monetary allowance--(1) General. VA will pay a monthly monetary allowance under subchapter II of 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 to or for an individual whose biological mother is or was a Vietnam veteran and who VA has determined to have disability resulting from one or more covered birth defects. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the amount of the monetary allowance paid will be based upon the level of such disability suffered by the individual, as determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. VA will pay a monthly monetary allowance under subchapter II of 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 to or for an individual whose biological mother is or was a Vietnam veteran and who VA has determined to have disability resulting from one or more covered birth defects. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the amount of the monetary allowance paid will be based upon the level of such disability suffered by the individual, as determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Affirmative evidence of cause other than mother's service during Vietnam era. No monetary allowance will be provided under this section based on a particular birth defect of an individual in any case where affirmative evidence establishes that the birth defect results from a cause other than the active military, naval, or air service of the individual's mother during the Vietnam era and, in determining the level of disability for an individual with more than one birth defect, the particular defect resulting from other causes will be excluded from consideration. This will not prevent VA from paying a monetary allowance under this section for other birth defects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nonduplication; spina bifida. In the case of an individual whose only covered birth defect is spina bifida, a monetary allowance will be paid under Sec.  3.814, and not under this section, nor will the individual be evaluated for disability under this section. In the case of an individual who has spina bifida and one or more additional covered birth defects, a monetary allowance will be paid under this section and the amount of the monetary allowance will be not less than the amount the individual would receive if his or her only covered birth defect were spina bifida.

If, but for the individual's one or more additional covered birth defects, the monetary allowance payable to or for the individual would be based on an evaluation at Level I, II, or III, respectively, under Sec.  3.814(d), the evaluation of the individual's level of disability under paragraph (e) of this section will be not less than Level II, III, or IV, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No effect on other VA benefits. Receipt of a monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 will not affect the right of the individual, or the right of any person based on the individual's relationship to that person, to receive any other benefit to which the individual, or that person, may be entitled under any law administered by VA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions--(1) Vietnam veteran. For the purposes of this section, the term Vietnam veteran means a person who performed active military, naval, or air service in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on February 28, 1961, and ending on May 7, 1975, without regard to the characterization of the person's service. Service in the Republic of Vietnam includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vietnam veteran. For the purposes of this section, the term Vietnam veteran means a person who performed active military, naval, or air service in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on February 28, 1961, and ending on May 7, 1975, without regard to the characterization of the person's service.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec.  3.204(a)(1), VA will require the types of evidence specified in Sec. Sec.  3.209 and 3.210 sufficient to establish that a person is the biological son or daughter of a Vietnam veteran.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Covered birth defect. For the purposes of this section, the term covered birth defect means any birth defect identified by VA as a birth defect that is associated with the service of women Vietnam veterans in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on February 28, 1961, and ending on May 7, 1975, and that has resulted, or may result, in permanent physical or mental disability. However, the term covered birth defect does not include a condition due to a:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Familial disorder;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Birth-related injury; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fetal or neonatal infirmity with well-established causes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Identification of covered birth defects.

Whenever VA determines, upon receipt of competent medical evidence, that an individual has one or more covered birth defects, VA will determine the level of disability currently resulting, in combination, from the covered birth defects and associated disabilities. No monetary allowance will be payable under this section if VA determines under this paragraph that an individual has no current disability resulting from the covered birth defects, unless VA determines that the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section are for application. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, VA will determine the level of disability as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Levels of disability.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Level 0. The individual has no current disability resulting from covered birth defects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Level I.

Except as provided in Sec.  3.114(a) or paragraph (i)(1) or (2) of this section, VA will award the monetary allowance under subchapter II of 38 U.S.C. chapter 18, for an individual with disability resulting from one or more covered birth defects, based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase, as of the date VA received the claim (or the date of birth if the claim is received within one year of that date), the date entitlement arose, or December 1, 2001, whichever is latest. Subject to the condition that no benefits may be paid for any period prior to December 1, 2001:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> VA will increase benefits as of the earliest date the evidence establishes that the level of severity increased, but only if the beneficiary applies for an increase within one year of that date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a claimant reopens a previously disallowed claim based on corrected military records, VA will award the benefit from the latest of the following dates: the date the veteran or beneficiary applied for a correction of the military records; the date the disallowed claim was filed; or, the date one year before the date of receipt of the reopened claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Reductions and discontinuances.
