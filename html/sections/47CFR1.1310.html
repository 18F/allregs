                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Specific absorption rate (SAR) shall be used to evaluate the  environmental impact of human exposure to radiofrequency (RF) radiation  as specified in Sec. 1.1307(b) within the frequency range of 100 kHz to  6 GHz (inclusive).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The SAR limits for occupational/controlled exposure are 0.4 W/ kg, as averaged over the whole body, and a peak spatial-average SAR of 8  W/kg, averaged over any 1 gram of tissue (defined as a tissue volume in  the shape of a cube). Exceptions are the parts of the human body treated  as extremities, such as hands, wrists, feet, ankles, and pinnae, where  the peak spatial-average SAR limit for occupational/controlled exposure  is 20 W/kg, averaged over any 10 grams of tissue (defined as a tissue  volume in the shape of a cube). Exposure may be averaged over a time  period not to exceed 6 minutes to determine compliance with  occupational/controlled SAR limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The SAR limits for general population/uncontrolled exposure are  0.08 W/kg, as averaged over the whole body, and a peak spatial-average  SAR of 1.6 W/kg, averaged over any 1 gram of tissue (defined as a tissue  volume in the shape of a cube). Exceptions are the parts of the human  body treated as extremities, such as hands, wrists, feet, ankles, and  pinnae, where the peak spatial-average SAR limit is 4 W/kg, averaged  over any 10 grams of tissue (defined as a tissue volume in the shape of  a cube). Exposure may be averaged over a time period not to exceed 30  minutes to determine compliance with general population/uncontrolled SAR  limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evaluation with respect to the SAR limits in this section and  in Sec. 2.1093 of this chapter must demonstrate compliance with both the  whole-body and peak spatial-average limits using technically supportable  methods and exposure conditions in advance of authorization (licensing  or equipment certification) and in a manner that permits independent  assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At operating frequencies less than or equal to 6 GHz, the limits  for maximum permissible exposure (MPE), derived from whole-body SAR  limits and listed in Table 1 of paragraph (e) of this section, may be  used instead of whole-body SAR limits as set forth in paragraph (a)  through (c) of this section to evaluate the environmental impact of  human exposure to RF radiation as specified in Sec. 1.1307(b), except  for portable devices as defined in Sec. 2.1093 as these evaluations  shall be performed according to the SAR provisions in Sec. 2.1093 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At operating frequencies above 6 GHz, the MPE limits shall be  used in all cases to evaluate the environmental impact of human exposure  to RF radiation as specified in Sec. 1.1307(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Both the MPE limits listed in Table 1 of paragraph (e) of this  section and the SAR limits as set forth in paragraph (a) through (c) of  this section and in Sec. 2.1093 of this chapter are for continuous  exposure, that is, for indefinite time periods. Exposure levels higher  than the limits are permitted for shorter exposure times, as long as the  average exposure over the specified averaging time in Table 1 is less  than the limits. Detailed information on our   policies regarding procedures for evaluating compliance with all of  these exposure limits can be found in the FCC's OET Bulletin 65,  ``Evaluating Compliance with FCC Guidelines for Human Exposure to  Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields,'' and in supplements to Bulletin  65, all available at the FCC's Internet Web site: http://www.fcc.gov/ oet/rfsafety.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraphs (a) through (d): SAR is a measure of the rate of  energy absorption due to exposure to RF electromagnetic energy. The SAR  limits to be used for evaluation are based generally on criteria  published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for  localized SAR in Sec. 4.2 of ``IEEE Standard for Safety Levels with  Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3  kHz to 300 GHz,'' ANSI/IEEE Std C95.1-1992, copyright 1992 by the  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., New York, New  York 10017. The criteria for SAR evaluation are similar to those  recommended by the National Council on Radiation Protection and  Measurements (NCRP) in ``Biological Effects and Exposure Criteria for  Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields,'' NCRP Report No. 86,  Sec. 17.4.5, copyright 1986 by NCRP, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. Limits  for whole body SAR and peak spatial-average SAR are based on  recommendations made in both of these documents. The MPE limits in Table  1 are based generally on criteria published by the NCRP in ``Biological  Effects and Exposure Criteria for Radiofrequency Electromagnetic  Fields,'' NCRP Report No. 86, Secs. 17.4.1, 17.4.1.1, 17.4.2 and 17.4.3,  copyright 1986 by NCRP, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. In the frequency range  from 100 MHz to 1500 MHz, these MPE exposure limits for field strength  and power density are also generally based on criteria recommended by  the ANSI in Sec. 4.1 of ``IEEE Standard for Safety Levels with Respect  to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to  300 GHz,'' ANSI/IEEE Std C95.1-1992, copyright 1992 by the Institute of  Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., New York, New York 10017.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Table 1 below sets forth limits for Maximum Permissible Exposure  (MPE) to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields.</p><p class="depth2">Table 1--Limits for Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Electric field  Magnetic field   Power density  Averaging time</p><p class="depth2">Frequency range (MHz)               strength (V/m)  strength (A/m)    (mW/cm \2\)      (minutes) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(A)</em> Limits for Occupational/Controlled Exposure ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0.3-3.0.........................................             614            1.63           * 100               6 3.0-30..........................................          1842/f          4.89/f     * 900/f \2\               6 30-300..........................................            61.4           0.163             1.0               6 300-1,500.......................................  ..............  ..............           f/300               6 1,500-100,000...................................  ..............  ..............               5               6 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(B)</em> Limits for General Population/Uncontrolled Exposure ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0.3-1.34........................................             614            1.63           * 100              30 1.34-30.........................................           824/f          2.19/f     * 180/f \2\              30 30-300..........................................            27.5           0.073             0.2              30 300-1,500.......................................  ..............  ..............          f/1500              30 1,500-100,000...................................  ..............  ..............             1.0              30 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- f = frequency in MHz * = Plane-wave equivalent power density</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Occupational/controlled exposure limits apply in situations in  which persons are exposed as a consequence of their employment provided  those persons are fully aware of the potential for exposure and can  exercise control over their exposure. Limits for occupational/controlled  exposure also apply in situations when a person is transient through a  location where occupational/controlled limits apply provided he or she  is made aware of the potential for exposure. The phrase fully aware in  the context of applying these exposure limits means that an exposed  person has received written and/or verbal information fully explaining  the potential for RF exposure resulting from his or her   employment. With the exception of transient persons, this phrase also  means that an exposed person has received appropriate training regarding  work practices relating to controlling or mitigating his or her  exposure. Such training is not required for transient persons, but they  must receive written and/or verbal information and notification (for  example, using signs) concerning their exposure potential and  appropriate means available to mitigate their exposure. The phrase  exercise control means that an exposed person is allowed to and knows  how to reduce or avoid exposure by administrative or engineering  controls and work practices, such as use of personal protective  equipment or time averaging of exposure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> General population/uncontrolled exposure limits apply in  situations in which the general public may be exposed, or in which  persons who are exposed as a consequence of their employment may not be  fully aware of the potential for exposure or cannot exercise control  over their exposure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Licensees and applicants are responsible for compliance with  both the occupational/controlled exposure limits and the general  population/uncontrolled exposure limits as they apply to transmitters  under their jurisdiction. Licensees and applicants should be aware that  the occupational/controlled exposure limits apply especially in  situations where workers may have access to areas in very close  proximity to antennas and access to the general public may be  restricted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In lieu of evaluation with the general population/uncontrolled  exposure limits, amateur licensees authorized under part 97 of this  chapter and members of his or her immediate household may be evaluated  with respect to the occupational/controlled exposure limits in this  section, provided appropriate training and information has been provided  to the amateur licensee and members of his/her household. Other nearby  persons who are not members of the amateur licensee's household must be  evaluated with respect to the general population/uncontrolled exposure  limits.  [78 FR 33650, June 4, 2013]</p>
