                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">As described in Sec.  144.6, injection wells are classified as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Class I. (1) Wells used by generators of hazardous waste or owners or operators of hazardous waste management facilities to inject hazardous waste beneath the lowermost formation containing, within one-quarter mile of the well bore, an underground source of drinking water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wells used by generators of hazardous waste or owners or operators of hazardous waste management facilities to inject hazardous waste beneath the lowermost formation containing, within one-quarter mile of the well bore, an underground source of drinking water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other industrial and municipal disposal wells which inject fluids beneath the lowermost formation containing, within one quarter mile of the well bore, an underground source of drinking water;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Radioactive waste disposal wells which inject fluids below the lowermost formation containing an underground source of drinking water within one quarter mile of the well bore.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Class II. Wells which inject fluids:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Which are brought to the surface in connection with natural gas storage operations, or conventional oil or natural gas production and may be commingled with waste waters from gas plants which are an integral part of production operations, unless those waters are classified as a hazardous waste at the time of injection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For enhanced recovery of oil or natural gas; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For storage of hydrocarbons which are liquid at standard temperature and pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Class III. Wells which inject fluids for extraction of minerals including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mining of sulfur by the Frasch process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In situ production of uranium or other metals; this category includes only in situ production from ore bodies which have not been conventionally mined. Solution mining of conventional mines such as stopes leaching is included in Class V.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Solution mining of salts or potash.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Class IV. (1) Wells used by generators of hazardous waste or of radioactive waste, by owners and operators of hazardous waste management facilities, or by owners or operators of radioactive waste disposal sites to dispose of hazardous waste or radioactive waste into a formation which within one quarter (\1/4\) mile of the well contains an underground source of drinking water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wells used by generators of hazardous waste or of radioactive waste, by owners and operators of hazardous waste management facilities, or by owners or operators of radioactive waste disposal sites to dispose of hazardous waste or radioactive waste into a formation which within one quarter (\1/4\) mile of the well contains an underground source of drinking water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Wells used by generators of hazardous waste or of radioactive waste, by owners and operators of hazardous waste management facilities, or by owners or operators of radioactive waste disposal sites to dispose of hazardous waste or radioactive waste above a formation which within one quarter (\1/4\) mile of the well contains an underground source of drinking water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Wells used by generators of hazardous waste or owners or operators of hazardous waste management facilities to dispose of hazardous waste, which cannot be classified under paragraph (a)(1) or (d)(1) and (2) of this section (e.g., wells used to dispose of hazardous waste into or above a formation which contains an aquifer which has been exempted pursuant to 40 CFR 146.04).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Class V. Injection wells not included in Class I, II, III, IV or VI. Typically, Class V wells are shallow wells

used to place a variety of fluids directly below the land surface. However, if the fluids you place in the ground qualify as a hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), your well is either a Class I or Class IV well, not a Class V well. Examples of Class V wells are described in Sec.  144.81.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Class VI. Wells used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide beneath the lowermost formation containing a USDW, except those wells that are experimental in nature; or, wells used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that have been granted a waiver of the injection depth requirements pursuant to requirements at Sec.  146.95 of this chapter; or, wells used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that have received an expansion to the areal extent of a existing Class II enhanced oil recovery or enhanced gas recovery aquifer exemption pursuant to Sec.  146.4 of this chapter and Sec.  144.7(d).
