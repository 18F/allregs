                            <p class="depth0">If applicable to the person for which the financial statements are filed, the following shall be set forth on the face of the appropriate statement or in appropriately captioned notes. The information shall be provided for each statement required to be filed, except that the information required by paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) shall be provided as of the most recent audited balance sheet being filed and for paragraph (j) as specified therein. When specific statements are presented separately, the pertinent notes shall accompany such statements unless cross-referencing is appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Principles of consolidation or combination. With regard to consolidated or combined financial statements, refer to Sec. Sec. 210.3A-01 to 3A-08 for requirements for supplemental information in notes to the financial statements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assets subject to lien. Assets mortgaged, pledged, or otherwise subject to lien, and the approximate amounts thereof, shall be designated and the obligations collateralized briefly identified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Defaults. The facts and amounts concerning any default in principal, interest, sinking fund, or redemption provisions with respect to any issue of securities or credit agreements, or any breach of covenant of a related indenture or agreement, which default or breach existed at the date of the most recent balance sheet being filed and which has not been subsequently cured,

shall be stated in the notes to the financial statements. If a default or breach exists but acceleration of the obligation has been waived for a stated period of time beyond the date of the most recent balance sheet being filed, state the amount of the obligation and the period of the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Preferred shares. (1) Aggregate preferences on involuntary liquidation, if other than par or stated value, shall be shown parenthetically in the equity section of the balance sheet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Aggregate preferences on involuntary liquidation, if other than par or stated value, shall be shown parenthetically in the equity section of the balance sheet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disclosure shall be made of any restriction upon retained earnings that arises from the fact that upon involuntary liquidation the aggregate preferences of the preferred shares exceeds the par or stated value of such shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Restrictions which limit the payment of dividends by the registrant. (1) Describe the most significant restrictions, other than as reported under paragraph (d) of this section, on the payment of dividends by the registrant, indicating their sources, their pertinent provisions, and the amount of retained earnings or net income restricted or free of restrictions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Describe the most significant restrictions, other than as reported under paragraph (d) of this section, on the payment of dividends by the registrant, indicating their sources, their pertinent provisions, and the amount of retained earnings or net income restricted or free of restrictions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disclose the amount of consolidated retained earnings which represents undistributed earnings of 50 percent or less owned persons accounted for by the equity method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The disclosures in paragraphs (e)(3) (i) and (ii) in this section shall be provided when the restricted net assets of consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries and the parent's equity in the undistributed earnings of 50 percent or less owned persons accounted for by the equity method together exceed 25 percent of consolidated net assets as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year. For purposes of this test, restricted net assets of subsidiaries shall mean that amount of the registrant's proportionate share of net assets (after intercompany eliminations) reflected in the balance sheets of its consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries as of the end of the most recent fiscal year which may not be transferred to the parent company in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends by the subsidiaries without the consent of a third party (i.e., lender, regulatory agency, foreign government, etc.). Not all limitations on transferability of assets are considered to be restrictions for purposes of this test, which considers only specific third party restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds outside of the entity. For example, the presence of subsidiary debt which is secured by certain of the subsidiary's assets does not constitute a restriction under this rule. However, if there are any loan provisions prohibiting dividend payments, loans or advances to the parent by a subsidiary, these are considered restrictions for purposes of computing restricted net assets. When a loan agreement requires that a subsidiary maintain certain working capital, net tangible asset, or net asset levels, or where formal compensating arrangements exist, there is considered to be a restriction under the rule because the lender's intent is normally to preclude the transfer by dividend or otherwise of funds to the parent company. Similarly, a provision which requires that a subsidiary reinvest all of its earnings is a restriction, since this precludes loans, advances or dividends in the amount of such undistributed earnings by the entity. Where restrictions on the amount of funds which may be loaned or advanced differ from the amount restricted as to transfer in the form of cash dividends, the amount least restrictive to the subsidiary shall be used. Redeemable preferred stocks (Sec. 210.5-02.27) and noncontrolling interests shall be deducted in computing net assets for purposes of this test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Describe the nature of any restrictions on the ability of consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated subsidiaries to transfer funds to the registrant in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances (i.e., borrowing arrangements, regulatory restraints, foreign government, etc.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disclose separately the amounts of such restricted net assets for unconsolidated subsidiaries and consolidated subsidiaries as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Significant changes in bonds, mortgages and similar debt. Any significant changes in the authorized or issued amounts of bonds, mortgages and similar debt since the date of the latest balance sheet being filed for a particular person or group shall be stated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Summarized financial information of subsidiaries not consolidated and 50 percent or less owned persons. (1) The summarized information as to assets, liabilities and results of operations as detailed in Sec. 210.1-02(bb) shall be presented in notes to the financial statements on an individual or group basis for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The summarized information as to assets, liabilities and results of operations as detailed in Sec. 210.1-02(bb) shall be presented in notes to the financial statements on an individual or group basis for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subsidiaries not consolidated; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For 50 percent or less owned persons accounted for by the equity method by the registrant or by a subsidiary of the registrant, if the criteria in Sec. 210.1-02(w) for a significant subsidiary are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Individually by any subsidiary not consolidated or any 50% or less owned person; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> On an aggregated basis by any combination of such subsidiaries and persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Summarized financial information shall be presented insofar as is practicable as of the same dates and for the same periods as the audited consolidated financial statements provided and shall include the disclosures prescribed by Sec. 210.1-02(bb). Summarized information of subsidiaries not consolidated shall not be combined for disclosure purposes with the summarized information of 50 percent or less owned persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Income tax expense. (1) Disclosure shall be made in the income statement or a note thereto, of (i) the components of income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) as either domestic or foreign; (ii) the components of income tax expense, including (A) taxes currently payable and (B) the net tax effects, as applicable, of timing differences (indicate separately the amount of the estimated tax effect of each of the various types of timing differences, such as depreciation, warranty costs, etc., where the amount of each such tax effect exceeds five percent of the amount computed by multiplying the income before tax by the applicable statutory Federal income tax rate; other differences may be combined.)</p><p class="depth0">Note: Amounts applicable to United States Federal income taxes, to foreign income taxes and the other income taxes shall be stated separately for each major component. Amounts applicable to foreign income (loss) and amounts applicable to foreign or other income taxes which are less than five percent of the total of income before taxes or the component of tax expense, respectively, need not be separately disclosed. For purposes of this rule, foreign income (loss) is defined as income (loss) generated from a registrant's foreign operations, i.e., operations that are located outside of the registrant's home country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provide a reconciliation between the amount of reported total income tax expense (benefit) and the amount computed by multiplying the income (loss) before tax by the applicable statutory Federal income tax rate, showing the estimated dollar amount of each of the underlying causes for the difference. If no individual reconciling item amounts to more than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying the income before tax by the applicable statutory Federal income tax rate, and the total difference to be reconciled is less than five percent of such computed amount, no reconciliation need be provided unless it would be significant in appraising the trend of earnings. Reconciling items that are individually less than five percent of the computed amount may be aggregated in the reconciliation. The reconciliation may be presented in percentages rather than in dollar amounts. Where the reporting person is a foreign entity, the income tax rate in that person's country of domicile should normally be used in making the above computation, but different rates should not be used for subsidiaries or other segments of a reporting entity. When the rate used by a reporting person is other than the United States Federal corporate income tax rate, the rate used and the basis for using such rate shall be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Paragraphs (h) (1) and (2) of this section shall be applied in the following manner to financial statements which reflect the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The disclosures required by paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section and by the parenthetical instruction at the end of paragraph (h)(1) of this section and by the introductory sentence of paragraph (h)(2) of this section shall not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The instructional note between paragraphs (h) (1) and (2) of this section
