Inquiries should be made by name, date and place of  birth, and other identifying information, to local courts and law  enforcement agencies for records of pending charges and convictions.  Local practice may require such inquiries to be made in person, rather  than by mail, and a copy of an authorization from the employee may be  required by certain law enforcement agencies.</p><p class="depth0">DEA inquiries. Inquiries supplying identifying information should  also be furnished to DEA Field Division Offices along with written  consent from the concerned individual for a check of DEA files for  records of convictions. The Regional check will result in a national  check being made by the Field Division Office.  [40 FR 17143, Apr. 17, 1975, as amended at 47 FR 41735, Sept. 22, 1982]</p>
