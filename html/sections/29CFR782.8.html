                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Interstate Commerce Commission consistently maintained that  transportation with a State of consumable goods (such as food, coal, and  ice) to railroad, docks, etc., for use of trains and steamships is not  such transportation as is subject to its jurisdiction. (New Pittsburgh  Coal Co. v. Hocking Valley Ry. Co., 24 I.C.C. 244; Corona Coal Co. v.  Secretary of War, 69 I.C.C. 389; Bunker Coal from Alabama to Gulf Ports,  227 I.C.C. 485.) The intrastate delivery of chandleries, including  cordage, canvas, repair parts, wire rope, etc., to ocean-going vessels  for use and consumption aboard such vessels which move in interstate or  foreign commerce falls within this category. Employees of carriers so  engaged are considered to be engaged in commerce, as that term is used  in the Fair Labor Standards Act. These employees may also be engaged in  the ``production of goods for commerce'' within the meaning of section  3(j) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. See cases cited in Sec. 782.7(c),  and see Mitchell v. Independent Ice Co., 294 F. 2d 186 (C.A. 5),  certiorari denied 368 U.S. 952, and part 776 of this chapter. Since the  Commission has disclaimed jurisdiction over this type of operation (see,  in this connection Sec. 782.7(b)), it is the Division's opinion that  drivers, driver's helpers, loaders, and mechanics employed by companies  engaged in such activities are covered by the wage and hours provisions  of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and are not within the exemption  contained in section 13(b)(1). (See Hansen v. Salinas Valley Ice Co.  (Cal. App.), 144 P. (2d) 896.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of the Fair Labor Standards  Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em>  of the Motor Carrier Act, as amended on May   16, 1942, includes employees employed by railroads, water carriers, and  freight forwarders, in transfer, collection, and delivery service in  terminal areas by motor vehicles within the Interstate Commerce  Commission's regulatory power under section 204 of the same act. See  Morris v. McComb, 332 U.S. 422 and Sec. 782.2(a). (Such employees of a  carrier subject to part I of the Interstate Commerce Act may come within  the exemption from the overtime requirements provided by section  13(b)(2). Cf. Cedarblade v. Parmelee Transp. Co. (C.A. 7), 166 F. (2d)  554, 14 Labor Cases, par. 64,340. Thus, only employees of a railroad,  water carrier, or freight forwarder outside of the scope of part I of  the Interstate Commerce Act and of the 13(b)(2) exemption are affected  by the above on and after the date of the amendment.) Both before and  after the amendments referred to, it has been the Division's position  that the 13(b)(1) exemption is applicable to drivers, drivers' helpers,  loaders, and mechanics employed in pickup and delivery service to line- haul motor carrier depots or under contract with forwarding companies,  since the Interstate Commerce Commission had determined that its  regulatory power under section 204 of the Motor Carrier Act extended to  such employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The determinations of the Interstate Commerce Commission  discussed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section have not been  amended or revoked by the Secretary of Transportation. These  determinations will continue to guide the Administrator of the Wage and  Hour Division in his enforcement of section 13(b)(1) of the Fair Labor  Standards Act.
