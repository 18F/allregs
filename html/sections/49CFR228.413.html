Appendix A to Part 228--Requirements of the Hours of Service Act:</p><p class="depth0">Statement of Agency Policy and Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">First enacted in 1907, the Hours of Service Act was substantially  revised in 1969 by Public Law 91-169. Further amendments were enacted as  part of the Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act of 1976, Public  Law 94-348 and by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988, Public Law  100-342. The purpose of the law is ``to promote the safety of employees  and travelers upon railroads by limiting the hours of service of  employees * * *.'' This appendix is designed to explain the effect of  the law in commonly-encountered situations.</p><p class="depth0">The Act governs the maximum work hours of employees engaged in one  or more of the basic categories of covered service treated below. If an  individual performs more than one kind of covered service during a tour  of duty, then the most restrictive of the applicable limitations  control.</p><p class="depth0">The act applies to any railroad, as that term is defined in 45  U.S.C. 431(e). It governs the carrier's operations over its own railroad  and all lines of road which it uses.</p><p class="depth0">train and engine service</p><p class="depth0">Covered Service. Train or engine service refers to the actual  assembling or operation of trains. Employees who perform this type of  service commonly include locomotive engineers, firemen, conductors,  trainmen, switchmen, switchtenders (unless their duties come under the  provisions of section 3) and hostlers. With the passage of the 1976  amendments, both inside and outside hostlers are considered to be  connected with the movement of trains. Previously, only outside hostlers  were covered. Any other employee who is actually engaged in or connected  with the movement of any train is also covered, regardless of his job  title.</p><p class="depth0">Limitations on Hours. The Act establishes two limitations on hours  of service. First, no employee engaged in train or engine service may be  required or permitted to work in excess of twelve consecutive hours.  After working a full twelve consecutive hours, an employee must be given  at least ten consecutive hours off duty before being permitted to return  to work.</p><p class="depth0">Second, no employee engaged in train or engine service may be  required or permitted to continue on duty or go on duty unless he has  had at least eight consecutive hours off duty within the preceding  twenty-four hours. This latter limitation, when read in conjunction with  the requirements with respect to computation of duty time (discussed  below) results in several conclusions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When an employee's work tour is broken or interrupted by a valid  period of interim release (4 hours or more at a designated terminal), he  may return to duty for the balance of the total 12-hour work tour during  a 24-hour period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After completing the 12 hours of broken duty, or at the end of  the 24-hour period, whichever occurs first, the employee may not be  required or permitted to continue on duty or to go on duty until he has  had at least 8 consecutive hours off duty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The 24-hour period referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above shall  begin upon the commencement of a work tour by the employee immediately  after his having received a statutory off-duty period of 8 or 10 hours  as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">Duty time and effective periods of release. On-duty time commences  when an employee reports at the time and place specified by the railroad  and terminates when the employee is finally released of all  responsibilities. (Time spent in deadhead transportation to a duty  assignment is also counted as time on duty. See discussion below.) Any  period available for rest that is of four or more hours and is at a  designated terminal is off-duty time. All other periods available for  rest must be counted as time on duty under the law, regardless of their  duration.</p><p class="depth0">The term ``designated terminal'' means a terminal (1) which is  designated in or under a collective bargaining agreement as the ``home''  or ``away-from-home'' terminal for a particular crew assignment and (2)  which has suitable facilities for food and lodging. Carrier and union  representatives may agree to establish additional designated terminals  having such facilities as points of effective release under the Act.  Agreements to designate additional terminals for purposes of release  under the Act should be reduced to writing and should make reference to  the particular assignments affected and to the Hours of Service Act. The  following are common situations illustrating the designated terminal  concept:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A freight or passenger road crew operates a train from home  terminal ``A'' to away-from-home terminal ``B'' (or the reverse).  Terminals ``A'' and ``B'' would normally be the designated terminals for  this specific crew assignment. However, carrier and employee  representatives may agree to designate additional terminals having  suitable facilities for food and lodging as appropriate points of  release under the Hours of Service Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A road crew operates a train in turn-around service from home  terminal ``A'' to turn-around point ``B'' and back to ``A''. Terminal  ``A'' is the only designated terminal for this specific crew assignment,  unless carrier and employee representatives have agreed to designate  additional terminals   having suitable facilities for food and lodging.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A crew is assigned to operate a maintenance-of-way work train  from home terminal ``A'', work on line of road and tie up for rest along  the line of road at point ``B''. Home terminal ``A'' and tie-up point  ``B'' both qualify as designated terminals for this specific work train  crew assignment. Of course, suitable facilities for food and lodging  must be available at tie-up point ``B''.</p><p class="depth0">Deadheading. Under the Act time spent in deadhead transportation  receives special treatment. Time spent in deadhead transportation to a  duty assignment by a train or engine service employee is considered on- duty time. Time spent in deadhead transportation from the final duty  assignment of the work tour to the point of final release is not  computed as either time on duty or time off duty. Thus, the period of  deadhead transportation to point of final release may not be included in  the required 8- or 10-hour off-duty period. Time spent in deadhead  transportation to a duty assignment is calculated from the time the  employee reports for deadhead until he reaches his duty assignment.</p><p class="depth0">All time spent awaiting the arrival of a deadhead vehicle for  transportation from the final duty assignment of the work tour to the  point of final release is considered limbo time, i.e., neither time on  duty nor time off duty, provided that the employee is given no specific  responsibilities to perform during this time. However, if an employee is  required to perform service of any kind during that period (e.g.,  protecting the train against vandalism, observing passing trains for any  defects or unsafe conditions, flagging, shutting down locomotives,  checking fluid levels, or communicating train consist information via  radio), he or she will be considered as on duty until all such service  is completed. Of course, where a railroad carrier's operating rules  clearly relieve the employee of all duties during the waiting period and  no duties are specifically assigned, the waiting time is not computed as  either time on duty or time off duty.</p><p class="depth0">Transit time from the employee's residence to his regular reporting  point is not considered deadhead time.</p><p class="depth0">If an employee utilizes personal automobile transportation to a  point of duty assignment other than the regular reporting point in lieu  of deadhead transportation provided by the carrier, such actual travel  time is considered as deadheading time. However, if the actual travel  time from his home to the point of duty assignment exceeds a reasonable  travel time from the regular reporting point to the point of duty  assignment, then only the latter period is counted. Of course, actual  travel time must be reasonable and must not include diversions for  personal reasons.</p><p class="depth0">Example: Employee A receives an assignment from an ``extra board''  located at his home terminal to protect a job one hour's drive from the  home terminal. In lieu of transporting the employee by carrier  conveyance, the railroad pays the employee a fixed amount to provide his  own transportation to and from the outlying point. The employee is  permitted to go directly from his home to the outlying point, a drive  which takes 40 minutes. The normal driving time between his regular  reporting point at his home terminal and the outlying point is 60  minutes. The actual driving time, 40 minutes is considered deadhead time  and is counted as time on duty under the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Employee A performs local switching service at the outlying point.  When the employee returns from the outlying point that evening, and  receives an ``arbitrary'' payment for his making the return trip by  private automobile, 40 minutes of his time in transportation home is  considered deadheading to point of final release and is not counted as  either time on duty or time off duty.</p><p class="depth0">Wreck and relief trains. Prior to the 1976 amendments, crews of  wreck and relief trains were exempted entirely from the limitations on  hours of service. Under present law that is no longer the case. The crew  of a wreck or relief train may be permitted to be on duty for not to  exceed 4 additional hours in any period of 24 consecutive hours whenever  an actual emergency exists and the work of the crew is related to that  emergency. Thus, a crew could work up to 16 hours, rather than 12. The  Act specifies that an emergency ceases to exist for purposes of this  provision when the track is cleared and the line is open for traffic. An  ``emergency'' for purposes of wreck or relief service may be a less  extraordinary or catastrophic event than an ``unavoidable accident or  Act of God'' under section 5(d) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Example: The crew of a wreck train is dispatched to clear the site  of a derailment which has just occurred on a main line. The wreck crew  re-rails or clears the last car and the maintenance of way department  releases the track to the operating department 14 hours and 30 minutes  into the duty tour. Since the line is not clear until the wreck train is  itself out of the way, the crew may operate the wreck train to its  terminal, provided this can be accomplished within the total of 16 hours  on duty.</p><p class="depth0">Emergencies. The Act contains no general exception using the term  ``emergency'' with respect to train or engine service or related work.  See ``casualties,'' etc., under ``General Provisions''.</p><p class="depth0">communication of train orders</p><p class="depth0">Covered Service. The handling of orders governing the movement of  trains is the second   type of covered service. This provision of the Act applies to any  operator, train dispatcher or other employee who by the use of the  telegraph, telephone, radio, or any other electical or mechanical device  dispatches, reports, transmits, receives, or delivers orders pertaining  to or affecting train movements.</p><p class="depth0">The approach of the law is functional. Thus, though a yardmaster  normally is not covered by this provision, a yardmaster or other  employee who performs any of the specified service during a duty tour is  subject to the limitations on service for that entire tour.</p><p class="depth0">Limitations on hours. No employee who performs covered service  involving communication of train orders may be required or permitted to  remain on duty for more than nine hours, whether consecutive or in the  aggregate, in any 24-hour period in any office, tower, station or place  where two or more shifts are employed. Where only one shift is employed,  the employee is restricted to 12 hours consecutively or in the aggregate  during any 24-hour period.</p><p class="depth0">The provision on emergencies, discussed below, may extend the  permissible hours of employees performing this type of service.</p><p class="depth0">Shifts. The term ``shift'' is not defined by the Act, but the  legislative history of the 1969 amendments indicates that it means a  tour of duty constituting a day's work for one or more employee  performing the same class of work at the same station who are scheduled  to begin and end work at the same time. The following are examples of  this principle:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Scheduled Hours                      Classification ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 7 a.m. to 3 p.m...........................  1 shift. 7 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. 1:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.     Do.</p><p class="depth0">(Schedule for one employee including one</p><p class="depth0">hour lunch period). 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. (Two       Do.</p><p class="depth0">employees scheduled). 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Two      2 shifts.</p><p class="depth0">employees scheduled). ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Duty time and effective periods of release. If, after reporting to  his place of duty, an employee is required to perform duties at other  places during this same tour of duty, the time spent traveling between  such places is considered as time on duty. Under the traditional  administrative interpretation of section 3, other periods of  transportation are viewed as personal commuting and, thus, off-duty  time.</p><p class="depth0">A release period is considered off-duty time if it provides a  meaningful period of relaxation and if the employee is free of all  responsibilities to the carrier. One hour is the minimum acceptable  release period for this type of covered service.</p><p class="depth0">Emergencies. The section of the Act dealing with dispatchers,  operators, and others who transmit or receive train orders contains its  own emergency provision. In case of emergency, an employee subject to  the 9 or 12-hour limitation is permitted to work an additional four  hours in any 24-hour period, but only for a maximum of three days in any  period of seven consecutive days. However, even in an emergency  situation the carrier must make reasonable efforts to relieve the  employee.</p><p class="depth0">General Provisions</p><p class="depth0">(applicable to all covered service)</p><p class="depth0">Commingled Service. All duty time for a railroad even though not  otherwise subject to the Act must be included when computing total on- duty time of an individual who performs one or more of the type of  service covered by the Act. This is known as the principle of  ``commingled service''.</p><p class="depth0">For example, if an employee performs duty for 8 hours as a trainman  and then is used as a trackman (not covered by the law) in the same 24- hour period, total on-duty time is determined by adding the duty time as  trackman to that as trainman. The law does not distinguish treatment of  situations in which non-covered service follows, rather than precedes,  covered service. The limitations on total hours apply on both cases. It  should be remembered that attendance at required rules classes is duty  time subject to the provisions on ``commingling''. Similarly, where a  carrier compels attendance at a disciplinary proceeding, time spent in  attendance is subject to the provisions on commingling.</p><p class="depth0">When an employee performs service covered by more than one  restrictive provision, the most restrictive provision determines the  total lawful on-duty time. Thus, when an employee performs duty in train  or engine service and also as an operator, the provisions of the law  applicable to operators apply to all on-duty and off-duty periods during  such aggregate time. However, an employee subject to the 12 hour  provision of section 2 of the law does not become subject to the 9 or  12-hour provisions of section 3 merely because he receives, transmits or  delivers orders pertaining to or affecting the movement of his train in  the course of his duties as a trainman.</p><p class="depth0">Casualties, Unavoidable Accidents, Acts of God. Section 5(d) of the  Act states the following: ``The provisions of this Act shall not apply  in any case of casualty or unavoidable accident or the Act of God; nor  where the delay was the result of a cause not known to the carrier or  its officer or agent in charge of the employee at the time said employee  left a terminal, and which could not have been foreseen.'' This passage  is commonly referred to as the ``emergency provision''. Judicial  construction of this sentence has limited the relief which it grants to  situations   which are truly unusual and exceptional. The courts have recognized that  delays and operational difficulties are common in the industry and must  be regarded as entirely foreseeable; otherwise, the Act will provide no  protection whatsoever. Common operational difficulties which do not  provide relief from the Act include, but are not limited to, broken draw  bars, locomotive malfunctions, equipment failures, brake system  failures, hot boxes, unexpected switching, doubling hills and meeting  trains. Nor does the need to clear a main line or cut a crossing justify  disregard of the limitations of the Act. Such contingencies must  normally be anticipated and met within the 12 hours. Even where an  extraordinary event or combination of events occurs which, by itself,  would be sufficient to permit excess service, the carrier must still  employ due diligence to avoid or limit such excess service. The burden  of proof rests with the carrier to establish that excess service could  not have been avoided.</p><p class="depth0">Sleeping Quarters. Under the 1976 amendments to the Act it is  unlawful for any common carrier to provide sleeping quarters for persons  covered by the Hours of Service Act which do not afford such persons an  opportunity for rest, free from interruptions caused by noise under the  control of the railroad, in clean, safe, and sanitary quarters. Such  sleeping quarters include crew quarters, camp or bunk cars, and  trailers.</p><p class="depth0">Sleeping quarters are not considered to be ``free from interruptions  caused by noise under the control of the railroad'' if noise levels  attributable to noise sources under the control of the railroad exceed  an Leq(8) value of 55dB(A).</p><p class="depth0">Collective Bargaining. The Hours of Service Act prescribes the  maximum permissible hours of service consistent with safety. However,  the Act does not prohibit collective bargaining for shorter hours of  service and time on duty.</p><p class="depth0">Penalty. As amended by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 and  the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act of 1992, the penalty  provisions of the law apply to any person (an entity of any type covered  under 1 U.S.C. 1, including but not limited to the following: a  railroad; a manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of  a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad  equipment, track, or facilities; any independent contractor providing  goods or services to a railroad; and any employee of such owner,  manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor), except that a  penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a willful  violation. See appendix A to 49 CFR part 209. For violations that  occurred on September 3, 1992, a person who violates the Act is liable  for a civil penalty, as the Secretary of Transportation deems  reasonable, in an amount not less than $500 nor more than $11,000,  except that where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated  violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury to persons,  or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $22,000 may be  assessed. The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990  as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 required  agencies to increase the maximum civil monetary penalty for inflation.  The amounts increased from $10,000 to $11,000 and from $20,000 to  $22,000 respectively. According to the same law, in 2004, the minimum  penalty of $500 was raised to $550, and the maximum penalty for a  grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations that has  caused an imminent hazard of death or injury to individuals or has  caused death or injury, was increased from $22,000 to $27,000. The  $11,000 maximum penalty was not adjusted. Effective October 9, 2007, the  ordinary maximum penalty of $11,000 was raised to $16,000 as required  under law. Effective March 2, 2009, the minimum penalty, ordinary  maximum penalty and aggravated maximum penalty were raised again. The  minimum penalty was increased from $550 to $650 pursuant to the law's  requirement. Meanwhile, the ordinary maximum penalty was increased from  $16,000 to $25,000 and the aggravated maximum was increased from $27,000  to $100,000 in accordance with the authority provided under the Rail  Safety Improvement Act of 2008. Meanwhile, the ordinary maximum penalty  was increased from $16,000 to $25,000 and the aggravated maximum was  increased from $27,000 to $100,000 in accordance with the authority  provided under the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. See sec. 302,  Div. A, Public Law 110-432, 122 Stat. 4848, 4878, Oct. 16, 2008; 49  U.S.C. 21301-21303. Effective June 25, 2012, the aggravated maximum  penalty was raised from $100,000 to $105,000 pursuant to the Federal  Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990. Public Law 101-410,  104 Stat. 890, 28 U.S.C. 2461, note, as amended by Sec. 31001(s)(1) of  the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Public Law 104-134, 110  Stat. 1321-373, Apr. 16, 1996.</p><p class="depth0">Each employee who is required or permitted to be on duty for a  longer period than prescribed by law or who does not receive a required  period of rest represents a separate and distinct violation and subjects  the railroad to a separate civil penalty. In the case of a violation of  section 2(a)(3) or (a)(4) of the Act, each day a facility is in  noncompliance constitutes a separate offense and subjects the railroad  to a separate civil penalty.</p><p class="depth0">In compromising a civil penalty assessed under the Act, FRA takes  into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the  violation committed, and, with respect to the person found to have  committed such   violation, the degree of culpability, any history of prior or subsequent  offenses, ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do business  and such other matters as justice may require.</p><p class="depth0">Statute of limitations. No suit may be brought after the expiration  of two years from the date of violation unless administrative  notification of the violation has been provided to the person to be  charged within that two year period. In no event may a suit be brought  after expiration of the period specified in 28 U.S.C. 2462.</p><p class="depth0">Exemptions. A railroad which employs not more than 15 persons  covered by the Hours of Service Act (including signalmen and hostlers)  may be exempted from the law's requirements by the FRA after hearing and  for good cause shown. The exemption must be supported by a finding that  it is in the public interest and will not adversely affect safety. The  exemption need not relate to all carrier employees. In no event may any  employee of an exempt railroad be required or permitted to work beyond  16 hours continuously or in the aggregate within any 24-hour period. Any  exemption is subject to review at least annually.

In  addition, the plan addresses each of the following items, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Employee education and training on the physiological and human  factors that affect fatigue, as well as strategies to reduce or mitigate  the effects of fatigue, based on the most current scientific and medical  research and literature;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Opportunities for identification, diagnosis, and treatment of  any medical condition that may affect alertness or fatigue, including  sleep disorders;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effects on employee fatigue of an employee's short-term or  sustained response to emergency situations, such as derailments and  natural disasters, or engagement in other intensive working conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Scheduling practices for employees, including innovative  scheduling practices, on-duty call practices, work and rest cycles,  increased consecutive days off for employees, changes in shift patterns,  appropriate scheduling practices for varying types of work, and other  aspects of employee scheduling that would reduce employee fatigue and  cumulative sleep loss;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Methods to minimize accidents and incidents that occur as a  result of working at times when scientific and medical research has  shown that increased fatigue disrupts employees' circadian rhythm;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Alertness strategies, such as policies on napping, to address  acute drowsiness and fatigue while an employee is on duty;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Opportunities to obtain restful sleep at lodging facilities,  including employee sleeping quarters provided by the railroad;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The increase of the number of consecutive hours of off-duty  rest, during which an employee receives no communication from the  employing railroad or its managers, supervisors, officers, or agents;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Avoidance of abrupt changes in rest cycles for employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Finally, if a railroad chooses to adopt a fatigue management  plan, FRA suggests that the railroad review the plan and update it  periodically as the railroad sees fit if changes are warranted.
