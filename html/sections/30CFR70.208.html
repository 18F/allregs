Sampling of each ODO type shall begin after fulfilling the sampling requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. When required to sample more than one ODO type, each ODO type must be sampled over separate time periods during the calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The quarterly periods are:January 1-March 31April 1-June 30July 1-September 30October 1-December 31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise directed by the District Manager, the approved sampling device shall be worn by the miner assigned to perform the duties of the DO or ODO specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this section or by the District Manager for each type of MMU.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conventional section using cutting machine.
