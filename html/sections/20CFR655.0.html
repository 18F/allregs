                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subparts A, B, and C--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Subparts A, B, and C of this  part set out the procedures adopted by the Secretary to secure  information sufficient to make factual determinations of: (i) Whether  U.S. workers are available to perform temporary employment in the United  States, for which an employer desires to employ nonimmigrant foreign  workers, and (ii) whether the employment of aliens for such temporary  work will adversely affect the wages or working conditions of similarly  employed U.S. workers. These factual determinations (or a determination  that there are not sufficient facts to make one or both of these  determinations) are required to carry out the policies of the  Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), that a nonimmigrant alien worker  not be admitted to fill a particular temporary job opportunity unless no  qualifed U.S. worker is available to fill the job opportunity, and  unless the employment of the foreign worker in the job opportunity will  not adversely affect the wages or working conditions of similarly  employed U.S. workers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary's determinations. Before any factual determination  can be made concerning the availability of U.S. workers to perform  particular job opportunities, two steps must be taken. First, the  minimum level of wages, terms, benefits, and conditions for the  particular job opportunities, below which similarly employed U.S.  workers would be adversely affected, must be established. (The  regulations in this part establish such minimum levels for wages, terms,  benefits, and conditions of employment.) Second, the wages, terms,  benefits, and conditions offered and afforded to the aliens must be  compared to the established minimum levels. If it is concluded that  adverse effect would result, the ultimate determination of availability  within the meaning of the INA cannot be made since U.S. workers cannot  be expected to accept employment under conditions below the established  minimum levels. Florida Sugar Cane League, Inc. v. Usery, 531 F. 2d 299  (5th Cir. 1976).  Once a determination of no adverse effect has been made, the  availability of U.S. workers can be tested only if U.S. workers are  actively recruited through the offer of wages, terms, benefits, and  conditions at least at the minimum level or the level offered to the  aliens, whichever is higher. The regulations in this part set forth  requirements for recruiting U.S. workers in accordance with this  principle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Construction. This part and its subparts shall be construed to  effectuate the purpose of the INA that U.S. workers rather than aliens  be employed wherever possible. Elton Orchards, Inc. v. Brennan, 508 F.  2d 493, 500 (1st Cir. 1974), Flecha v. Quiros, 567 F. 2d 1154 (1st Cir.  1977). Where temporary   alien workers are admitted, the terms and conditions of their employment  must not result in a lowering of the terms and conditions of domestic  workers similarly employed, Williams v. Usery, 531 F. 2d 305 (5th Cir.  1976); Florida Sugar Cane League, Inc. v. Usery, 531 F. 2d 299 (5th Cir.  1976), and the job benefits extended to any U.S. workers shall be at  least those extended to the alien workers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subparts D and E. Subparts D and E of this part set forth the  process by which health care facilities can file attestations with the  Department of Labor for the purpose of employing or otherwise using  nonimmigrant registered nurses under H-1A visas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subparts F and G. Subparts F and G of this part set forth the  process by which employers can file attestations with the Department of  Labor for the purpose of employing alien crewmembers in longshore work  under D-visas and enforcement provisions relating thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subparts H and I of this part. Subpart H of this part sets forth  the process by which employers can file labor condition applications  (LCAs) with, and the requirements for obtaining approval from, the  Department of Labor to temporarily employ the following three categories  of nonimmigrants in the United States: (1) H-1B visas for temporary  employment in specialty occupations or as fashion models of  distinguished merit and ability; (2) H-1B1 visas for temporary  employment in specialty occupations of nonimmigrant professionals from  countries with which the United States has entered into certain  agreements identified in section 214(g)(8)(A) of the INA; and (3) E-3  visas for nationals of the Commonwealth of Australia for temporary  employment in specialty occupations. Subpart I of this part establishes  the enforcement provisions that apply to the H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 visa  programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Subparts J and K of this part. Subparts J and K of this part set  forth the process by which employers can file attestations with the  Department of Labor for the purpose of employing nonimmigrant alien  students on F-visas in off-campus employment and enforcement provisions  relating thereto.
