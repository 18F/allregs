                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must declare in your application for certification your intent to use the provisions of this subpart for each family that will be certified using the ABT program. You must also declare the FELs you select for the family for each pollutant for which you are using the ABT program. Your FELs must comply with the specifications of subpart B of this part, including the FEL caps. FELs must be expressed to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Include the following in your application for certification:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement that, to the best of your belief, you will not have a negative balance of emission credits for any averaging set when all emission credits are calculated at the end of the year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Detailed calculations of projected emission credits (positive or negative) based on projected production volumes. We may require you to include similar calculations from your other engine families to demonstrate that you will be able to avoid a negative credit balance for the model year. If you project negative emission credits for a family, state the source of positive emission credits you expect to use to offset the negative emission credits.</p>
