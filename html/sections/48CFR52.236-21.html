                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 36.521, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Specifications and Drawings for Construction (FEB 1997)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Contractor shall keep on the work site a copy of the  drawings and specifications and shall at all times give the Contracting  Officer access thereto. Anything mentioned in the specifications and not  shown on the drawings, or shown on the drawings and not mentioned in the  specifications, shall be of like effect as if shown or mentioned in  both. In case of difference between drawings and specifications, the  specifications shall govern. In case of discrepancy in the figures, in  the drawings, or in the specifications, the matter shall be promptly  submitted to the Contracting Officer, who shall promptly make a  determination in writing. Any adjustment by the Contractor without such  a determination shall be at its own risk and expense. The Contracting  Officer shall furnish from time to time such detailed drawings and other  information as considered necessary, unless otherwise provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Wherever in the specifications or upon the drawings the words  directed, required, ordered, designated, prescribed, or words of like  import are used, it shall be understood that the direction, requirement,  order, designation, or prescription, of the Contracting Officer is  intended and similarly the words approved, acceptable, satisfactory, or  words of like import shall mean approved by, or acceptable to, or  satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, unless otherwise expressly  stated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where as shown, as indicated, as detailed, or words of similar  import are used, it shall be understood that the reference is made to  the drawings accompanying this contract unless stated otherwise. The  word provided as used herein shall be understood to mean provide  complete in place, that is furnished and installed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Shop drawings means drawings, submitted to the Government by the  Contractor, subcontractor, or any lower tier subcontractor pursuant to a  construction contract, showing in detail (1) the proposed fabrication  and assembly of structural elements and (2) the installation (i.e.,  form, fit, and attachment details) of materials or equipment. It  includes drawings, diagrams, layouts, schematics, descriptive  literature, illustrations, schedules, performance and test data, and  similar materials furnished by the contractor to explain in detail  specific portions of the work required by the contract. The Government  may duplicate, use, and disclose in any manner and for any purpose shop  drawings delivered under this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If this contract requires shop drawings, the Contractor shall  coordinate all such drawings, and review them for accuracy,  completeness, and compliance with contract requirements and shall  indicate its approval thereon as evidence of such coordination and  review. Shop drawings submitted to the Contracting Officer without  evidence of the Contractor's approval may be returned for resubmission.  The Contracting Officer will indicate an approval or disapproval of the  shop drawings and if not approved as submitted shall indicate the  Government's reasons therefor. Any work done before such approval shall  be at the Contractor's risk. Approval by the Contracting Officer shall  not relieve the Contractor from responsibility for any errors or  omissions in such drawings, nor from responsibility for complying with  the requirements of this contract, except with respect to variations  described and approved in accordance with (f) below.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If shop drawings show variations from the contract requirements,  the Contractor shall describe such variations in writing, separate from  the drawings, at the time of submission. If the Contracting Officer  approves any such variation, the Contracting Officer shall issue an  appropriate contract modification, except that, if the variation is  minor or does not involve a change in price or in time of performance, a  modification need not be issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer for  approval four copies (unless otherwise indicated) of all shop drawings  as called for under the various headings of these specifications. Three  sets (unless   otherwise indicated) of all shop drawings, will be retained by the  Contracting Officer and one set will be returned to the Contractor.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p><p class="depth2">Alterate I (APR 1984). When record shop drawings are required and  reproducible shop drawings are needed, add the following sentences to  paragraph (g) of the basic clause:  Upon completing the work under this contract, the Contractor shall  furnish a complete set of all shop drawings as finally approved. These  drawings shall show all changes and revisions made up to the time the  equipment is completed and accepted.</p><p class="depth2">Alternate II (APR 1984). When record shop drawings are required and  reproducible shop drawings are not needed, the following sentences shall  be added to paragraph (g) of the basic clause:  Upon completing the work under this contract, the Contractor shall  furnish ------ [Contracting Officer complete by inserting desired  amount] sets of prints of all shop drawings as finally approved. These  drawings shall show changes and revisions made up to the time the  equipment is completed and accepted.
