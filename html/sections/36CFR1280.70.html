                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The primary use of NARA property in the Washington, DC, area  (the National Archives Building and the National Archives at College  Park), including those areas open to the public, is the conduct of  official NARA business, including public programs and other activities  conducted in conjunction with government and non-government  organizations and the Foundation for the National Archives  (``Foundation''). In conducting official business, NARA and its partners  use all of the public areas of the Washington, DC, area facilities.  There are no public areas in the Washington National Records Center in  Suitland, MD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> NARA may permit, under the conditions described in this subpart,  the occasional use of certain public areas by other Federal agencies,  quasi-Federal agencies, and state, local, and tribal government  organizations for official activities. NARA also permits the occasional,  non-official use of its public areas by organizations when the activity  relates to or furthers NARA's archival, records, or other programs.</p>
