                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Confidential business information is  information which concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes,  operations, style of works, or apparatus, or to the production, sales,  shipments, purchases, transfers, identification of customers,  inventories, or amount or source of any income, profits, losses, or  expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other  organization, or other information of commercial value, the disclosure  of which is likely to have the effect of either impairing the  Commission's ability to obtain such information as is necessary to  perform its statutory functions, or causing substantial harm to the  competitive position of the person, firm, partnership, corporation, or  other organization from which the information was obtained, unless the  Commission is required by law to disclose such information. The term  ``confidential business information'' includes ``proprietary  information'' within the meaning of section 777(b) of the Tariff Act of  1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677f(b)). Nonnumerical characterizations of numerical  confidential business information (e.g., discussion of trends) will be  treated as confidential business information only at the request of the  submitter for good cause shown.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nondisclosable confidential business information is privileged  information, classified information, or specific information (e.g.,  trade secrets) of a type for which there is a clear and compelling need  to withhold from disclosure. Special rules for the handling of such  information are set out in Sec. 206.17 and Sec. 207.7 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure for submitting business information in confidence. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  A request for confidential treatment of business information shall be  addressed to the Secretary, United States International Trade  Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436, and shall indicate  clearly on the envelope that it is a request for confidential treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the absence of good cause shown, any request relating to  material to be submitted during the course of a hearing shall be  submitted at least three (3) working days prior to the commencement of  such hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> With each submission of, or offer to submit, business  information which a submitter desires to be treated as confidential  business information, under paragraph (a) of this section, the submitter  shall provide the following, which may be disclosed to the public:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A written description of the nature of the subject information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A justification for the request for its confidential treatment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A certification in writing under oath that substantially  identical information is not available to the public;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A copy of the document</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Clearly marked on its cover as to the pages on which  confidential information can be found;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> With information for which confidential treatment is requested  clearly identified by means of brackets; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> With information for which nondisclosable confidential treatment  is requested clearly identified by means of triple brackets (except when  submission of such document is withheld in accord with paragraph (b)(4)  of this section); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A nonconfidential copy of the documents as required by Sec.  201.8(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The submission of the documents itemized in paragraph (b)(3) of  this section will provide the basis for rulings on the confidentiality  of submissions, including rulings on the confidentiality of submissions  offered to the Commission which have not yet been placed under the  possession, control, or custody of the Commission. The submitter has the  option of providing the business information for which confidential  treatment is sought at the time the documents itemized in paragraph  (b)(3) of this section are provided or of withholding them until a  ruling on their confidentiality has been issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Identification of business information submitted in confidence.  Business information which a submitter desires to be treated as  confidential shall be clearly labeled ``confidential business  information'' when submitted, and shall be segregated from other  material being submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Approval or denial of requests for confidential treatment.  Approval or denial of requests shall be made only by the Secretary or  Acting Secretary. An approval or a denial of a request for confidential  treatment shall be in writing. A denial shall specify the reason  therefor, and shall advise the submitter of the right to appeal to the  Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Appeals from denial of confidential treatment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For good  cause shown, the Commission may grant an appeal from a denial by the  Secretary of a request for confidential treatment of a submission. Any  appeal filed shall be addressed to the Chairman, United States  International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436,  and shall clearly indicate that it is a confidential submission appeal.  An appeal may be made within twenty (20) days of a denial or whenever  the approval or denial has not been forthcoming within ten (10) days  (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays) of the  receipt of a confidential treatment request, unless an extension notice  in writing with the reasons therefor has been provided the person  requesting confidential treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An appeal will be decided within twenty (20) days of its receipt  (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays) unless an  extension notice in writing with the reasons therefor, has been provided  the person making the appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The justification submitted to the Commission in connection with  an appeal shall be limited to that presented to the Secretary with the  original or amended request. When the Secretary or Acting Secretary has  denied a request on the ground that the submitter failed to provide  adequate justification, any such additional justification shall be  submitted to the Secretary for consideration as part of an amended  request. For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the twenty  (20) day period for filing an appeal shall be tolled on the filing of an  amended request and a new twenty (20) day period shall begin once the  Secretary or Acting Secretary has denied the amended request, or the  approval or denial has not been forthcoming within ten (10) days of the  filing of the amended request. A denial of a request by the Secretary on  the ground of inadequate justification shall not obligate a requester to  furnish additional justification and shall not preclude a requester from  filing an appeal with the Commission based on the justification earlier  submitted to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Appeals from approval of confidential treatment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For good  cause shown, the Commission may grant an appeal from an approval by the  Secretary of a request for confidential treatment of a submission. Any  appeal filed shall be addressed to the Chairman, United   States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC  20436, shall show that a copy thereof has been served upon the  submitter, and shall clearly indicate that it is a confidential  submission appeal. An appeal may be made within twenty (20) days of the  approval by the Secretary of a request for confidential treatment or  whenever the approval or denial has not been forthcoming within ten (10)  days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays) of the  receipt of a confidential treatment request, unless an extension notice  in writing with the reasons therefor has been provided the person  requesting confidential treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An appeal will be decided within twenty (20) days of its receipt  (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays) unless an  extension notice, in writing with the reasons therefor, has been  provided the person making the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Granting confidential status to business information. Any  business information submitted in confidence and determined to be  entitled to confidential treatment shall be maintained in confidence by  the Commission and not disclosed except as required by law. In the event  that any business information submitted to the Commission is not  entitled to confidential treatment, the submitter will be permitted to  withdraw the tender within five days of its denial of confidential  treatment unless it is the subject of a request under the Freedom of  Information Act or of judicial discovery proceedings. After such five  day period, the business information deemed not entitled to confidential  treatment, and not withdrawn, will be treated as public information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Scope of provisions. The provisions of Sec. Sec. 201.6(b) and  201.6 (d) through (g) shall not apply to adjudicative investigations  under subchapter C, part 210, of the Commission's rules of practice and  procedure.
