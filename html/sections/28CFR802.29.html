Revealing disclosure accountings can compromise legitimate law enforcement activities and CSOSA/PSA responsibilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> From subsection (c)(4) because exemption from provisions of subsection (d) will make notification of formal disputes inapplicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> From subsection (d), (e)(4)(G) through (e)(4)(I), (f) and (g) because exemption from this subsection is essential to protect internal processes by which CSOSA/PSA personnel are able to formulate decisions and policies with regard to defendants/offenders, to prevent disclosure of information to defendants/offenders that would jeopardize legitimate correctional interests of rehabilitation, and to permit receipt of relevant information from other federal agencies, state and local law enforcement agencies, and federal and state probation and judicial offices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> From subsection (e)(1) because primary collection of information directly from defendants/offenders about criminal history or criminal records is highly impractical and inappropriate.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> It is not possible in all instances to determine relevancy or necessity of specific information in the early stages of a criminal or other investigation.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Relevancy and necessity are questions of judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected ultimately may be deemed unnecessary. It is only after the information is assessed that its relevancy and necessity in a specific investigative activity can be established.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of evidence or information during an investigation, information could be obtained, the nature of which would leave in doubt its relevancy and necessity. Such information, however, could be relevant to another investigation or to an investigative activity under the jurisdiction of another agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> From subsection (e)(2) because the nature of criminal and other investigative activities is such that vital information about an individual can only be obtained from other persons who are familiar with such individual and his/her activities. In such investigations it is not feasible to rely upon information furnished by the individual concerning his/her own activities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> From subsection (e)(3) because disclosure would provide the subject with substantial information which could impede or compromise the investigation. The individual could seriously interfere with investigative activities and could take appropriate steps to evade the investigation or flee a specific area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> From subsection (e)(8) because the notice requirements of this provision could seriously interfere with a law enforcement activity by alerting the subject of a criminal or other investigation of existing investigative interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Those sections would otherwise require CSOSA to notify an individual

of investigatory materials contained in a record pertaining to him/her, permit access to such record, permit requests for its correction (section 552a(d), (e)(4)(G), and (H)); make available to him/her any required accounting of disclosures made of the record (section 552a(c)(3)), publish the sources of records in the system (section 552a(4)(I)); and screen records to insure that there is maintained only such information about an individual as is relevant to accomplish a required purpose of the Agency (section 552(e)(1)). In addition, screening for relevancy to Agency purposes, a correction or attempted correction of such materials could require excessive amounts of time and effort on the part of all concerned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p>
