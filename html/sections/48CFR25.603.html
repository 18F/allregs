The head of the contracting activity may  determine that a particular construction material is not mined,  produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and  reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality.  The determinations of nonavailability of the articles listed at  25.104(a) and the procedures at 25.103(b)(1) also apply if any of those  articles are acquired as construction materials.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unreasonable cost. The contracting officer concludes that the  cost of domestic construction material is unreasonable in accordance  with 25.605.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Inconsistent with public interest. The head of the agency may  determine that application of the restrictions of section 1605 of the  Recovery Act to a particular manufactured construction material, or the  restrictions of the Buy American statute to a particular unmanufactured  construction material would be inconsistent with the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition, the head of the agency may determine that  application of the Buy American statute to a particular unmanufactured  construction material would be impracticable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determinations. When a determination is made, for any of the  reasons stated in this section, that certain foreign construction  materials may be used--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contracting officer shall list the excepted materials in the  contract; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For determinations with regard to the inapplicability of section  1605 of the Recovery Act, unless the construction material has already  been determined to be domestically nonavailable (see list at 25.104),  the head of the agency shall provide a notice to the Federal Register  within three business days after the determination is made, with a copy  to the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy and to the Recovery  Accountability and Transparency Board. The notice shall include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The title ``Buy American Exception under the American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act of 2009'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The dollar value and brief description of the project; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A detailed justification as to why the restriction is being  waived.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acquisitions under trade agreements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For construction  contracts with an estimated acquisition value of $7,864,000 or more,  also see subpart 25.4. Offers proposing the use of construction material  from a designated country shall receive equal consideration with offers  proposing the use of domestic construction material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of applying section 1605 of the Recovery Act to  evaluation of manufactured construction material, designated countries  do not include the Caribbean Basin Countries.
