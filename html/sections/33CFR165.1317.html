                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice of enforcement or suspension of enforcement. The large passenger vessel security and safety zone established by this section will be enforced only

upon notice by the Captain of the Port Puget Sound.

Such means of notification may also include but are not limited to, Broadcast Notice to Mariners or Local Notice to Mariners.

Persons authorized in paragraph (l) to enforce this section are designated as the Official Patrol.</p><p class="depth2">Public vessel means vessels owned, chartered, or operated by the United States, or by a State or political subdivision thereof.</p><p class="depth2">Washington Law Enforcement Officer means any General Authority Washington Peace Officer, Limited Authority Washington Peace Officer, or Specially Commissioned Washington Peace Officer as defined in Revised Code of Washington section 10.93.020.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Security and safety zone. There is established a large passenger vessel security and safety zone extending for a 500-yard radius around all large passenger vessels located in the navigable waters of the United States in Puget Sound, WA, east of 12330 West Longitude. [Datum: NAD 1983].</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Compliance. The large passenger vessel security and safety zone established by this section remains in effect around large passenger vessels at all times, whether the large passenger vessel is underway, anchored, or moored. Upon notice of enforcement by the Captain of the Port Puget Sound, the Coast Guard will enforce the large passenger vessel security and safety zone in accordance with rules set out in this section. Upon notice of suspension of enforcement by the Captain of the Port Puget Sound, all persons and vessels are authorized to enter, transit, and exit the large passenger vessel security and safety zone, consistent with the Navigation Rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Navigation Rules shall apply at all times within a large passenger vessel security and safety zone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When within a large passenger vessel security and safety zone all vessels must operate at the minimum speed necessary to maintain a safe course and must proceed as directed by the on-scene official patrol or large passenger vessel master. No vessel or person is allowed within 100 yards of a large passenger vessel that is underway or at anchor, unless authorized by the on-scene official patrol or large passenger vessel master. No vessel or person is allowed within 25 yards of a large passenger vessel that is moored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> To request authorization to operate within 100 yards of a large passenger vessel that is underway or at anchor, contact the on-scene official patrol or large passenger vessel master on VHF-FM channel 16 or 13.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> When conditions permit, the on-scene official patrol or large passenger vessel master should:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Permit vessels constrained by their navigational draft or restricted in their ability to maneuver to pass within 100 yards of a large passenger vessel in order to ensure a safe passage in accordance with the Navigation Rules; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permit vessels that must transit via a navigable channel or waterway to pass within 100 yards of an anchored large passenger vessel or within 25 yards of a moored large passenger vessel with minimal delay consistent with security.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When a large passenger vessel approaches within 100 yards of any vessel that is moored or anchored, the stationary vessel must stay moored or anchored while it remains within the large passenger vessel's security and safety zone unless it is either ordered by, or given permission by the Captain of the Port Puget Sound, his designated representative or the on-scene official patrol to do otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Exemption.
