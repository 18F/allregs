                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For entitlement to pension or dependency and indemnity compensation,  income will be counted for the calendar year in which it is received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Installments. Income will be determined by the total amount  received or anticipated during the calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deferred determinations. Where there is doubt as to the amount  of the anticipated income, pension or dependency and indemnity  compensation will be allowed at the lowest appropriate rate or will be  withheld, as may be in order, until the end of the calendar year when  the total income received during the year may be determined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Proportionate income limitations; excess income. A proportionate  income limitation will be established under the conditions set forth in  paragraph (d) of this section except where application of a  proportionate income limitation would result in payment of a lower rate  than would be payable on the basis of income for the full calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proportionate income limitations; computation. Income  limitations will be computed proportionately for the purpose of  determining initial entitlement, or for resuming payments on an award  which was discontinued for a reason other than excess income or a   change in marital or dependency status. A proportionate income  limitation will be established for the period from the date of  entitlement to the end of that calendar year. The total amount of income  received by the claimant during that period will govern the payment of  benefits. Income received prior to the date of entitlement will be  disregarded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Proportionate income limitations; spouse. In determining whether  proportionate computation is applicable to a claim under Pub. L. 86-211  (73 Stat. 432), the total income for the calendar year of entitlement of  both veteran and that of the spouse available for use of the veteran  will be considered. If a proportionate income limitation is then  applicable, it will be applied to both the veteran's and the spouse's  income. The spouse's income will not be included, however, where his or  her total income for the calendar year does not exceed $1,200.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Rate changes. In years after that for which entitlement to  pension or dependency and indemnity compensation has been established or  reestablished as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, total income  for the calendar year will govern the payment of benefits. Where there  is a change in the conditions of entitlement because of a change in  marital or dependency status, entitlement for each period will be  determined separately. For the period when the claimant was married or  had a dependent, the rate payable will be determined under the annual  income limitation or increment applicable to a claimant who is married  or has a dependent. For the period when the claimant was unmarried or  without a dependent, the rate payable will be determined under the  annual income limitation or increment applicable to a claimant who is  not married or has no dependent. Since these determinations will be  based on total income for the calendar year, it is not material whether  such income was received before or after the change of status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(2)</em>; 1503(b))  [28 FR 30, Jan. 1, 1963, as amended at 29 FR 2944, Mar. 4, 1964; 37 FR  6677, Apr. 1, 1972; 40 FR 16066, Apr. 9, 1975]</p>
