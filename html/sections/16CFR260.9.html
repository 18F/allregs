                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is deceptive to misrepresent, directly or by implication,  that a product, package, or service is free of, or does not contain or  use, a substance. Such claims should be clearly and prominently  qualified to the extent necessary to avoid deception.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A truthful claim that a product, package, or service is free of,  or does not contain or use, a substance may nevertheless be deceptive  if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The product, package, or service contains or uses substances  that pose the same or similar environmental risks as the substance that  is not present; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The substance has not been associated with the product category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Depending on the context, a free-of or does-not-contain claim is  appropriate even for a product, package, or service that contains or  uses a trace amount of a substance if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The level of the specified substance is no more than that which  would be found as an acknowledged trace contaminant or background level  \47\; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\47\ ``Trace contaminant'' and ``background level'' are imprecise  terms, although allowable manufacturing ``trace contaminants'' may be  defined according to the product area concerned. What constitutes a  trace amount or background level depends on the substance at issue, and  requires a case-by-case analysis. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The substance's presence does not cause material harm that  consumers typically associate with that substance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The substance has not been added intentionally to the product.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1: A package of t-shirts is labeled ``Shirts made with a  chlorine-free bleaching process.'' The shirts, however, are bleached  with a process that releases a reduced, but still significant, amount of  the same harmful byproducts associated with chlorine bleaching. The  claim overstates the product's benefits because reasonable consumers  likely would interpret it to mean that the product's manufacture does  not cause any of the environmental risks posed by chlorine bleaching. A  substantiated claim, however, that the shirts were ``bleached with a  process that releases 50% less of the harmful byproducts associated with  chlorine bleaching'' would not be deceptive.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2: A manufacturer advertises its insulation as  ``formaldehyde free.'' Although the manufacturer does not use  formaldehyde as a binding agent to produce the insulation, tests show  that the insulation still emits trace amounts of formaldehyde. The  seller has substantiation that formaldehyde is present in trace amounts  in virtually all indoor and (to a lesser extent) outdoor environments  and that its insulation emits less formaldehyde than is typically  present in outdoor environments. Further, the seller has substantiation  that the trace amounts of formaldehyde emitted by the insulation do not  cause material harm that consumers typically associate with  formaldehyde. In this context, the trace levels of formaldehyde  emissions likely are inconsequential to consumers. Therefore, the  seller's free-of claim would not be deceptive.</p>
