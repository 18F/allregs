offender. If in an earlier decision the Commission has given an offender a presumptive release date or a date for a 15-year reconsideration hearing, then the result of the tie vote is no change in the presumptive date or the date of the 15-year reconsideration hearing. If an offender is facing possible parole rescission or revocation, the result of the tie vote is the offender's retention of the parole effective date or the offender's return to supervision. Exception: If there is a tie vote in making one of the findings required by Sec.  2.53 in a mandatory parole determination, the result of the tie vote is that the prisoner must be granted mandatory parole.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission may re-vote on a case disposition to resolve a tie vote or other impasse in satisfying a voting requirement of these rules.
