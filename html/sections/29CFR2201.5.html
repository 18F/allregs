All requests for information must be made in writing and must be mailed or delivered to the FOIA Disclosure Officer at the address in Sec. 2201.3(d). The words ``Freedom of Information Act Request'' must be printed on the face of the request's envelope or covering as well as the request itself. Requests for information must describe the particular record requested to the fullest extent possible and specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the response. The Commission shall accommodate requesters as to form or format if the record is readily reproducible in the requested form or format. When requesters do not specify the preferred form or format of the response, the Commission shall respond in the form or format in which the record is most accessible to the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Date of receipt. A request that complies with paragraph (a) of this section is deemed received on the actual date it is received by the Commission. A request that does not comply with paragraph (a) of this section is deemed received when it is actually received by the FOIA Disclosure Officer. For requests that are expected to result in fees exceeding $250, the request shall not be deemed to have been received until the requester is advised of the anticipated costs and the Commission has

received full payment or satisfactory assurance of full payment as provided under Sec. 2201.7(f).</p>
