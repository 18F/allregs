The amount normally payable on property damaged beyond economical repair shall not exceed its depreciated value. If the cost of repairs is less than the depreciated value it shall be considered economically repairable and the costs of repairs shall be the amount payable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Depreciation in value of an item shall be determined by considering the type of article involved, its replacement cost, condition when lost or damaged beyond economical repair, and the time elapsed between the date of acquisition and the date of accrual of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, settlements of claims under the MPCE Act are final and conclusive.
