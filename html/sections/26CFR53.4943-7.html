                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rules--(1) Readjustments. Except to the extent provided  in paragraph (b) of this section, if a private foundation, its  disqualified persons, or both together have holdings in a corporation to  which section 4943(c) (4) or (5) applies, stock of a corporation  received by the foundation, its disqualified persons, or both together  in a readjustment (as defined in paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section) in  exchange for such holdings to which section 4943 (c) (4) or (5) applies  shall be treated, for purposes of section 4943 (c) (4) or (5), as the  stock surrendered in the exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No exchange necessary. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall  apply to all readjustments even if no exchange occurs. For purposes of  this section, all stock held (directly or indirectly) before a  readjustment in any corporation involved in the readjustment shall be  treated as stock surrendered in the readjustment and all stock held  (directly or indirectly) after the readjustment in   any corporation involved in the readjustment shall be treated as stock  received in the readjustment in exchange for the stock

exchange  described in paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the greatest  percentage of voting stock in any business enterprise owned (directly or  indirectly) by the private foundation prior to such exchange by reason  of its ownership of the stock surrendered by it in the exchange, then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That portion of the stock received by the private foundation in  the

If the  percentage of value of all outstanding shares of all classes of stock in  a business enterprise owned (directly or indirectly) by a private  foundation by reason of its ownership of stock received in an exhange  described in paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the greatest  percentage of such value in any business enterprise owned (directly or  indirectly) by the private foundation prior to such exchange by reason  of its ownership of the stock surrendered by it in the exchange, then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That portion of the stock received by the private foundation

voting stock and value. (i) If,  as the result of an exchange described in paragraph (a) of this section,  a private foundation has excesses determined under both paragraphs  (b)(1)(i) and (b)(2)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That portion of the stock received by the private foundation in  the exchange that represents the larger excess is to be treated as an  increase in the holdings of the private foundation in accordance with  Sec. 53.4943-6(d), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Only the remaining portion of the stock received by the private  foundation in the exchange is to be treated as the stock surrendered by  the private foundation in the exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That portion of the stock received by the disqualified persons  in the exchange that represents the larger excess is to be treated as an  increase in the holdings of the disqualified persons in accordance with  Sec. 53.4943-6(d), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Only the remaining portion of the stock received by disqualified  persons in the exchange is to be treated as the stock surrendered by  disqualified persons in the exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exception for prohibited transactions. If a readjustment  includes a prohibited transaction, as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of  this section, then this paragraph shall be applied substituting, for  purposes of paragraph (b)(1) and (b)(2), the lowest percentage of voting  power or value owned prior to the exchange in any business enterprise  involved in the readjustment to which the exchange relates for the  greatest percentage of voting power or value in any business enterprise  owned by reason of ownership of the stock surrendered in the exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Voting and value levels. After an exchange described in  paragraph (a) of this section, the private foundation voting and value  levels, and the substituted combined voting and value levels (as defined  in Sec. 53.4943-4(d)(2)) shall be the lesser of each respective level  immediately prior to the exchange with respect to the stock surrendered  in the exchange and each such respective level determined immediately  after the exchange by taking into account only the stock received in the  exchange that is treated under this paragraph as the stock surrendered  in the exchange. If the stock of more than one corporation is  surrendered in exchange for stock of one corporation, the highest of  each voting or value level determined immediately prior to the exchange  with respect to the stock of the corporations surrendered in the  exchange shall be treated as such level immediately prior to the  exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Determination of phases--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Stock received in an  exchange described in paragraph (a) of this section that is treated as  stock surrendered in the exchange under this paragraph shall be treated  as subject to the same first, second, and third phases that were  applicable to the stock surrendered for it. For purposes of determining  the applicable phases, stock received in an exchange shall be treated as  received in exchange for particular holdings of stock surrendered based  on the terms of the exchange. Where only a portion of the stock received  is treated as the stock surrendered, such portion of the stock received  shall be treated as exchanged for particular holdings of stock  surrendered in the same proportions as the total stock received was  exchanged for particular holdings of stock surrendered. For example, if  20 shares of X stock owned by a private foundation, subject to a first  phase beginning on January 1, 1978 and ending on December 31, 1987, are  exchanged for 20 shares of Y stock, and 40 shares of X stock owned by  the private foundation, subject to a first phase beginning on June 1,  1980 and ending on May 31, 1990, are exchanged for 40 shares of Y stock,  then \1/3\ of the Y stock received by the private foundation is treated  as received in exchanged for X stock having the January 1, 1978-December  31, 1987 first phase and \2/3\ of the Y stock received by the private  foundation is treated as received in exchange for the X stock having the  June 1, 1980-May 31, 1990 first phase. If only 30 shares of the Y stock  received by the private foundation are treated as the   stock surrendered, then \1/3\ (10 Y shares) will be subject to the  January 1, 1978-December 31, 1987 first phase and \2/3\ (20 Y shares)  will be subject to the June 1, 1980-May 31, 1990 first phase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transitional rule. In any case in which holdings subject to  section 4943(c)(4) or 4943(c)(5) have been consolidated prior to May 22,  1984, then the longest first phase applicable to any of the holdings  surrendered in the consolidation shall be applied to the holdings  received by the foundation in the consolidation that are treated as the  holdings surrendered in the consolidation. For purposes of this clause,  a consolidation is any readjustment that results in a reduction in the  number of entities in which the foundation has direct holdings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Plan to dispose of excess business holdings. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding  Sec. 53.4943-4(d)(i)(4)(D) (relating to restrictions on increases in  levels) and paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if a readjustment  occurs under an approved plan to dispose of stock to which section  4943(c) (4) or (5) applies, in order to meet the requirements of section  4943(c)(4) (i.e., to meet the reduced limits that will be applicable  after the first phase holding period described in Sec. 53.4943-4(c)) or  to meet the requirements of section 4943(c)(2), all of the stock  received in the readjustment shall be treated as held by disqualified  persons through the end of the longest first phase holding period  applicable to stock surrendered in the readjustment. The foundation and  substituted combined voting and value levels shall not be increased on  account of the readjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this paragraph, a plan is an approved plan only  if it is approved by the Commissioner and may be subject to such  conditions as the Commissioner determines. A plan must be approved prior  to any exchange or distribution pursuant to the plan except for a  showing of good cause such as a business emergency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Readjustments. For purposes of this section,  the term ``readjustment'' includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A merger or consolidation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A recapitalization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An acquisition of stock or assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A transfer of assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A change in identity, form, or place of organization, however  effected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A redemption;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A distribution of assets or of stock, including a distribution  to which section 301, 302, 331, or 355 applies or a distribution of  stock of the distributing corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prohibited transaction. A prohibited transaction is any  transaction involving a private foundation that has holdings in a  business enterprise which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Acquires stock (or similar interest in the case of an  unincorporated entity) or assets of a business enterprise or redeems its  own stock (or similar interest in the case of an unincorporated entity)  using cash or other property transferred to the acquiring business  enterprise (e.g., as a contribution to capital) by the private  foundation, its disqualified persons, or both;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Acquires stock (or similar interest in the case of an  unincorporated entity) or assets of a business enterprise or redeems its  own stock (or similar interest in the case of an unincorporated entity)  using the proceeds of a loan made to, or guaranteed by, the private  foundation, its disqualified persons, or both;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Acquires 40 percent or more of the voting stock (or similar  interest in the case of an unincorporated entity), 40 percent or more of  the value of all outstanding shares of all classes of stock (or similar  interest in the case of an unincorporated entity), or 40 percent or more  of the assets of a business enterprise if the acquiring business  enterprise's net assets used in its trade or business prior to such  acquisition are insubstantial when compared to the net assets acquired  or when compared to the net assets of the business enterprise, the stock  (or similar interest in the case of an unincorporated entity) of which  was acquired. For this purpose, an insubstantial ratio means a ratio  that is 15% or less; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Is used as a device to acquire or expand excess business  holdings. The determination of whether a business enterprise is used as  a device to acquire or expand excess business holdings shall be  determined based on all the   facts and circumstances. A business enterprise shall be presumed to have  been used as a device to acquire or expand excess business holdings if  it acquires 40 percent or more of the voting stock (or similar interest  in the case of an unincorporated entity), 40 percent or more of the  value of all outstanding shares of all classes of stock (or similar  interest in the case of an unincorporated entity), or 40 percent or more  of the assets of a business enterprise if the consideration for the  acquisition consists primarily of nonvoting stock (or similar interest  in the case of an unincorporated entity) of the acquiring business  enterprise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Corporation involved in a readjustment. A corporation shall be  treated as involved in a readjustment if, as part of the readjustment,  any stock of the corporation is issued or redeemed, or any stock or  assets of the corporation are distributed, exchanged, purchased, sold,  acquired, or otherwise transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Application to unincorporated business enterprise. The rules of  this section shall apply equally to partnerships and other  unincorporated business enterprises, applying the rules and  substitutions provided in Sec. 53.4943-3(c)(2), (3), and (4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section and Sec. 53.4943-6(d)  are illustrated by the following examples, which assume no prohibited  transactions are involved unless otherwise stated:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> F, a private foundation, has owned 80% of the one  outstanding class of stock of X corporation since 1965. The X is subject  to section 4943(c)(4) with a first phase ending on May 25, 1984. On  January 1, 1982, X merges with Y corporation to form Z corporation. X,  Y, and Z are active business corporations. F owns no Y stock. No  disqualified person with respect to F owns any stock in Y.Y, or Z. After  the merger, F owns 25% of the one outstanding class of Z stock. Third  parties do not control Z so that the 35% permitted holdings rule under  section 4943(c)(2) is inapplicable</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> F's percentage of voting power and value in Z after the merger  (25%) are less than F's percentages of voting power and value in X  before the merger (80%). Therefore, under paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, all of F's holdings in Z are treated as the X stock  surrendered. Therefore, the Z stock is treated as subject to section  4943(c)(4) with a first phase ending on May 25, 1984. Under downward  ratchet of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the foundation voting and  value levels and the substituted combined voting and value levels are  reduced to 25%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> F, a private foundation, owns 100% of the one  outstanding class of stock in X corporation and 30% of the one  outstanding class of stock in Y corporation. F has held this stock  continuously since 1960, and no disqualified person has even owned any  stock in X or Y. Under section 4943(c)(4), F's holdings in X are treated  as held by disqualified persons through the end of the first phase on  May 25, 1989, and F's holdings in Y are permitted holdings during the  second phase, which began on May 25, 1989, and F's holdings in Y are  permitted holdings during the second phase, which began on May 26, 1979.  On January 1, 1985, X and Y consolidate, forming a new corporation Z. In  the consolidation, F acquires 50% of the one class of outstanding stock  of Z, 40% in exchange for F's 100% interest in X and 10% in exchange for  F's 30% interest in Y. Unrelated parties hold the remaining 50% of Z.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> F's percentage of voting power and value in Z after the merger  (50%) are less than F's percentages of voting power and value in X  before the merger (100%). Thus, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section,  the 50% interest in Z held by F is treated as the stock surrendered in  the exchange for purposes of section 4943(c)(4). Under paragraph (b)(6)  of this section, the 10% interest in Z received for the Y stock is  subject to the same second phase period as the surrendered Y stock. The  40% interest first phase period as the surrendered X stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> F, a private foundation, owns 50% of the one class of  outstanding stock in X corporation which F has held continuously since  1935. No disqualified person with respect to F owns any stock in X.  Neither F nor any disqualified person with respect to F owns any stock  in Y corporation. On July 1, 1982, X and Y enter into an agreement to  consolidate their businesses in a reorganization to which section  368(a)(1)(A) will apply. As a result of the contemplated consolidation,  F will own 60% of the voting stock in Z, the resulting corporation. In  addition, parties unrelated to F will own the remaining 40% of the Z  voting stock and 100% of a new issue of nonvoting preferred stock in Z.  Assume for purposes of this example, that the 60% of the voting stock to  be held by F in Z will represent 50% of the fair market value of the  outstanding Z stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that  portion of the Z stock held by F which represents a percentage of voting  power equivalent to that held by F in X immediately prior to the  consolidation (i.e., 50%) will be treated as the X stock held by F on  May 26, 1969, for purposes of section 4943(c)(4). Therefore, 50% of the  Y stock will   be treated as subject to a second phase ending on May 25, 1994. The  remaining portion of the Z voting stock held by F (10%) is subject to  the provisions of Sec. 53.4943-6(d)(1). F will have five years from the  date of the merger in which to dispose of 10% of the Z stock without  incurring the tax on excess business holdings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> F, a private foundation, owns 80% of the one class of  outstanding stock in X corporation, an active business corporation. F  has held this stock continuously since 1960 and no disqualified person  with respect to F owns any stock in X. X has two operating divisions,  one which manufacturers shoes and the other which manufactures  refrigerators. On January 1, 1978, in a section 351(a) exchange, X  transferred all of the assets of its shoe manufacturing division to Y, a  corporation which X has formed for this purpose, and receives 100% of  the stock of Y so that Y is a wholly-owned subsidiary of X. X then  transfers all of the Y stock to F in exchange for all of F's holdings of  X stock in a distribution to which section 355 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 80% of the Y stock is  treated as the X stock surrendered in the exchange for purposes of  section 4943(c)(4). The 80% is treated under Sec. 53.4943-4(c) as held  by disqualified persons through May 25, 1984, which constitutes the 15- year first phase holding period applicable to the 80% holding in X. The  80% of the Y stock must be reduced to the permitted holdings allowed  during the second and third phase as provided by section 4943(c)(4)(D)  in the same manner as F's holdings of X stock would have had to have  been reduced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under Sec. 53.4943-6(d)(1), the remaining 20% of Y stock is  treated as held by a disqualified person for five years from the date of  the exchange. F will have five years from the date of the exchange in  which to dispose of 20% of the Y stock without incurring the tax on  excess business holdings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X corporation, an active business corporation, has  outstanding 1,000 shares of one class of stock, of which 600 shares have  been held by F1, a private foundation; 100 shares have been held by F2,  another private foundation; and 100 shares have been held by D, a  disqualified person with respect to both F1 and F2. Unrelated parties  hold the remaining 200 shares. F1 and F2 are disqualified persons with  respect to each other under section 4946(a)(1)(H). Thus, F1 holds 60% of  the X stock (600/1000); F2 and D each hold 10% (100/1000); and the  foundation group (F1, F2 and D) holds 80% of X (800/1000). The holdings  of F1 and F2 were acquired on January 1, 1980 pursuant to a pre-1969  will and are subject to section 4943(c)(5). There have been no changes  in holdings since January 1, 1980.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On January 1, 1985, pursuant to a plan to dispose of excess  business holdings approved by the Commissioner under paragraph (c) of  this section, X redeems for cash the 600 shares held by F1. After the  redemption, D and F2 each hold 25% of X (100/400). F1 no longer holds  any X stocks. The foundation group's holdings (F1, F2 and D) have  decreased from 80% to 50% while holdings of unrelated parties have  increased from 20% to 50%. At the same time F2's and D's holdings each  have increased from 10% to 25%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Notwithstanding the increase in F2's and D's holdings, under  paragraph (c) of this section, all of the X stock held by F2 will be  treated as held by a disqualified person through the end of the first  phase (December 31, 1994). However, the foundation voting and value  levels do not increase. Therefore, after the end of the first phase,  F2's holdings in X may not exceed 10 percent (if the combined holdings  of F1, F2 and D exceed the permitted holdings under section 4943(c)(2)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X corporation, an active business corporation, has  outstanding 1,000 shares of its one class of stock. Since 1960, 100  shares (10%) have been held by F, a private foundation and 350 shares  (35%) have been held by D, a disqualified person with respect to F. All  of the stock held by F is permitted holdings under section 4943(c)(4)  and the substituted combined voting and value levels are 45% (10% +  35%). Because of disagreements concerning management of X between D and  A, an unrelated party who holds 300 shares (30%) of the X stock, X  redeems all of A's shares on December 1, 1981.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After the redemption, F holds 14.3% (100/700) of the X stock  and D holds 50% (350/700), for combined holdings of 64.3%. Because the  combined holdings exceed the substituted combined voting level (45%) by  more than F's entire holdings, all of the F stock is excess business  holdings. However, all of F's stock will be treated as acquired other  than by purchase under Sec. 53.4943-6(d)(1) and therefore will be  treated under section 4943(c)(6) and this section, as held by a  disqualified person for five years from the date of the redemption  (through November 30, 1986). If the combined holdings of F and its  disqualified person are reduced to 45 percent by the end of the five  year period, F may retain a portion of its holdings in X (limited to no  more than the foundation voting and value level of 10 percent).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Assume the same facts as in Example (6), except that D  loaned the money to X that was used to redeem A's shares. Under these  facts, the increased holdings result from a prohibited transaction  described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Therefore, all of F's  stock will be treated as acquired by purchase by a disqualified person  under Sec. 53.4943-6(d)(2). F will have 90 days after the redemption in  which to dispose of its holdings or to reduce its holdings and the  combined holdings to the levels held prior to the redemption as  discussed in Example (6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> F, a private foundation, has held 100% of the  outstanding stock of X corporation since 1960. F also holds 15% of the  voting stock of Y corporation. Both X and Y are active business  corporations. X has $1 million in net assets used in its trade or  business and Y has $6.7 million used in its trade or business. On June  1, 1985, Y is merged into X. After the merger F holds 25% of the voting  stock of X. No person other than F controls X after the merger.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because more than 40% of Y was acquired and the net assets of  X, the acquiring corporation, used in its trade or business prior to the  merger represent less than 15% of the net assets of Y used in its trade  or business, the merger is a prohibited transaction described in  paragraph (d)(2)(iii). Therefore, only 15% of the stock X is treated,  pursuant to paragraph (b), as the stock held by F prior to the  redemption. F's holding of 5% (the excess of F's 25% holdings over the  20% permitted holdings in X (determined under section 4943(c)(2)) are  treated as purchased by a disqualified person pursuant to Sec. 53.4943- 6(d)(2). F will have 90 days after June 1, 1985, in which to dispose of  the 5% excess holdings.  [T.D. 7944, 49 FR 6480, Feb. 22, 1984]</p>
