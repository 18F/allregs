                            <p class="depth0">For the purpose of Sec. Sec.  1.670 through 1.673, the following  definitions apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Administrative subdivision of funds. An administrative  subdivision of funds is any administrative subdivision of an  appropriation or fund which makes funds available in a specified amount  for the purpose of controlling apportionments or reapportionments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allotment. An allotment is an authorization by the Director,  Office of Budget and Finance, to department and staff office heads  (allottees) to incur obligations within specified amounts, during a  specified period, pursuant to an Office of Management and Budget  apportionment or reapportionment action. The creation of an obligation  in excess of an allotment is a violation of the administrative  subdivision of funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allowance. An allowance is a subdivision below the allotment  level, and is a guideline which may be issued by department or staff  office heads (allottees) to facility directors and other officials,  showing the expenditure pattern or operating budget they will be  expected to follow in light of the program activities contemplated by  the overall VA budget or plan of expenditure. The creation of an  obligation in excess of an allowance is not a violation of the  administrative subdivision of funds.  (Authority: 31 U.S.C. 1514)</p>
