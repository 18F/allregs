                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Situations in which a power of attorney is required. Except as  otherwise provided in Sec.  601.504(b), a power of attorney is required  by the Internal Revenue Service when the taxpayer wishes to authorize a  recognized representative to perform one or more of the following acts  on behalf of the taxpayer--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Representation. (See Sec. Sec.  601.501(b)(10) and  601.501(b)(13).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Waiver. Offer and/or execution of either</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A waiver of restriction on assessment or collection of a  deficiency in tax, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A waiver of notice of disallowance of a claim for credit or  refund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consent. Execution of a consent to extend the statutory period  for assessment or collection of a tax.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Closing agreement. Execution of a closing agreement under the  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Check drawn on the United States Treasury. The authority to  receive (but not endorse or collect) a check drawn on the United States  Treasury must be specifically granted in a power of attorney. (The  endorsement and payment of a check drawn on the United States Treasury  are governed by Treasury Department Circular No. 21, as amended, 31 CFR  part 240. Endorsement and payment of such check by any person other than  the payee must be made under one of the special types of powers of  attorney prescribed by Circular No. 21, 31 CFR part 240. For  restrictions on the assignment of claims, see Revised Statute section  3477, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3727).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Signing tax returns. The filing of a power of attorney does not  authorize the recognized representative to sign a tax return on behalf  of the taxpayer unless such act is both--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Permitted under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations  thereunder (e.g., the authority to sign income tax returns is governed  by the provisions of Sec.  1.6012-1(a)(5) of the Income Tax  Regulations); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specifically authorized in the power of attorney.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Situations in which a power of attorney is not required--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Disclosure of confidential tax information. The submission of a tax  information authorization to request a disclosure of confidential tax  information does not constitute practice before the Internal Revenue  Service. (Such procedure is governed by the provisions of section 6103  of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.)  Nevertheless, if a power of attorney is properly filed, the recognized  representative also is authorized to receive and/or inspect confidential  tax information concerning the matter(s) specified (provided the power  of attorney places no limitations upon such disclosure).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Estate matter. A power of attorney is not required at a  conference concerning an estate tax matter if the individual seeking to  act as a recognized representative presents satisfactory evidence to  Internal Revenue Service officials that he/she is--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An individual described in Sec.  601.502(b); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The attorney of record for the executor, personal  representative, or administrator before the court where the will is  probated or the estate is administered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Bankruptcy matters. A power of attorney is not required in the  case of a trustee, receiver, or an attorney (designated to represent a  trustee, receiver, or debtor in possession) appointed by a court having  jurisdiction over a debtor. In such a case, Internal Revenue Service  officials may require   the submission of a certificate from the court having jurisdiction over  the debtor showing the appointment and qualification of the trustee,  receiver, or attorney and that his/her authority has not been  terminated. In cases pending before a court of the United States (e.g.,  U.S. District Court or U.S. Bankruptcy Court), an authenticated copy of  the order approving the bond of the trustee, receiver, or attorney will  meet this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Administrative requirements of filing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Except as  provided in this section, a power of attorney (including the declaration  of representative and any other required statement(s)) must be filed in  each office of the Internal Revenue Service in which the recognized  representative desires to perform one or more of the acts described in  Sec.  601.504(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Regional offices. If a power of attorney (including the  declaration of representative and any other required statement(s)) is  filed with the office of a district director or with a service center  which has the matter under consideration, it is not necessary to file a  copy with the office of a regional commissioner which subsequently has  the matter under consideration unless requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> National Office. In case of a request for a ruling or other  matter to be considered in the National Office, a power of attorney,  including the declaration of representative and any other required  statement(s), must be submitted with each request or matter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copy of power of attorney. The Internal Revenue Service will  accept either the original or a copy of a power of attorney. A copy of a  power of attorney received by facsimile transmission (FAX) also will be  accepted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Practice by correspondence. If an individual desires to  represent a taxpayer through correspondence with the Internal Revenue  Service, such individual must submit a power of attorney, including the  declaration of representative and any other required statement(s), even  though no personal appearance is contemplated.
