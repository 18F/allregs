Matter reasonably available to an affected class of persons,  whether published by a private organization or an agency of the United  States, is published in the Federal Register for purposes of paragraph  (a) of this section when it is incorporated by reference in the Federal  Register with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register. Any  matter which is incorporated by reference must be set forth in the  privately- or publicly-printed document substantially in its entirety  and not merely summarized or printed as a synopsis. There can be no  incorporation by reference in the Federal Register of any matter where  only a few persons having a special working knowledge of the activities  of   the United States Customs Service are familiar with its location and  scope. The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and 1 CFR part 20 control  any incorporation of matter by reference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effect of failure to publish.

That is, any matter which imposes an  obligation and which is not published or incorporated by reference can  not adversely change or affect a person's rights.</p>
