                            <p class="depth0">FDA shall evaluate annually the performance of each certification  agency. The evaluation shall include the use of performance indicators  that address the adequacy of program performance in certification,  inspection, and enforcement activities. FDA will also consider any  additional information deemed relevant by FDA that has been provided by  the certification body or other sources or has been required by FDA as  part of its oversight mandate. The evaluation also shall include a  review of any changes in the standards or procedures in the areas listed  in Sec. Sec. 900.21(b) and 900.22 that have taken place since the  original application or the last evaluation, whichever is most recent.  The evaluation shall include a determination of whether there are major  deficiencies in the certification agency's regulations or performance  that, if not corrected, would warrant withdrawal of the approval of the  certification agency under the provisions of Sec. 900.24, or minor  deficiencies that would require corrective action.</p>
