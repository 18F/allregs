                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Monitoring requirements for impingement mortality for existing facilities. The Director may establish monitoring requirements in addition to those specified at Sec. 125.94(c), including, for example, biological monitoring, intake velocity and flow measurements. If the Director establishes such monitoring, the specific protocols will be determined by the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring requirements for entrainment for existing facilities. Monitoring requirements for entrainment will be determined by the Director on a site-specific basis, as appropriate, to meet requirements under Sec. 125.94(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional monitoring requirements for existing facilities. The Director may require additional monitoring for impingement or entrainment including, but not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Director may require additional monitoring if there are changes in operating conditions at the facility

or in the source waterbody that warrant a re-examination of the operational conditions identified at 40 CFR 122.21(r).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Director may require additional monitoring for species not subject to the BTA requirements for impingement mortality at Sec. 125.95(c). Such monitoring requirements will be determined by the Director on a site-specific basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Monitoring requirements for new units at existing facilities. Monitoring is required to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Sec. 125.94(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Director may establish monitoring requirements for impingement, impingement mortality, and entrainment of the commercial, recreational, and forage base fish and shellfish species identified in the Source Water Baseline Biological Characterization data required by 40 CFR 122.21(r)(4). Monitoring methods used must be consistent with those used for the Source Water Baseline Biological Characterization at 40 CFR 122.21(r)(4). If the Director establishes such monitoring requirements, the frequency of monitoring and specific protocols will be determined by the Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If your facility is subject to the requirements of Sec. 125.94(e)(1) or (2), the frequency of flow monitoring and velocity monitoring must be daily and must be representative of normal operating conditions. Flow monitoring must include measuring cooling water withdrawals, make-up water, and blowdown volume. The Director may require additional monitoring necessary to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 125.94(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If your facility is subject to the requirements of Sec. 125.94(e)(2), you must monitor to demonstrate achievement of reductions commensurate with a closed-cycle recirculating system. You must monitor entrainable organisms at a proximity to the intake that is representative of the entrainable organisms in the absence of the intake structure. You must also monitor the latent entrainment mortality in front of the intake structure. Mortality after passing the cooling water intake structure must be counted as 100 percent mortality unless you have demonstrated to the approval of the Director that the mortality for each species is less than 100 percent. Monitoring must be representative of the cooling water intake when the structure is in operation. In addition, sufficient samples must be collected to allow for calculation of annual average entrainment levels of all life stages of fish and shellfish. Specific monitoring protocols and frequency of monitoring will be determined by the Director. You must follow the monitoring frequencies identified by the Director for at least two years after the initial permit issuance. After that time, the Director may approve a request for less frequent monitoring in the remaining years of the permit term and when a subsequent permit is reissued. The monitoring must measure the total count of entrainable organisms or density of organisms, unless the Director approves of a different metric for such measurements. In addition, you must monitor the AIF for each intake. The AIF must be measured at the same time as the samples of entrainable organisms are collected. The Director may require additional monitoring necessary to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 125.94(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Director may require additional monitoring for impingement or entrainment at the cooling water intake structure used by a new unit including, but not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Director may require additional monitoring if there are changes in operating conditions at the facility or in the source waterbody that warrant a re-examination of the operational conditions identified at 40 CFR 122.21(r).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Director may require additional monitoring for species not subject to the BTA requirements for impingement mortality at Sec. 125.95(c). Such monitoring requirements will be determined by the Director on a site-specific basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Visual or remote inspections. You must either conduct visual inspections or employ remote monitoring devices during the period the cooling water intake structure is in operation. You must conduct such inspections at least weekly to ensure that any technologies operated to comply with Sec. 125.94 are maintained and operated to function as

designed including those installed to protect Federally-listed threatened or endangered species or designated critical habitat. The Director may establish alternative procedures if this requirement is not feasible (e.g., an offshore intake, velocity cap, or during periods of inclement weather).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Request for reduced monitoring. For facilities that are subject to Sec. 125.94(c)(7) and where the facility's cooling water intake structure does not directly or indirectly affect Federally-listed threatened and endangered species, or designated critical habitat, the owner or operator of the facility may request the Director to reduce monitoring requirements after the first full permit term in which these monitoring requirements are implemented, on the condition that the results of the monitoring to date demonstrate that the owner or operator of the facility has consistently operated the intake as designed and is meeting the requirements of Sec. 125.94(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Additional monitoring related to Federally-listed threatened and endangered species and designated critical habitat at existing facilities. Where the Director requires additional measures to protect Federally-listed threatened or endangered species or designated critical habitat pursuant to Sec. 125.94(g), the Director shall require monitoring associated with those measures.</p>
