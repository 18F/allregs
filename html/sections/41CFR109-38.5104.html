                            <p class="depth0">No utilization standards are established for motor equipment other than motor vehicles. Each DOE office should establish through an agreement between the fleet manager and the OPMO utilization criteria for other motor equipment including heavy mobile equipment and review, adjust, and approve such criteria annually. Utilization of various classifications of other motor equipment can be measured through various statistics including miles, hours of use, number of trips, and fuel consumption. A utilization review of other motor equipment shall be performed at least annually by the motor equipment fleet manager to justify retainment or disposition of excess equipment not needed to fulfill Departmental, programmatic, health, safety, or security requirements.</p>
