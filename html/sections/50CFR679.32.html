                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section contains requirements for CDQ groups, vessel operators, and managers of processors that harvest or process fixed gear sablefish CDQ, pollock CDQ, or groundfish CDQ. Regulations governing the catch accounting of halibut CDQ are at Sec. 679.40(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> PSQ catch. Time and area closures required once a CDQ group has reached its salmon PSQ or crab PSQ are listed in Sec. 679.7(d)(5). The catch of salmon or crab by vessels using other than trawl gear does not accrue to the PSQ for these species. The discard of halibut by vessels using pot gear, jig gear, or hook-and-line gear to harvest sablefish CDQ will not accrue to the halibut PSQ if this bycatch has been exempted from the halibut PSC limit in the annual BSAI specifications published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fisheries monitoring requirements and catch accounting sources for vessels sablefish, pollock, or groundfish CDQ fishing--(1) Sablefish CDQ fishing with fixed gear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sablefish CDQ fishing with fixed gear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Observer coverage.

Operators and owners of catcher/processors sablefish CDQ fishing must comply with observer coverage requirements at Sec. 679.51(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Data sources used for CDQ catch accounting. NMFS will use the following data sources to account for catch made by vessels sablefish CDQ fishing with fixed gear:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Sablefish CDQ. NMFS will use the same information sources that are used to debit sablefish IFQ accounts (see

Sec. 679.40(h)) to debit fixed gear sablefish CDQ accounts. This information must be reported through standard reporting requirements in Sec. 679.5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Groundfish CDQ.

A completed application is comprised of an application form and a copy of the cooperative contract or an affidavit, as described below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Application form. The application to use alternative CDQ harvest regulations is available on the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at www.alaskafisheries.noaa.gov. All information fields must be accurately completed, including information about the applicant, the voluntary fishing cooperative, and the vessels participating in the voluntary cooperative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Cooperative contract or affidavit. The application must include either a copy of the current voluntary fishing cooperative contract demonstrating participation in the cooperative by the owners of each of the vessels named on the application form or an affidavit that includes the information required in this paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B). NMFS must be able to determine the following information from the voluntary fishing cooperative contract or the affidavit: the name of the authorized representative of the cooperative; the printed names and signatures of each vessel owner that is a party to the voluntary cooperative; the vessel name, FFP number, and LLP license number for each vessel managed under the cooperative; and the target species, processing mode, gear types, and management area(s) associated with the voluntary cooperative's federal fishing operations. If an applicant submits a copy of the voluntary fishing cooperative contract but it does not contain this information, the applicant also must submit a written affidavit that provides all of the information required in this paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) that is not included in the cooperative contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application submission. The application for use of non-CDQ harvest regulations must be submitted to the Regional Administrator per the instructions on the application form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Submittal and duration--(A) Submittal.

An application requesting approval for the use of non-CDQ harvest regulations may be submitted to NMFS at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Duration. Once approved, an application to use alternative CDQ harvest regulations is effective as of the date on which NMFS approves the application. The approval is effective until the requesting entity withdraws its application, or until there is a change in the membership of the voluntary cooperative, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> NMFS review. NMFS will review an application to use non-CDQ harvest regulations to determine that all of the information submitted complies with the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, and that the vessels listed on the application form represent a majority of the vessels participating in the applicable sector. If NMFS determines that the application is deficient, NMFS will notify the applicant in writing to identify the discrepancies and provide the applicant with an opportunity to correct them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> NMFS determinations and administrative appeal. NMFS will approve an application to use non-CDQ harvest regulations when it determines that all of the information submitted with the application complies with the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, the vessels listed on the application form represent a majority of vessels participating in an applicable sector, and the CDQ harvest regulations are more restrictive than the

non-CDQ regulations for the applicable sector. NMFS will issue an initial administrative determination (IAD) disapproving the application and the reasons for its disapproval if the application is incomplete, the voluntary cooperative does not represent a majority of the vessels participating in the sector, or the CDQ harvest regulations are not more restrictive than the non-CDQ regulations for the applicable sector. An applicant who receives an IAD disapproving an application may appeal under the procedures set forth at Sec. 679.43.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Amendments. The entity applied for use of non-CDQ harvest regulations must promptly notify NMFS of any changes in the voluntary fishing cooperative's membership by re-applying in accordance with this paragraph (e).
