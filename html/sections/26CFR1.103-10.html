However, interest on an obligation of such an issue is includable in  gross income if the obligation is held by a substantial user of the  financed facilities or a related person (as described in section  103(b)(7) and Sec. 1.103-11). Section 103(b)(6) only becomes applicable  where the bond issue meets both the trade or business and the security  interest tests so that the obligations are industrial development bonds  within the meaning of section 103(b)(2). For bonds issued before January  1, 1979, in taxable years ending before such date, and for capital  expenditures made before January 1, 1979, with respect to such bonds,  paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall be applied by  substituting $5 million for $10 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> shall not apply to any debt  obligation issued by a State or local governmental unit as part of an  issue where--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate authorized face amount of such issue (determined  by aggregating the outstanding face amount of any prior exempt small  issues described in paragraph (d) of this section and the face amount of  the issue of obligations in question) is $1 million or less; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substantially all of the proceeds of such issue is to be used  for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or improvement of  land or property of a character subject to the allowance for  depreciation under section 167. Proceeds which are loaned to a borrower  for use as working capital or to finance inventory are not used in the  manner described in the preceding sentence. Whether substantially all of  the proceeds of an issue of governmental obligations are used in such  manner is determined consistently with the rules for exempt facilities  in Sec. 1.103-8(a)(1)(i). Any obligation which is an industrial  development bond within the meaning of section 103(b)(2) and which  satisfies the $1 million small issue exemption   requirements is an exempt small issue. See paragraph (c)(1) of this  section for the treatment of refunding issues of $1 million or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2))</em> issued after October 24, 1968.

Special rules for applying such definition  in the case of certain expenditures paid or incurred by a State or local  governmental unit are prescribed in subdivision (iii) of this  subparagraph. Except as excluded by subdivision (iv) or (v) of this  subparagraph, an expenditure (regardless of how paid, whether in cash,  notes, or stock in a taxable or nontaxable transaction) is a section  103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditure if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The capital expenditures were paid or incurred during the 6-year  period which begins 3 years before the date of issuance of the issue in  question and ends 3 years after such date,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The principal user of the facility in connection with which the  property resulting from the capital expenditures is used and the  principal user of the facility financed by the proceeds of the issue in  question is the same person or are two or more related persons (as  defined in section 103(b)(6)(C) and paragraph (e) of this section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Both facilities referred to in (c) of this subdivision were  (during the period described in (b) of this subdivision or a part  thereof) located in the same incorporated municipality or in the same  county outside of the incorporated municipalities in such county), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The capital expenditures were properly chargeable to the capital  account of any person or State or local governmental unit (whether or  not such person is the principal user of the facility or a related  person) determined, for this purpose, without regard to any rule of the  Code which permits expenditures properly chargeable to capital account  to be treated as current expenses. With respect to obligations issued on  or after August 8, 1972, determinations under the preceding sentence  shall be made by including any expenditure which may, under any rule or  election under the Code, be treated as a capital expenditure (whether or  not such expenditure is so treated). With respect to obligations issued  on or after August 8, 1972, for purposes of this subparagraph, capital  expenditures made with respect to a contiguous or integrated facility  which   is located on both sides of a border between two or more political  jurisdictions are made with respect to a facility located in all such  jurisdictions and, therefore, shall be treated as if they were made in  each such political jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amounts properly chargeable to capital account under  subdivision (ii) (e) of this subparagraph include capital expenditures  made by a State or local governmental unit with respect to an exempt  facility or an industrial park, within the 6-year period described in  subdivision (ii)(b) of this subparagraph, out of the proceeds of bond  issues to which section 103(b)(1) did not apply by reason of section  103(b) (4) or (5) (relating to certain exempt activities and industrial  parks). Thus, for example, the cost to the lessor of a leased plantsite  financed out of the proceeds of an issue for an exempt air pollution  control facility under section 103(b)(4)(F) and paragraph (g) of Sec.  1.103-8 would constitute a section 103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditure.  However, in the case of an industrial park, only the land costs  allocated on an area basis to the plantsite and the actual cost of any  improvements made on the plantsite, or to be used principally in  connection with the actual plantsite occupied by a principal user or a  related person, shall be taken into account as capital expenditures.  Where the actual amount of capital expenditures made with respect to a  facility by a person (including a State or local governmental unit)  other than the user of such facility (or a related person) cannot be  ascertained, the fair market value of the property with respect to which  the capital expenditures were made, at the time of such capital  expenditures, shall be deemed to be the amount of such capital  expenditures. In the case of a transaction which is not in form a  purchase but which is treated as a purchase for Federal income tax  purposes, the purchase price for Federal income tax purposes shall  constitute a capital expenditure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A capital expenditure is an excluded expenditure if either it is  made by a public utility company which is not the principal user of the  facility financed by the proceeds of the issue in question (or a related  person) with respect to property of such company, or it is made by a  State or local governmental unit with respect to property of such unit,  and if in either case it meets all of the following three conditions:  Such property of such company or unit (as the case may be) must be used  to provide gas, water, sewage disposal services, electric energy, or  telephone service. Such property must be installed in, or connected to,  the facility but must not consist of property which is such an integral  part of the facility that the cost of such property is ordinarily  included as part of the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction  cost of such facility. Such property must be of a type normally paid for  by the user (or a related person) in the form of periodic fees based  upon time or use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A capital expenditure is an excluded expenditure if it is made  by a person other than the user, a related person, or a State or local  governmental unit and if it is made with respect to tangible personal  property (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.48-1), or  intangible personal property, leased to the user (or a related person)  of a facility. However, the preceding sentence shall apply only if such  personal property is leased by the manufacturer of such tangible or  intangible personal property, or by a person in the trade or business of  leasing property the same as, or similar to, such personal property, and  only if, pursuant to general business practice, property of such type is  ordinarily the subject of a lease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A capital expenditure is an excluded expenditure if it is made  to replace property damaged or destroyed by fire, storm, or other  casualty, to the extent that these expenditures do not exceed in dollar  amount the fair market value (determined immediately before the  casualty) of the property replaced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A capital expenditure is an excluded expenditure if it is  required by a change made after the date of issue in a Federal or State  law, or a local ordinance which has general application, or   if it is required by a change made after such date in rules and  regulations of general application issued under such law or ordinance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> with respect to any issue may not exceed $1 million.  With respect to expenditures incurred prior to December 11, 1971, the  dollar amount specified in the preceding sentence shall be $250,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)(a)</em> If the assets of a corporation are acquired by another  corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) (relating to  carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions) applies, the exchange of  consideration by the acquiring corporation for such assets is not a  section 103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditure by such acquiring corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If section 351(a) applies to a transfer of property to a  corporation solely in exchange for its stock or securities, the issuance  of such stock or securities in such exchange is not a section  103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditure by such corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> However, if such a transfer referred to in (c) of this  subdivision occurs during the 6-year period beginning 3 years before the  date of issuance of an issue of obligations and ending 3 years after  such date, and if, with respect to the property transferred,  expenditures made within such period would have been section  103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditures if the transferor and transferee had  been related persons for such period, then such expenditures shall be  considered to be section 103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditures made by the  transferee. In addition, if a transferor and transferee are related  persons immediately following such transfer, such transferor and  transferee shall also be treated as having been related persons for the  portion of such 6-year period preceding the date of such transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> For purposes of this subdivision (v), the term ``issue of  obligations'' means an issue being tested for purposes of qualifying or  continuing to qualify under an election pursuant to section 103(b)(6)(D)  as to which an amount which would be a section 103(b)(6)(D) capital  expenditure solely by reason of (b) or (d) of this subdivision must be  taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> If with respect to an issue of obligations an expenditure would  not have been a section 103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditure but for the  application of (b) or (d) of this subdivision, and if such section  103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditure has the effect of making taxable the  interest on an issue of obligations which qualified for exemption under  section 103(b)(6)(A) and this paragraph, the loss of tax exemption for  such interest shall begin not earlier than the date of such exchange or  transfer referred to in this subdivision (v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The issuer may make the election provided by section  103(b)(6)(D) and this paragraph (b)(2) (assuming that the bonds  otherwise qualify under section 103(b)(6) by noting the election  affirmatively at or before the time of issuance of the issue in question  on its books or records with respect to the issue. The term ``books or  records'' includes the bond resolution or other similar legislation for  the issue in question as well as the bond transcript or other  compilation of bond and bond-related documents. If the issuer fails to  make an election at the time and in the manner prescribed in this  paragraph (b)(2), the issue will not be treated as described in section  103(b)(6)(D), and interest thereon will be includible in gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Refunding or refinancing issue exemption--(1) $1 million or less  refunding   issue. Section 103(b)(6)(A) also provides that section 103(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> shall  not apply to any debt obligation issued by a State or local governmental  unit as part of an issue the aggregate authorized face amount of which  is $1 million or less, if substantially all of the proceeds of such  issue are to be used--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To redeem part of all of a prior issue substantially all of the  proceeds of which were used to acquire, construct, reconstruct, or  improve land or property of a character subject to the allowance for  depreciation, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To redeem part or all of a prior exempt small refunding issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 10 million or less refinancing issue. Section 103(b)(6)(H)  provides that section 103(b)(1) shall not apply to any debt obligation  issued by a governmental unit as part of an issue which is $10 million  or less if the condition of section 103(b)(6)(H) is met and if  substantially all of the proceeds are to be used--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To redeem part or all of one or more prior exempt small issues,  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> and paragraph (b)(2)(i)(b) of this section to  refinancing issues, section 103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditures are taken  into account only for purposes of determining whether prior issues which  were made under the section 103(b)(6)(D) election qualified under  section 103(b)(6)(A) and would have continued to qualify under that  section but for the redemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Certain prior issues taken into account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section  103(b)(6)(B) provides, in effect, that if (i) a prior issue specified in  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is an exempt small issue (including  for this purpose an exempt small refunding issue) under section  103(b)(6)(A) and this section, and (ii) such prior issue is outstanding  at the time of issuance of a subsequent issue, then in determining the  aggregate face amount of such subsequent issue (for purposes of  determining whether such issue is a $1 million or $10 million exempt  small issue under section 103(b)(6)(A) and this section) there shall be  taken into account the outstanding face amount of such prior exempt  small issue. For purposes of this paragraph, the outstanding face amount  of a prior exempt small issue does not include the face amount of any  obligation which is to be redeemed from the proceeds of such subsequent  issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prior issues specified. The face amount of an outstanding prior  exempt small issue is taken into account under subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The proceeds of both the prior exempt small issue and of the  subsequent issue (whether or not the State or local governmental unit  issuing such obligation is the same unit for each such issue) are or  will be used primarily with respect to facilities located or to be  located in the same incorporated municipality or located or to be  located in the same county outside of an incorporated municipality in  such county (and, for purposes of this subdivision, on or after August  8, 1972, a contiguous or integrated facility which is located on both  sides of a border between two or more political jurisdictions shall be  treated as if it is entirely within each such political jurisdiction),  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The principal user of the financed facilities referred to in  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is or will be the same person or  two or more related persons (as defined in section 103(b)(6)(C) and  paragraph (e) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rules of application. The rules of this paragraph shall apply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Only in the case of outstanding prior exempt small issues which  are industrial development bonds to which section 103(b)(1) would have  applied but for the provisions of section 103(b)(6). Thus, for example,  the provisions of this paragraph do not apply in respect of a prior  issue of obligations issued on or before April 30, 1968. In addition,  the provisions of this paragraph do not   apply in respect of a prior issue for an exempt facility under section  103(b)(4) and Sec. 1.103-8, or for an industrial park under section  103(b)(5) and Sec. 1.103-9, whether or not the issue might also have  qualified as an exempt small issue under section 103(b)(6)(A) and this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To all prior exempt small issues which meet the requirements of  this paragraph. Thus, for example, in determining the aggregate face  amount of an issue under section 103(b)(6)(A), the outstanding face  amount of prior $1 million or $10 million exempt small issues which meet  the requirements of this paragraph shall be taken into account in  determining the aggregate face amount of a subsequent issue being tested  for the $1 million small issue exemption. Similarly, in determining the  aggregate face amount of an issue under section 103(b)(6)(A) and (D),  the outstanding face amount of prior $1 million or $10 million exempt  small issues which meet the requirements of this paragraph shall be  taken into account in determining the aggregate face amount of a  subsequent issue being tested for the $10 million small issue exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Related persons. For purposes of section 103(b) and Sec. Sec.  1.103-7 through 1.103-11, the term ``related person'' means a person who  is related to another person if, on the date of issue of an issue of  obligations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The relationship between such persons would result in a  disallowance of losses under section 267 (relating to disallowance of  losses, etc., between related taxpayers) and section 707(b) (relating to  losses disallowed, etc., between partners and controlled partnerships)  and the regulations thereunder, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such persons are members of the same controlled group of  corporations, as defined in section 1563(a), relating to definition of  controlled group of corporations (except that ``more than 50 percent''  shall be substituted for ``at least 80 percent'' each place it appears  in section 1563(a)) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Disqualification of certain small issues. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 103(b)(6)  shall not apply to any obligation issued after April 24, 1979, which is  part of an issue, a significant portion of the proceeds of which are to  be used directly or indirectly to provide residential real property for  family units. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term  ``residential real property for family units'' means residential rental  projects (within the meaning of Sec. 1.103-8(b)) and owner-occupied  residences (within the meaning of section 103A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of paragraph (f)(1), a significant portion of the  proceeds of an issue are used to provide residential real property for  family units if 5 percent or more of the proceeds are so used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The application of the rules contained in section  103(b)(6) and this section are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. County A and corporation X enter into an arrangement  under which the county will provide a factory which X will lease for 25  years. The arrangement provides (1) that A will issue $1 million of  bonds on March 1, 1970, (2) that the proceeds of the bond issue will be  used to acquire land in County A (but not in an incorporated  municipality) and to construct and equip a factory on such land in  accordance with X's specifications, (3) that X will rent the facility  for 25 years at an annual rental equal to the amount necessary to  amortize the principal and pay the interest on the outstanding bonds,  and (4) that such payments by X and the facility itself shall be the  security for the bonds. Although the bonds issued are industrial  development bonds, the bonds are an exempt small issue under section  103(b)(6)(A) and this section since the aggregate authorized face amount  of the bond issue is $1 million or less and all of the proceeds of the  bond issue are to be used to acquire and improve land and acquire and  construct depreciable property. The result would be the same if the  arrangement provided that X would purchase the facility from A.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example (1) except that,  instead of acquiring land and constructing a new factory, the  arrangement provides that A will acquire a vacant existing factory  building and rebuild and equip the building in accordance with X's  specifications. The bonds are an exempt small issue for the same reasons  as in example (1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example (1) or (2) except  that the financed facilities are additions to facilities which were  financed by an issue of bonds to which section 103(b)(1) does not apply  because such bonds were issued prior to May 1, 1968, or were subject to  the transitional provisions of Sec. 1.103-12. The bonds are an exempt  small   issue since neither of the prior bond issues are taken into account  under section 103(b)(6)(B) and this section in determining the status of  industrial development bonds which are issued after April 30, 1968, and  which are not subject to the transitional provisions of Sec. 1.103-12.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in example (1) except that,  subsequently, corporation X proposes to County A that A build a $400,000  warehouse located in Town M (an unincorporated town located in County A)  for X under terms similar to the factory arrangement described in  example (1). On the proposed issue date of the subsequent bond issue,  $600,000 of the first exempt small issue will be outstanding. If A  issues $400,000 of bonds for such purposes, the bonds will be an exempt  small issue under section 103(b)(6) and this section since, under the  rules of section 103(b)(6)(B) and paragraph (d) of this section, if the  aggregate authorized face amount of the new issue and the outstanding  prior exempt small issue will be $1 million or less, the new issue will  be an exempt small issue. If, however, the aggregate authorized face  amount of the prior issue outstanding on the date of the subsequent  issue were in excess of $600,000, the subsequent issue would not qualify  as an exempt small issue because (1) the combined aggregate face amount  of the outstanding prior issue and the new issue would be in excess of  $1 million, (2) the facilities financed by both issues are to be located  in unincorporated areas in the same county, (3) the same taxpayer will  be the principal user of both facilities, and (4) but for the rules of  section 103(b)(6)(B) and paragraph (d) of this section the prior issue  would be an exempt small issue.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in example (1) except that  subsequently corporation X proposes to City P and City R (incorporated  municipalities located in County A) that P and R each issue bonds and  each build $1 million facilities to be located in Cities P and R for the  use of X under terms similar to the arrangement in example (1). Each of  the $1 million issues will be an exempt small issue because each  proposed facility is located within a different incorporated  municipality and the proceeds of the prior outstanding exempt small  issue were used to construct facilities outside of an incorporated area.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in example (1) except that  $95,000 of the $1 million will be used by the corporation as working  capital. The bonds are an exempt small issue for the same reason as in  example (1) since substantially all of the proceeds will be used for the  acquisition of land and the construction of depreciable property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The facts are the same as in example (1) except that on  November 1, 1969, County A issued $10 million of industrial development  bonds, all of the proceeds of which were issued for the acquisition of  land as the site for an industrial park within the meaning of section  103(b)(5) and Sec. 1.103-9. The proceeds of the $1 million of bonds  issued in 1970 will be used to construct a factory for corporation X to  be located in the industrial park. The bonds issued in 1970 are  industrial development bonds within the meaning of section 103(b)(2) and  Sec. 1.103-7. Since, however, the prior 1969 issue is not an issue to  which section 103(b)(6)(A) applied (see paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this  section), the bonds issued in 1970 are an exempt small issue for the  reasons stated in example (1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. County B enters into three separate arrangements with  three unrelated corporations whereby the county will provide separate  storage facilities for each corporation. The arrangement provides (1)  that the county will issue bonds and loan to each corporation $250,000  of the proceeds which will be used to acquire land in the county and to  construct the facilities, (2) that the rental payments by the  corporations will be equal to the amount necessary to amortize the  principal and pay the interest on any outstanding bonds issued by the  county, and (3) that the payments by the corporations and the facilities  themselves shall be the security for the industrial development bonds.  For convenience, the county issues one series of bonds in the face  amount of $750,000 rather than three separate series of bonds of  $250,000 each. The issue is an exempt small issue under section  103(b)(6)(A) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section since the aggregate  authorized face amount of the bond issue is $1 million or less, and all  of the proceeds of the bond issue are to be used to acquire and improve  land and acquire and construct depreciable property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. City C and corporation Y enter into an arrangement under  which C will provide a factory which Y will lease for 25 years. The  arrangement provides (1) that C will issue $4 million of bonds on March  1, 1969, after making the election under section 103(b)(6)(D) and  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, (2) that the proceeds of the bond  issue will be used to acquire land in the city and to construct and  equip a factory on such land in accordance with Y's specifications, (3)  that Y will rent the facilities for 25 years at an annual rental equal  to the amount necessary to amortize the principal and pay the interest  on the outstanding bonds, (4) that such payments by Y and the facility  itself shall be the security for the bonds, and (5) that, if corporation  Y pays or incurs capital expenditures in excess of $1 million within 3  years from the date of issue which disqualify the bonds as an exempt  small issue under section 103(b)(6)(D), it will either furnish funds to  C to redeem such bonds at par or at a premium, or increase the rental  payments to C in an amount sufficient to pay a premium interest rate.  Although the bonds   issued are industrial development bonds, they are an exempt small issue  under section 103(b)(6)(A) by reason of the election under section  103(b)(6)(D) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, since the aggregate  authorized face amount of the bond issue is $5 million or less and all  of the proceeds of the bond issue are to be used to acquire and improve  land and acquire and construct depreciable property. The provisions for  redemption of the bonds or an increase in rental if the bonds are  disqualified as an exempt small issue under section 103(b)(6)(A) will  not disqualify an otherwise valid election under section 103(b)(6)(D)  and paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. The facts are the same as in example (9) except that  corporation Y subsequently proposed to the city that it build a $1  million warehouse next to the plant for the use of Y under terms similar  to the factory arrangement. Assume further that the factory building was  completed by March 1, 1970, and that on January 15, 1972, the proposed  issue date of the subsequent bond issue, $2 million of the first exempt  small issue will be outstanding. In determining the aggregate authorized  face amount of the new issue, the original face amount of a prior  outstanding issue must be reduced by that portion which is to be  redeemed before it is added to the face amount of the new issue.  Therefore, if the city issues $3 million of bonds to redeem the  remaining $2 million of bonds and to construct the warehouse the bonds  will be an exempt small issue under section 103(b)(6)(A) if an election  is made under section 103(b)(6)(D) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section  since (1) the face amount of the new issue ($3 million), plus (2) the  face amount of the prior outstanding exempt small issue minus the amount  of such issue to be refunded ($2 million minus $2 million), plus (3)  capital expenditures during the preceding 3 years financed other than  out of the proceeds of outstanding issues to which section 103(b)(6)(A)  and paragraph (b) of this section applied ($2 million), do not exceed $5  million. If, however, the amount of the January 15, 1972, issue were  $3\1/2\ million, the issue would not qualify as an exempt small issue  under section 103(b)(6)(A) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. The facts are the same as in example (9), except that on  June 15, 1971, Y purchases from an unrelated motor carrier business a  warehouse terminal in the same city at a cost of $250,000 and tractor- trailers and other automotive equipment based at the terminal at a cost  of $1 million. This subsequent expenditure by Y has the effect of making  the interest on the city C bonds includable in the gross income of the  holders of such bonds as of June 15, 1971, because the face amount of  the March 1, 1969, issue ($4 million) plus the subsequent capital  expenditures within 3 years of the date of issue ($1,250,000) exceed $5  million. (See section 103(b)(6)(D) and paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this  section.)</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. The facts are the same as in example (9), except that in  March, 1970, Y will move $3 million of additional used machinery and  equipment into the factory from its factory in another city. The  expenditures for such machinery and equipment were incurred by Y more  than 3 years prior to the date of issue of the bonds. The transfer of  such used equipment into city C does not constitute a section  103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditure within the meaning of paragraph  (b)(2)(ii) of this section since the expenditures with respect to such  property were incurred more than 3 years prior to the date of issue of  the bonds. Had the capital expenditures with respect to such property  been incurred during the 6-year period beginning 3 years before the date  of issue of the bonds and in the 3 years after such date, they would  constitute section 103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditures.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13. The facts are the same as in example (9), except that in  March 1970, corporation Y enters into an arrangement with respect to  machinery and equipment to be used in the facility. The arrangement is  labeled by the parties as a lease but is treated as a sale for Federal  income tax purposes. The amount treated as the purchase price of the  machinery and equipment is a section 103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditure.</p><p class="depth0">Example 14. On February 1, 1970, city D issues $5 million of its  bonds to finance construction of an addition to the manufacturing plant  of corporation Z. The bonds will be secured by the facility and lease  payments to be made by Z which will be sufficient to pay the principal  and interest on such bonds. Assume that the bonds qualify as an exempt  small issue under section 103(b)(6)(A) pursuant to an election under  section 103(b)(6)(D) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section. On February  1, 1971, D plans to issue $1 million of its bonds to construct a  pollution control facility to be leased to Z for use at its  manufacturing plant. The rental payments from the lease will be  sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the bonds. The bonds  will be secured by such facility and the lease payments. Capital  expenditures for the pollution control facility will be paid or incurred  beginning before February 1, 1973. Although the pollution control  facility is an exempt facility under section 103(b)(4)(F) and paragraph  (g) of Sec. 1.103-8, amounts used for the pollution control facility  shall be considered to be a section 103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditure and  the interest on the February 1, 1970, issue will become taxable as of  the date such capital expenditure began to be paid or incurred. See  section 103(b)(6)(G) and paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 15. On February 1, 1970, City E issues $500,000 of its bonds  to acquire and develop an industrial park within the meaning of section  103(b)(5) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.103-9. The park consists of 100  acres and is divided into one 50 acre plantsite and 4 smaller sites. The  aggregate acquisition cost of the undeveloped land is $150,000 or an  average per acre cost of $1,500. Roads, sidewalks, sewers, utilities,  sewage, and waste disposal facilities serving the entire industrial park  cost $300,000. On September 1, 1970, E leases to corporation Y for 30  years the 50 acre plantsite (with an allocated cost of $75,000) and a  railroad spur track from the railroad right of way to Y's plantsite for  Y's exclusive use. The spur track was constructed using $50,000 of the  proceeds of the industrial park bond issue. E also proposes to issue on  September 1, 1970, $4,875,000 of its bonds to construct and equip a  building on the leased plantsite to be leased to Y at an additional  rental sufficient to pay the principal and interest on this issue of  bonds. The September 1, 1970, issue will be an exempt small issue under  section 103(b)(6)(A) pursuant to an election under section 103(b)(6)(D)  and paragraph (b)(2) of this section since the sum of the amount of the  second issue ($4,875,000) and the capital expenditures allocated to the  plantsite ($75,000 for 50 acres of land plus $50,000 for the railroad  spur tract, totaling $125,000) does not exceed $5 million. The sum of  $300,000 which was spent in development of the industrial park provided  facilities which will serve or benefit the users generally and hence  under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section is not considered to have  provided facilities as to which Y will be the principal user.</p><p class="depth0">Example 16. On June 1, 1970, corporation Z simultaneously enters  into separate arrangements with City F and City G under which each city  will issue a $5 million exempt small issue of bonds the proceeds of  which will be used by Z to construct separate facilities in each city.  By June 1, 1971, the facilities have been completed in the respective  cities. On January 1, 1972, Cities F and G, through a valid legal  proceeding, merge into a new City FG. Since in this case F and G were  separate cities on June 1, 1970 (the date of the bond issues), the  factories are not considered to be located in the same incorporated  municipality. Accordingly, each $5 million issue by City F and G will  continue to qualify as an exempt small issue.</p><p class="depth0">Example 17. On June 1, 1973, City H issues an exempt small issue of  $4.75 million to finance a facility of corporation S to be located in  City H. On October 1, 1974, S and corporation T, previously unrelated to  S, consummated a statutory merger which qualifies as a reorganization  described in section 368(a)(1)(A) and thus as a transaction described in  section 381(a). In the transaction, T transferred to S assets with a  fair market value of $1.5 million in exchange for stock of S, $300,000  of securities of S, and $100,000 cash. On March 23, 1971, T made  $400,000 of capital expenditures for an addition to its factory located  in City H. For purposes of testing the H issue of June 1, 1973, such  expenditures would have been section 103(b)(6)(D) capital expenditures  if T and S had been related persons. Under the provisions of paragraph  (b)(2)(v)(a) of this section, the exchange of $1.5 million of stock,  securities, and cash by S does not constitute a section 103(b)(6)(D)  capital expenditure. Since, however, S and T are treated as related  persons starting 3 years prior to the date of issue of the obligations,  the $400,000 of expenditures by T constitute section 103(b)(6)(D)  capital expenditures. Thus, the interest on the June 1, 1973, issue of  obligations would become taxable (since the $5 million limit would be  exceeded) on the date of the merger.</p><p class="depth0">Example 18. In 1965 City I issues $10 million of industrial  development bonds to construct and equip a factory for corporation Z. In  1975 the remaining principal amount of the bonds outstanding is $4.1  million. If I issues $4.5 million of bonds to redeem the balance of the  prior issue, and for other purposes, such issue cannot qualify as an  exempt small issue under section 103(b)(6)(D) and paragraph (b)(2) of  this section even though at the time of issue the interest on the 1965  bonds was tax-exempt since the prior issue must be one which qualified  under section 103(b)(6)(A) and this section. Further, the 1975 issue  will be an issue of industrial development bonds notwithstanding the  provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 1.103-7 which provides that  certain bonds issued to refund an issue of obligations issued on or  before April 30, 1968 (or January 1, 1969, in certain cases) will not be  so treated. Paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 1.103-7 is not applicable because  the 1975 issue makes funds available for a purpose other than the debt  service obligation on the 1965 bonds.</p><p class="depth0">Example 19. In 1969 City J issues $4 million of industrial  development bonds which qualify as an exempt small issue under section  103(b)(6)(A) pursuant to an election under section 103(b)(6)(D) and  paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In 1971, by reason of a $2 million  addition to the factory built with the proceeds of the issue, the 1969  exempt small issue loses its tax-exempt status. In 1972, the city issues  a $5 million issue to redeem the prior 1969 issue. The redemption issue  will not qualify as an exempt small issue since   the prior 1969 issue did not continue to qualify under section  103(b)(6)(A) and this section.
