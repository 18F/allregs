                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. VA will approve an eligible child's pursuit of a vocational training program at a rate consistent with his or her ability to successfully pursue training, considering:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Effects of his or her disability;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Family responsibilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Travel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reasonable adjustment to training; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other circumstances affecting the child's ability to pursue training.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(c), 1814)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Continuous pursuit. An eligible child should pursue a program of vocational training with as little interruption as necessary, considering the factors in paragraph (a) of this section.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(c), 1814)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responsibility for determining the rate of pursuit. VR&E; staff members will consult with the child when determining the rate and continuity of pursuit of a vocational training program. These staff members will also confer with the medical consultant and the Vocational Rehabilitation Panel described in Sec. Sec. 21.60 and 21.62, as necessary. This rate and continuity of pursuit determination will occur during

development of the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation, but may change later, as necessary to enable the child to complete training.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(c), 1814)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Measurement of training time used. VA will measure the rate of pursuit in a comparable manner to rate of pursuit measurement under Sec. 21.310 for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program.
