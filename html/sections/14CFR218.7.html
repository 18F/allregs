                            <p class="depth0">Whether under a particular lease agreement the lessor of the  aircraft is engaged in foreign air transportation is a question of fact  to be determined in the light of all the facts and circumstances.  However, in circumstances where the lessor furnishes both the aircraft  and the crew, there is a presumption that true operational control and  safety responsibility are exercised by the lessor, and that the  agreement constitutes a charter arrangement under which the lessor is  engaged in foreign air transportation. The burden shall rest upon the  applicants for disclaimer of jurisdiction in each instance to  demonstrate by an appropriate factual showing that the operation  contemplated will not constitute foreign air transportation by the  lessor.</p>
