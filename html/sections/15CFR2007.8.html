                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As soon after the beginning of each calendar year as relevant trade data for the preceding year are available, modifications of the GSP in accordance with section 504(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 as amended (19 U.S.C. 2464) will be considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General review. Section 504(c)(2) of Title V of the Trade Act of 1974 as amended (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)(2)) requires that not later than January 4, 1987 and periodically thereafter, the President conduct a general review of eligible articles based on the considerations in sections 501 and 502 of Title V. The purpose of these reviews is to determine which articles from which beneficiary countries are ``sufficiently competitive'' to warrant a reduced competitive need limit. Those articles determined to be ``sufficiently competitive'' will be subject to a new lower competitive need limit set at 25 percent of the value of total U.S imports of the article, or $25 million (this figure will be adjusted annually in accordance with nominal changes in U.S. gross national product (GNP), using 1984 as the base year). All other articles will continue to be subject to the original competitive need limits of 50 percent or $25 million (this figure is adjusted annually using 1974 as the base year).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Scope of general reviews. In addition to an examination the competitiveness of specific articles from particular beneficiary countries, the general review will also include consideration of requests for competitive need limit waivers pursuant to section 504(c)(3)(A) of Title V of the Trade Act of 1974 as amended (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)) and requests for a determination of no domestic production under section 504(d)(1) of Title V of the Trade Act of 1974 as amended (19 U.S.C. 2464(d)(1)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Factors to be considered. In determining whether a beneficiary country should be subjected to the lower competitive need limits with respect to a particular article, the President shall consider the following factors contained in sections 501 and 502(c) of Title V:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The effect such action will have on furthering the economic development of developing countries through expansion of their exports;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The extent to which other major developed countries are undertaking a comparable effort to assist developing countries by granting generalized preferences with respect to imports of products of such countries;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The anticipated impact of such action on the United States producers of like or directly competitive products;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The extent of the beneficiary developing country's competitiveness with respect to eligible articles;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The level of economic development of such country, including its per capita GNP, the living standard of its inhabitants and any other economic factors the President deems appropriate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Whether or not the other major developed countries are extending generalized preferential tariff treatment to such country;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The extent to which such country has assured the United States it will provide equitable and reasonable access to the markets and basic commodity resources of such country and the extent to which such country has assured the United States that it will refrain from engaging in unreasonable export practices;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The extent to which such country is providing adequate and effective means under its laws for foreign nationals to secure, to exercise and to enforce exclusive rights in intellectual property, including patents, trademarks and copyrights;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The extent to which such country has taken action to--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Reduce trade distorting investment practices and policies (including export performance requirements); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Reduce or eliminate barriers to trade in services; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Whether or not such country has taken or is taking steps to afford workers in that country (including any designated zone in that country) internationally recognized worker rights.</p>
