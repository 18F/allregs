                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determinations made by SSA. The following rules and those under paragraph (b) of this section apply where an individual has applied for Medicaid on the basis of disability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the agency has an agreement with the Social Security Administration (SSA) under section 1634 of the Act, the agency may not make a determination of disability when the only application is filed with SSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency may not make an independent determination of disability if SSA has made a disability determination within the time limits set forth in Sec.  435.912 on the same issues presented in the Medicaid application. A determination of eligibility for SSI payments based on disability that is made by SSA automatically confers Medicaid eligibility, as provided for under Sec.  435.909.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect of SSA determinations. (1) Except in the circumstances specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except in the circumstances specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An SSA disability determination is binding on an agency until the determination is changed by SSA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the SSA determination is changed, the new determination is also binding on the agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency must refer to SSA all applicants who allege new information or evidence affecting previous SSA determinations of ineligibility based

upon disability for reconsideration or reopening of the determination, except in cases specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determinations made by the Medicaid agency. The agency must make a determination of disability in accordance with the requirements of this section if any of the following circumstances exist:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The individual applies for Medicaid as a non-cash beneficiary and has not applied to SSA for SSI cash benefits, whether or not a State has a section 1634 agreement with SSA; or an individual applies for Medicaid and has applied to SSA for SSI benefits and is found ineligible for SSI for a reason other than disability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The individual applies both to SSA for SSI and to the State Medicaid agency for Medicaid, the State agency has a section 1634 agreement with SSA, and SSA has not made an SSI disability determination within 90 days from the date of the individual's application for Medicaid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The individual applies to SSA for SSI and to the State Medicaid agency for Medicaid, the State does not have a section 1634 agreement with SSA, and either the State uses more restrictive criteria than SSI for determining Medicaid eligibility under its section 1902(f) option or, in the case of a State that uses SSI criteria, SSA has not made an SSI disability determination in time for the State to comply with the Medicaid time limit for making a prompt determination on an individual's application for Medicaid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The individual applies for Medicaid as a non-cash beneficiary, whether or not the State has a section 1634 agreement with SSA, and--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Alleges a disabling condition different from, or in addition to, that considered by SSA in making its determination; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Alleges more than 12 months after the most recent SSA determination denying disability that his or her condition has changed or deteriorated since that SSA determination and alleges a new period of disability which meets the durational requirements of the Act, and has not applied to SSA for a determination with respect to these allegations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Alleges less than 12 months after the most recent SSA determination denying disability that his or her condition has changed or deteriorated since that SSA determination, alleges a new period of disability which meets the durational requirements of the Act, and--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Has applied to SSA for reconsideration or reopening of its disability decision and SSA refused to consider the new allegations; and/or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> He or she no longer meets the nondisability requirements for SSI but may meet the State's nondisability requirements for Medicaid eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Basis for determinations. The agency must make a determination of disability as provided in paragraph (c) of this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On the basis of the evidence required under paragraph (e) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In accordance with the requirements for evaluating that evidence under the SSI program specified in 20 CFR 416.901 through 416.998.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Medical and nonmedical evidence. The agency must obtain a medical report and other nonmedical evidence for individuals applying for Medicaid on the basis of disability. The medical report and nonmedical evidence must include diagnosis and other information in accordance with the requirements for evidence applicable to disability determinations under the SSI program specified in 20 CFR part 416, subpart I.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disability review teams--(1) Function. A review team must review the medical report and other evidence required under paragraph (e) of this section and determine on behalf of the agency whether the individual's condition meets the definition of disability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Function. A review team must review the medical report and other evidence required under paragraph (e) of this section and determine on behalf of the agency whether the individual's condition meets the definition of disability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Composition. The review team must be composed of a medical or psychological consultant and another individual who is qualified to interpret and evaluate medical reports and other evidence relating to the individual's physical or mental impairments and, as necessary, to determine the capacities of the individual to perform substantial gainful activity, as specified in 20 CFR part 416, subpart J.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Periodic reexaminations. The review team must determine whether and when reexaminations will be necessary

for periodic redeterminations of eligibility as required under Sec.  435.916 of this part, using the principles set forth in 20 CFR 416.989 and 416.990. If a State uses the same definition of disability as SSA, as provided for under Sec.  435.540, and a beneficiary is Medicaid eligible because he or she receives SSI, this paragraph (f)(3) does not apply. The reexamination will be conducted by SSA.
