                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Following the receipt of an acceptable request for facility  clearance, the NRC will either accept an existing facility clearance  granted by a current CSA and authorize possession of license or  certificate related classified information, or process the facility for  a facility clearance. Processing will include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A determination based on review and approval of a Standard  Practice Procedures Plan that granting of the   Facility Clearance would not be inconsistent with the national interest,  including a finding that the facility is not under foreign ownership,  control, or influence to such a degree that a determination could not be  made. An NRC finding of foreign ownership, control, or influence is  based on factors concerning the foreign intelligence threat, risk of  unauthorized technology transfer, type and sensitivity of the  information that requires protection, the extent of foreign influence,  record of compliance with pertinent laws, and the nature of  international security and information exchange agreements. The  licensee, certificate holder, or other person must advise the NRC within  30 days of any significant events or changes that may affect its status  concerning foreign ownership, control, or influence (e.g., changes in  ownership; changes that affect the company's answers to original FOCI  questions; indebtedness; and changes in the required form that  identifies owners, officers, directors, and executive personnel).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An acceptable security review conducted by the NRC;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Submitting key management personnel for personnel clearances  (PCLs); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Appointing a U.S. citizen employee as the facility security  officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An interim Facility Clearance may be granted by the CSA on a  temporary basis pending completion of the full investigative  requirements.
