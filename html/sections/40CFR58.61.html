1. General Information2. Quality System Requirements3. Measurement Quality Check Requirements4. Calculations for Data Quality Assessments5. Reporting Requirements6. References</p><p class="depth0">1. General Information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Each monitoring organization is required to implement a quality system that provides sufficient information to assess the quality of the monitoring data. The quality system must, at a minimum, include the specific requirements described in this appendix of this subpart. Failure to conduct or pass a required check or procedure, or a series of required checks or procedures, does not by itself invalidate data for regulatory decision making. Rather, monitoring agencies and EPA shall use the checks and procedures required in this appendix in combination with other data quality information, reports, and similar documents showing overall compliance with part 58. Accordingly, EPA and monitoring agencies shall use a ``weight of evidence'' approach when determining the suitability of data for regulatory decisions. The EPA reserves the authority to use or not use monitoring data submitted by a monitoring organization when making regulatory decisions based on the EPA's assessment of the quality of the data. Generally, consensus built validation templates or validation criteria already approved in Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPPs) should be used as the basis for the weight of evidence approach.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> This appendix specifies the minimum quality system requirements applicable to SLAMS air monitoring data and PSD data for the pollutants SO2, NO2, O3, CO, Pb, PM 2.5, PM 10 and PM 10-2.5 submitted to EPA. This appendix also applies to all SPM stations using FRM, FEM, or ARM methods which also meet the requirements of appendix E of this part, unless alternatives to this appendix for SPMs have been approved in accordance with Sec. 58.11(a)(2). Monitoring organizations are encouraged to develop and maintain quality systems more extensive than the required minimums. The permit-granting authority for PSD may require more frequent or more stringent requirements. Monitoring organizations may, based on their quality objectives, develop and maintain quality systems beyond the required minimum. Additional guidance for the requirements reflected in this appendix can be found in the ``Quality Assurance Handbook for Air Pollution Measurement Systems'', Volume II (see reference 10 of this appendix) and at a national level in references 1, 2, and 3 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Similarities and Differences Between SLAMS and PSD Monitoring. In most cases, the quality assurance requirements for SLAMS, SPMs if applicable, and PSD are the same. Affected SPMs are subject to all the SLAMS requirements, even where not specifically stated in each section. Table A-1 of this appendix summarizes the major similarities and differences of the requirements for SLAMS and PSD. Both programs require:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The development, documentation, and implementation of an approved quality system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The assessment of data quality;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The use of reference, equivalent, or approved methods. The requirements of this appendix do not apply to a SPM that does not use a FRM, FEM, or ARM;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The use of calibration standards traceable to NIST or other primary standard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Performance evaluations and systems.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.1 The monitoring and quality assurance responsibilities for SLAMS are with the State or local agency, hereafter called the monitoring organization, whereas for PSD they are with the owner/operator seeking the permit. The monitoring duration for SLAMS is indefinite, whereas for PSD the duration is usually 12 months. Whereas the reporting period for precision and accuracy data is on an annual or calendar quarter basis for SLAMS, it is on a continuing sampler quarter basis for PSD, since the monitoring may not commence at the beginning of a calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.2 The annual performance evaluations (described in section 3.2.2 of this appendix) for PSD must be conducted by personnel different from those who perform routine span checks and calibrations, whereas for SLAMS, it is the preferred but not the required condition. For PSD, the evaluation rate is 100 percent of the sites per reporting quarter whereas for SLAMS it is 25 percent of the sites or instruments quarterly. Monitoring for sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for PSD must be done with automated analyzers--the manual bubbler methods are not permitted.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.3 The requirements for precision assessment for the automated methods are the same for both SLAMS and PSD. However, for manual methods, only one collocated site is required for PSD.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.4 The precision, accuracy and bias data for PSD are reported separately for each sampler (site), whereas for SLAMS, the report may be by sampler (site), by primary quality assurance organization, or nationally, depending on the pollutant. SLAMS data are required to be reported to the AQS, PSD data are required to be reported to the permit-granting authority. Requirements in this appendix, with the exception of the differences discussed in this section, and in Table A-1 of this appendix will be expected to be followed by both SLAMS and PSD networks unless directly specified in a particular section.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Measurement Uncertainty. Measurement uncertainty is a term used to describe deviations from a true concentration or estimate that are related to the measurement process and not to spatial or temporal population attributes of the air being measured. Monitoring organizations must develop quality assurance project plans (QAPP) which describe how the organization intends to control measurement uncertainty to an appropriate level in order to achieve the objectives for which the data are collected. The process by which one determines the quality of data needed to meet the monitoring objective is sometimes referred to the Data Quality Objectives Process. Data quality indicators associated with measurement uncertainty include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Precision. A measurement of mutual agreement among individual measurements of the same property usually under prescribed similar conditions, expressed generally in terms of the standard deviation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Bias. The systematic or persistent distortion of a measurement process which causes errors in one direction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Accuracy. The degree of agreement between an observed value and an accepted reference value. Accuracy includes a combination of random error (imprecision) and systematic error (bias) components which are due to sampling and analytical operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Completeness. A measure of the amount of valid data obtained from a measurement system compared to the amount that was expected to be obtained under correct, normal conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Detectability. The low critical range value of a characteristic that a method specific procedure can reliably discern.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 Measurement Quality Checks. The SLAMS measurement quality checks described in sections 3.2 and 3.3 of this appendix shall be reported to AQS and are included in the data required for certification. The PSD network is required to implement the measurement quality checks and submit this information quarterly along with assessment information to the permit-granting authority.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Assessments and Reports. Periodic assessments and documentation of data quality are required to be reported to EPA or to the permit granting authority (PSD). To provide national uniformity in this assessment and reporting of data quality for all networks, specific assessment and reporting procedures are prescribed in detail in sections 3, 4, and 5 of this appendix. On the other hand, the selection and extent of the quality assurance and quality control activities used by a monitoring organization depend on a number of local factors such as field and laboratory conditions, the objectives for monitoring, the level of data quality needed, the expertise of assigned personnel, the cost of control procedures, pollutant concentration levels, etc. Therefore, quality system requirements in section 2 of this appendix are specified in general terms to allow each monitoring organization to develop a quality system that is most efficient and effective for its own circumstances while achieving the data quality objectives required for the SLAMS sites.</p><p class="depth0">2. Quality System Requirements</p><p class="depth0">A quality system is the means by which an organization manages the quality of the monitoring information it produces in a systematic, organized manner. It provides a framework for planning, implementing, assessing and reporting work performed by an organization and for carrying out required

quality assurance and quality control activities.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Quality Management Plans and Quality Assurance Project Plans. All monitoring organizations must develop a quality system that is described and approved in quality management plans (QMP) and quality assurance project plans (QAPP) to ensure that the monitoring results:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Meet a well-defined need, use, or purpose;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Provide data of adequate quality for the intended monitoring objectives;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Satisfy stakeholder expectations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Comply with applicable standards specifications;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Comply with statutory (and other) requirements of society; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Reflect consideration of cost and economics.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.1 The QMP describes the quality system in terms of the organizational structure, functional responsibilities of management and staff, lines of authority, and required interfaces for those planning, implementing, assessing and reporting activities involving environmental data operations (EDO). The QMP must be suitably documented in accordance with EPA requirements (reference 2 of this appendix), and approved by the appropriate Regional Administrator, or his or her representative. The quality system will be reviewed during the systems audits described in section 2.5 of this appendix. Organizations that implement long-term monitoring programs with EPA funds should have a separate QMP document. Smaller organizations or organizations that do infrequent work with EPA funds may combine the QMP with the QAPP based on negotiations with the funding agency. Additional guidance on this process can be found in reference 10 of this appendix. Approval of the recipient's QMP by the appropriate Regional Administrator or his or her representative, may allow delegation of the authority to review and approve the QAPP to the recipient, based on adequacy of quality assurance procedures described and documented in the QMP. The QAPP will be reviewed by EPA during systems audits or circumstances related to data quality.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2 The QAPP is a formal document describing, in sufficient detail, the quality system that must be implemented to ensure that the results of work performed will satisfy the stated objectives. The quality assurance policy of the EPA requires every environmental data operation (EDO) to have a written and approved QAPP prior to the start of the EDO. It is the responsibility of the monitoring organization to adhere to this policy. The QAPP must be suitably documented in accordance with EPA requirements (reference 3 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3 The monitoring organization's quality system must have adequate resources both in personnel and funding to plan, implement, assess and report on the achievement of the requirements of this appendix and its approved QAPP.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Independence of Quality Assurance. The monitoring organization must provide for a quality assurance management function- that aspect of the overall management system of the organization that determines and implements the quality policy defined in a monitoring organization's QMP. Quality management includes strategic planning, allocation of resources and other systematic planning activities (e.g., planning, implementation, assessing and reporting) pertaining to the quality system. The quality assurance management function must have sufficient technical expertise and management authority to conduct independent oversight and assure the implementation of the organization's quality system relative to the ambient air quality monitoring program and should be organizationally independent of environmental data generation activities.</p><p class="depth0">2.3. Data Quality Performance Requirements.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1 Data Quality Objectives. Data quality objectives (DQO) or the results of other systematic planning processes are statements that define the appropriate type of data to collect and specify the tolerable levels of potential decision errors that will be used as a basis for establishing the quality and quantity of data needed to support the objectives of the SLAMS stations. DQO will be developed by EPA to support the primary SLAMS objectives for each criteria pollutant. As they are developed they will be added to the regulation. DQO or the results of other systematic planning processes for PSD or other monitoring will be the responsibility of the monitoring organizations. The quality of the conclusions made from data interpretation can be affected by population uncertainty (spatial or temporal uncertainty) and measurement uncertainty (uncertainty associated with collecting, analyzing, reducing and reporting concentration data). This appendix focuses on assessing and controlling measurement uncertainty.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1.1 Measurement Uncertainty for Automated and Manual PM 2.5 Methods. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined as 10 percent coefficient of variation (CV) for total precision and plus or minus 10 percent for total bias.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1.2 Measurement Uncertainty for Automated Ozone Methods. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the coefficient variation (CV) of 7 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 7 percent.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1.3 Measurement Uncertainty for PM 10-2.5 Methods. The goal for acceptable

measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the coefficient variation (CV) of 15 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 15 percent.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1.4 Measurement Uncertainty for Pb Methods. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the coefficient variation (CV) of 20 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 15 percent.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1.5 Measurement Uncertainty for NO2. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the coefficient of variation (CV) of 15 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 15 percent.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1.6 Measurement Uncertainty for SO2. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty for precision is defined as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the coefficient of variation (CV) of 10 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 National Performance Evaluation Programs. Monitoring plans or the QAPP shall provide for the implementation of a program of independent and adequate audits of all monitors providing data for SLAMS and PSD including the provision of adequate resources for such audit programs. A monitoring plan (or QAPP) which provides for monitoring organization participation in EPA's National Performance Audit Program (NPAP) and the PM Performance Evaluation Program (PEP) program and which indicates the consent of the monitoring organization for EPA to apply an appropriate portion of the grant funds, which EPA would otherwise award to the monitoring organization for monitoring activities, will be deemed by EPA to meet this requirement. For clarification and to participate, monitoring organizations should contact either the appropriate EPA Regional Quality Assurance (QA) Coordinator at the appropriate EPA Regional Office location, or the NPAP Coordinator at the Air Quality Assessment Division, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.</p><p class="depth0">2.5 Technical Systems Audit Program. Technical systems audits of each ambient air monitoring organization shall be conducted at least every 3 years by the appropriate EPA Regional Office and reported to the AQS. Systems audit programs are described in reference 10 of this appendix. For further instructions, monitoring organizations should contact the appropriate EPA Regional QA Coordinator.</p><p class="depth0">2.6 Gaseous and Flow Rate Audit Standards.</p><p class="depth0">2.6.1 Gaseous pollutant concentration standards (permeation devices or cylinders of compressed gas) used to obtain test concentrations for carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) must be traceable to either a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Traceable Reference Material (NTRM) or a NIST-certified Gas Manufacturer's Internal Standard (GMIS), certified in accordance with one of the procedures given in reference 4 of this appendix. Vendors advertising certification with the procedures provided in reference 4 of this appendix and distributing gasses as ``EPA Protocol Gas'' must participate in the EPA Protocol Gas Verification Program or not use ``EPA'' in any form of advertising.</p><p class="depth0">2.6.2 Test concentrations for ozone (O3) must be obtained in accordance with the ultra violet photometric calibration procedure specified in appendix D to part 50 of this chapter, or by means of a certified O3 transfer standard. Consult references 7 and 8 of this appendix for guidance on primary and transfer standards for O3.</p><p class="depth0">2.6.3 Flow rate measurements must be made by a flow measuring instrument that is traceable to an authoritative volume or other applicable standard. Guidance for certifying some types of flowmeters is provided in reference 10 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">2.7 Primary Requirements and Guidance. Requirements and guidance documents for developing the quality system are contained in references 1 through 10 of this appendix, which also contain many suggested procedures, checks, and control specifications. Reference 10 of this appendix describes specific guidance for the development of a quality system for SLAMS. Many specific quality control checks and specifications for methods are included in the respective reference methods described in part 50 of this chapter or in the respective equivalent method descriptions available from EPA (reference 6 of this appendix). Similarly, quality control procedures related to specifically designated reference and equivalent method analyzers are contained in the respective operation or instruction manuals associated with those analyzers.</p><p class="depth0">3. Measurement Quality Check Requirements</p><p class="depth0">This section provides the requirements for primary quality assurance organizations (PQAOs) to perform the measurement quality checks that can be used to assess data quality. With the exception of the flow rate verifications (sections 3.2.3 and 3.3.2 of this appendix), data from these checks are required to be submitted to the AQS within the same time frame as routine ambient concentration data. Section 3.2 of this appendix describes checks of automated or continuous instruments while section 3.3 describe checks

associated with manual sampling instruments. Other quality control samples are identified in the various references described earlier and can be used to control certain aspects of the measurement system.</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Primary Quality Assurance Organization. A primary quality assurance organization is defined as a monitoring organization or a coordinated aggregation of such organizations that is responsible for a set of stations that monitors the same pollutant and for which data quality assessments can logically be pooled. Each criteria pollutant sampler/monitor at a monitoring station in the SLAMS network must be associated with one, and only one, primary quality assurance organization.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Each primary quality assurance organization shall be defined such that measurement uncertainty among all stations in the organization can be expected to be reasonably homogeneous, as a result of common factors. Common factors that should be considered by monitoring organizations in defining primary quality assurance organizations include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Operation by a common team of field operators according to a common set of procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Use of a common QAPP or standard operating procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Common calibration facilities and standards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Oversight by a common quality assurance organization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Support by a common management, laboratory or headquarters.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 Primary quality assurance organizations are not necessarily related to the organization reporting data to the AQS. Monitoring organizations having difficulty in defining the primary quality assurance organizations or in assigning specific sites to primary quality assurance organizations should consult with the appropriate EPA Regional Office. All definitions of primary quality assurance organizations shall be subject to final approval by the appropriate EPA Regional Office during scheduled network reviews or systems audits.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.3 Data quality assessment results shall be reported as specified in section 5 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Measurement Quality Checks of Automated Methods. Table A-2 of this appendix provides a summary of the types and frequency of the measurement quality checks that will be described in this section.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1 One-Point Quality Control Check for SO2, NO2, O3, and CO. A one-point quality control (QC) check must be performed at least once every 2 weeks on each automated analyzer used to measure SO2, NO2, O3 and CO. The frequency of QC checks may be reduced based upon review, assessment and approval of the EPA Regional Administrator. However, with the advent of automated calibration systems more frequent checking is encouraged. See Reference 10 of this appendix for guidance on the review procedure. The QC check is made by challenging the analyzer with a QC check gas of known concentration (effective concentration for open path analyzers) between 0.01 and 0.10 parts per million (ppm) for SO2, NO2, and O3, and between 1 and 10 ppm for CO analyzers. The ranges allow for appropriate check gas selection for SLAMS sites that may be sampling for different objectives, i.e., trace gas monitoring vs. comparison to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The QC check gas concentration selected should be related to the routine concentrations normally measured at sites within the monitoring network in order to appropriately reflect the precision and bias at these routine concentration ranges. To check the precision and bias of SLAMS analyzers operating at ranges either above or below the levels identified, use check gases of appropriate concentrations as approved by the appropriate EPA Regional Administrator or their designee. The standards from which check concentrations are obtained must meet the specifications of section 2.6 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1 Except for certain CO analyzers described below, point analyzers must operate in their normal sampling mode during the QC check, and the test atmosphere must pass through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners and other components used during normal ambient sampling and as much of the ambient air inlet system as is practicable. If permitted by the associated operation or instruction manual, a CO point analyzer may be temporarily modified during the QC check to reduce vent or purge flows, or the test atmosphere may enter the analyzer at a point other than the normal sample inlet, provided that the analyzer's response is not likely to be altered by these deviations from the normal operational mode. If a QC check is made in conjunction with a zero or span adjustment, it must be made prior to such zero or span adjustments.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.2 Open path analyzers are tested by inserting a test cell containing a QC check gas concentration into the optical measurement beam of the instrument. If possible, the normally used transmitter, receiver, and as appropriate, reflecting devices should be used during the test and the normal monitoring configuration of the instrument should be altered as little as possible to accommodate the test cell for the test. However, if permitted by the associated operation or instruction manual, an alternate local light source or an alternate optical path that does not include the normal atmospheric monitoring path may be used. The actual concentration of the QC check gas in the test cell must be selected to produce an effective concentration in the range specified earlier in this section. Generally, the QC test

concentration measurement will be the sum of the atmospheric pollutant concentration and the QC test concentration. If so, the result must be corrected to remove the atmospheric concentration contribution. The corrected concentration is obtained by subtracting the average of the atmospheric concentrations measured by the open path instrument under test immediately before and immediately after the QC test from the QC check gas concentration measurement. If the difference between these before and after measurements is greater than 20 percent of the effective concentration of the test gas, discard the test result and repeat the test. If possible, open path analyzers should be tested during periods when the atmospheric pollutant concentrations are relatively low and steady.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.3 Report the audit concentration (effective concentration for open path analyzers) of the QC gas and the corresponding measured concentration (corrected concentration, if applicable, for open path analyzers) indicated by the analyzer. The percent differences between these concentrations are used to assess the precision and bias of the monitoring data as described in sections 4.1.2 (precision) and 4.1.3 (bias) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.2 Annual performance evaluation for SO2, NO2, O3, or CO. Each calendar quarter (during which analyzers are operated), evaluate at least 25 percent of the SLAMS analyzers that monitor for SO2, NO2, O3, or CO such that each analyzer is evaluated at least once per year. If there are fewer than four analyzers for a pollutant within a primary quality assurance organization, it is suggested to randomly evaluate one or more analyzers so that at least one analyzer for that pollutant is evaluated each calendar quarter. The evaluation should be conducted by a trained experienced technician other than the routine site operator.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.2.1 (a) The evaluation is made by challenging the analyzer with audit gas standard of known concentration (effective concentration for open path analyzers) from at least three consecutive audit levels. The audit levels selected should represent or bracket 80 percent of ambient concentrations measured by the analyzer being evaluated:

NO concentrations substantially higher than 0.08 ppm, as may occur when using some gas phase titration (GPT) techniques, may lead to evaluation errors in chemiluminescence analyzers due to inevitable minor NO-NOX channel imbalance. Such errors may be atypical of routine monitoring errors to the extent that such NO concentrations exceed typical ambient NO concentrations at the site. These errors may be minimized by modifying the GPT technique to lower the NO concentrations remaining in the NO2 audit gas to levels closer to typical ambient NO concentrations at the site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> To evaluate SLAMS analyzers operating on ranges higher than 0 to 1.0 ppm for SO2, NO2, and O3 or 0 to 50 ppm for CO, use audit gases of appropriately higher concentration as approved by the appropriate EPA Regional Administrator or the Administrator's designee.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.2.3 The standards from which audit gas test concentrations are obtained must meet the specifications of section 2.6 of this appendix. The gas standards and equipment used for evaluations must not be the same as the standards and equipment used for calibration or calibration span adjustments. For SLAMS sites, the auditor should not be the operator or analyst who conducts the routine monitoring, calibration, and analysis. For PSD sites the auditor must not be the operator or analyst who conducts the routine monitoring, calibration, and analysis.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.2.4 For point analyzers, the evaluation shall be carried out by allowing the analyzer to analyze the audit gas test atmosphere in its normal sampling mode such that the test atmosphere passes through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other sample inlet components used during normal ambient sampling and as much of the ambient air inlet system as is practicable. The exception provided in section 3.2.1 of this appendix for certain CO analyzers does not apply for evaluations.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.2.5 Open path analyzers are evaluated by inserting a test cell containing the various audit gas concentrations into the optical measurement beam of the instrument. If possible, the normally used transmitter, receiver, and, as appropriate, reflecting devices should be used during the evaluation, and the normal monitoring configuration of the instrument should be modified as little as possible to accommodate the test cell for the evaluation. However, if permitted by the associated operation or instruction manual, an alternate local light source or an alternate optical path that does not include the normal atmospheric monitoring path may be used. The actual concentrations of the audit gas in the test cell must be selected to produce effective concentrations in the evaluation level ranges specified in this section of this appendix. Generally, each evaluation concentration measurement result will be the sum of the atmospheric pollutant concentration and the evaluation test concentration. If so, the result must be corrected to remove the atmospheric concentration contribution. The corrected concentration is obtained by subtracting the average of the atmospheric concentrations measured by the open path instrument under test immediately before and immediately after the evaluation test (or preferably before and after each evaluation concentration level) from the evaluation concentration measurement. If the difference between the before and after measurements is greater than 20 percent of the effective concentration of the test gas standard, discard the test result for that concentration level and repeat the test for that level. If possible, open path analyzers should be evaluated during periods when the atmospheric pollutant concentrations are relatively low and steady. Also, if the open path instrument is not installed in a permanent manner, the monitoring path length must be reverified to within plus or minus 3 percent to validate the evaluation, since the monitoring path length is critical to the determination of the effective concentration.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.2.6 Report both the evaluation concentrations (effective concentrations for open path analyzers) of the audit gases and the corresponding measured concentration (corrected concentrations, if applicable, for open path analyzers) indicated or produced by the analyzer being tested. The percent differences between these concentrations are used to assess the quality of the monitoring data as described in section 4.1.4 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.3 Flow Rate Verification for Particulate Matter. A one-point flow rate verification check must be performed at least once every month on each automated analyzer used to measure PM 10, PM 10-2.5 and PM 2.5. The verification is made by checking the operational flow rate of the analyzer. If the verification is made in conjunction with a flow rate adjustment, it must be made prior to such flow rate adjustment. Randomization of the flow rate verification with respect to time of day, day of week, and routine service and adjustments is encouraged where possible. For the standard procedure, use a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix to check the analyzer's normal flow rate. Care should be used in selecting and using the flow rate measurement device such that it does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the analyzer. Report the flow rate of the transfer standard and the corresponding flow rate measured (indicated) by the analyzer. The percent differences between the audit and measured flow rates are used to assess the bias of the monitoring data as described in section 4.2.2 of this appendix (using flow rates in lieu of concentrations).</p><p class="depth0">3.2.4 Semi-Annual Flow Rate Audit for Particulate Matter. Every 6 months, audit the flow rate of the PM 10, PM 10-2.5 and PM 2.5 particulate analyzers. Where possible, EPA strongly encourages more frequent auditing. The audit should (preferably) be conducted by a trained experienced technician other than the routine site operator. The audit is made by measuring the analyzer's normal operating flow rate using a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix. The flow rate standard used for auditing must not be the same flow rate standard used to calibrate the analyzer. However, both the calibration standard and the audit standard may be referenced to the same primary flow rate or volume standard. Great care must be used in auditing the flow rate to be certain that the flow measurement device does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the analyzer. Report the audit flow rate of the transfer standard and the corresponding flow rate measured (indicated) by the analyzer. The percent differences between these flow rates are used to validate the one-point flow rate verification checks used to estimate bias as described in section 4.2.3 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.5 Collocated Sampling Procedures for PM 2.5.

Follow the procedure described in section 4.1.3 of this appendix for the bias estimate of PM 10-2.5. The PM 2.5 bias estimate is calculated using the paired routine and the PEP monitor data described in section 3.2.6 of this appendix. Calculate the percent difference, di, using equation 1 of this appendix, where meas is the measured concentration from agency's primary monitor and audit is the concentration from the PEP monitor. The data pair would only be considered valid if both concentrations are greater than the minimum values specified in section 4(c) of this appendix. Estimates of bias are presented for various levels of aggregation, sometimes aggregating over time, sometimes aggregating over samplers, and sometimes aggregating over both time and samplers. These various levels of aggregation are achieved using the same basic statistic.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.2.1 This statistic averages the individual biases described in equation 1 of this appendix to the desired level of aggregation using equation 12 of this appendix:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.050

Reporting Requirements</p><p class="depth0">5.1 SLAMS Reporting Requirements. For each pollutant, prepare a list of all monitoring sites and their AQS site identification codes in each primary quality assurance organization and submit the list to the appropriate EPA Regional Office, with a copy to AQS. Whenever there is a change in this list of monitoring sites in a primary quality assurance organization, report this change to the EPA Regional Office and to AQS.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1 Quarterly Reports. For each quarter, each primary quality assurance organization shall report to AQS directly (or via the appropriate EPA Regional Office for organizations not direct users of AQS) the results of all valid measurement quality checks it has carried out during the quarter. The quarterly reports must be submitted consistent with the data reporting requirements specified for air quality data as set forth in Sec. 58.16. The EPA strongly encourages early submission of the quality assurance data in order to assist the monitoring organizations control and evaluate the quality of the ambient air data.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2 Annual Reports.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2.1 When the monitoring organization has certified relevant data for the calendar year, EPA will calculate and report the measurement uncertainty for the entire calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 PSD Reporting Requirements. At the end of each sampling quarter, the organization must report the appropriate statistical assessments in section 4 of this appendix for the pollutants measured. All data used to calculate reported estimates of precision and bias including span checks, collocated sampler and audit results must be made available to the permit granting authority upon request.</p><p class="depth0">6.0 References</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> American National Standard--Specifications and Guidelines for Quality Systems for Environmental Data Collection and Environmental Technology Programs.

There shall be no requirement for tests at any other sites.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.1.2 For purposes of this section, a full year of testing may begin and end in any season, so long as all seasons are covered.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.1.3 No PM 10 samplers shall be required for the test, as determination of the PM 2.5/PM 10 ratio at the test site shall not be required.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.1.4 The test specification for PM 2.5 Class III equivalent method precision defined in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter applies; however, there is no specific requirement that collocated continuous monitors be operated for purposes of generating a statistic for coefficient of variation (CV). To provide an estimate of precision that meets the requirement identified in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter, agencies may cite peer-reviewed published data or data in AQS that can be presented demonstrating the candidate ARM operated will produce data that meets the specification for precision of Class III PM 2.5 methods.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.1.5 A minimum of 90 valid sample pairs per site for the year with no less than 20 valid sample pairs per season must be generated for use in demonstrating that additive bias, multiplicative bias and correlation meet the comparability requirements specified in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter. A valid sample pair may be generated with as little as one valid FRM and one valid candidate ARM measurement per day.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.1.6 For purposes of determining bias, FRM data with concentrations less than 3 micrograms per cubic meter (g/m\3\) may be excluded. Exclusion of data does not result in failure of sample completeness specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.1.7 Data transformations are allowed to be used to demonstrate meeting the comparability requirements specified in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter. Data transformation may be linear or non-linear, but must be applied in the same way to all sites used in the testing.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.2 The monitoring agency wishing to use an ARM must develop and implement appropriate quality assurance procedures for the method. Additionally, the following procedures are required for the method:</p><p class="depth0">2.4.2.1 The ARM must be consistently operated throughout the network. Exceptions to a consistent operation must be approved according to section 2.8 of this appendix;</p><p class="depth0">2.4.2.2 The ARM must be operated on an hourly sampling frequency capable of providing data suitable for aggregation into daily 24-hour average measurements;</p><p class="depth0">2.4.2.3 The ARM must use an inlet and separation device, as needed, that are already approved in either the reference method identified in appendix L to part 50 of this chapter or under part 53 of this chapter as approved for use on a PM 2.5 reference or equivalent method. The only exceptions to this requirement are those methods that by their inherent measurement principle may not need an inlet or separation device that segregates the aerosol; and</p><p class="depth0">2.4.2.4 The ARM must be capable of providing for flow audits, unless by its inherent measurement principle, measured flow is not required. These flow audits are to be performed on the frequency identified in appendix A to this part.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.2.5 If data transformations are used, they must be described in the monitoring agencies Quality Assurance Project plan (or addendum to QAPP). The QAPP shall describe how often (e.g., quarterly, yearly) and under what provisions the data transformation will be updated. For example, not meeting the data quality objectives for a site over a season or year may be cause for recalculating a data transformation, but by itself would not be cause for invalidating the data. Data transformations must be applied prospectively, i.e., in real-time or near real-time, to the data output from the PM 2.5 continuous method. See reference 7 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.3 The monitoring agency wishing to use the method must develop and implement appropriate procedures for assessing and reporting the precision and accuracy of the method comparable to the procedures set forth in appendix A of this part for designated reference and equivalent methods.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.4 Assessments of data quality shall follow the same frequencies and calculations as required under section 3 of appendix A to this part with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth0">2.4.4.1 Collocation of ARM with FRM/FEM samplers must be maintained at a minimum of 30 percent of the required SLAMS sites with a minimum of 1 per network;</p><p class="depth0">2.4.4.2 All collocated FRM/FEM samplers must maintain a sample frequency of at least 1 in 6 sample days;</p><p class="depth0">2.4.4.3 Collocated FRM/FEM samplers shall be located at the design value site, with the required FRM/FEM samplers deployed among the largest MSA/CSA in the network, until all required FRM/FEM are deployed; and</p><p class="depth0">2.4.4.4 Data from collocated FRM/FEM are to be substituted for any calendar quarter that an ARM method has incomplete data.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.4.5 Collocation with an ARM under this part for purposes of determining the coefficient of variation of the method shall be conducted at a minimum of 7.5 percent of the sites with a minimum of 1 per network.

Monitoring Objectives and Spatial Scales</p><p class="depth0">The purpose of this appendix is to describe monitoring objectives and general criteria to be applied in establishing the required SLAMS ambient air quality monitoring stations and for choosing general locations for additional monitoring sites. This appendix also describes specific requirements for the number and location of FRM, FEM, and ARM sites for specific pollutants, NCore multipollutant sites, PM 10 mass sites, PM 2.5 mass sites, chemically-speciated PM 2.5 sites, and O3 precursor measurements sites (PAMS). These criteria will be used by EPA in evaluating the adequacy of the air pollutant monitoring networks.</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Monitoring Objectives. The ambient air monitoring networks must be designed to meet three basic monitoring objectives. These basic objectives are listed below. The appearance of any one objective in the order of this list is not based upon a prioritized scheme. Each objective is important and must be considered individually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Provide air pollution data to the general public in a timely manner. Data can be presented to the public in a number of attractive ways including through air quality maps, newspapers, Internet sites, and as part of weather forecasts and public advisories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Support compliance with ambient air quality standards and emissions strategy development. Data from FRM, FEM, and ARM monitors for NAAQS pollutants will be used for comparing an area's air pollution levels against the NAAQS. Data from monitors of various types can be used in the development of attainment and maintenance plans. SLAMS, and especially NCore station data, will be used to evaluate the regional air quality models used in developing emission strategies, and to track trends in air pollution abatement control measures' impact on improving air quality. In monitoring locations near major air pollution sources, source-oriented monitoring data can provide insight into how well industrial sources are controlling their pollutant emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Support for air pollution research studies. Air pollution data from the NCore network can be used to supplement data collected by researchers working on health effects assessments and atmospheric processes, or for monitoring methods development work.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.1 In order to support the air quality management work indicated in the three basic air monitoring objectives, a network must be designed with a variety of types of monitoring sites. Monitoring sites must be

capable of informing managers about many things including the peak air pollution levels, typical levels in populated areas, air pollution transported into and outside of a city or region, and air pollution levels near specific sources. To summarize some of these sites, here is a listing of six general site types:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Sites located to determine the highest concentrations expected to occur in the area covered by the network.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Sites located to measure typical concentrations in areas of high population density.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Sites located to determine the impact of significant sources or source categories on air quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Sites located to determine general background concentration levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Sites located to determine the extent of regional pollutant transport among populated areas; and in support of secondary standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Sites located to measure air pollution impacts on visibility, vegetation damage, or other welfare-based impacts.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.2 This appendix contains criteria for the basic air monitoring requirements. The total number of monitoring sites that will serve the variety of data needs will be substantially higher than these minimum requirements provide. The optimum size of a particular network involves trade-offs among data needs and available resources. This regulation intends to provide for national air monitoring needs, and to lend support for the flexibility necessary to meet data collection needs of area air quality managers. The EPA, State, and local agencies will periodically collaborate on network design issues through the network assessment process outlined in Sec. 58.10.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.3 This appendix focuses on the relationship between monitoring objectives, site types, and the geographic location of monitoring sites. Included are a rationale and set of general criteria for identifying candidate site locations in terms of physical characteristics which most closely match a specific monitoring objective. The criteria for more specifically locating the monitoring site, including spacing from roadways and vertical and horizontal probe and path placement, are described in appendix E to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To clarify the nature of the link between general monitoring objectives, site types, and the physical location of a particular monitor, the concept of spatial scale of representativeness is defined. The goal in locating monitors is to correctly match the spatial scale represented by the sample of monitored air with the spatial scale most appropriate for the monitoring site type, air pollutant to be measured, and the monitoring objective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Thus, spatial scale of representativeness is described in terms of the physical dimensions of the air parcel nearest to a monitoring site throughout which actual pollutant concentrations are reasonably similar. The scales of representativeness of most interest for the monitoring site types described above are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Microscale--Defines the concentrations in air volumes associated with area dimensions ranging from several meters up to about 100 meters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Middle scale--Defines the concentration typical of areas up to several city blocks in size with dimensions ranging from about 100 meters to 0.5 kilometer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Neighborhood scale--Defines concentrations within some extended area of the city that has relatively uniform land use with dimensions in the 0.5 to 4.0 kilometers range. The neighborhood and urban scales listed below have the potential to overlap in applications that concern secondarily formed or homogeneously distributed air pollutants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Urban scale--Defines concentrations within an area of city-like dimensions, on the order of 4 to 50 kilometers. Within a city, the geographic placement of sources may result in there being no single site that can be said to represent air quality on an urban scale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Regional scale--Defines usually a rural area of reasonably homogeneous geography without large sources, and extends from tens to hundreds of kilometers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> National and global scales--These measurement scales represent concentrations characterizing the nation and the globe as a whole.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Proper siting of a monitor requires specification of the monitoring objective, the types of sites necessary to meet the objective, and then the desired spatial scale of representativeness. For example, consider the case where the objective is to determine NAAQS compliance by understanding the maximum ozone concentrations for an area. Such areas would most likely be located downwind of a metropolitan area, quite likely in a suburban residential area where children and other susceptible individuals are likely to be outdoors. Sites located in these areas are most likely to represent an urban scale of measurement. In this example, physical location was determined by considering ozone precursor emission patterns, public activity, and meteorological characteristics affecting ozone formation and dispersion. Thus, spatial scale of representativeness was not used in the selection process but was a result of site location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In some cases, the physical location of a site is determined from joint consideration of both the basic monitoring objective and the type of monitoring site desired, or required by this appendix. For example, to determine PM 2.5 concentrations which are typical over a geographic area having relatively high PM 2.5 concentrations, a neighborhood

scale site is more appropriate. Such a site would likely be located in a residential or commercial area having a high overall PM 2.5 emission density but not in the immediate vicinity of any single dominant source. Note that in this example, the desired scale of representativeness was an important factor in determining the physical location of the monitoring site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> In either case, classification of the monitor by its type and spatial scale of representativeness is necessary and will aid in interpretation of the monitoring data for a particular monitoring objective (e.g., public reporting, NAAQS compliance, or research support).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Table D-1 of this appendix illustrates the relationship between the various site types that can be used to support the three basic monitoring objectives, and the scales of representativeness that are generally most appropriate for that type of site.</p><p class="depth0">Table D-1 of Appendix D to Part 58--Relationship Between Site Types and</p><p class="depth0">Scales of Representativeness------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Site type                    Appropriate siting scales------------------------------------------------------------------------1.

General Monitoring Requirements</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The National ambient air monitoring system includes several types of monitoring stations, each targeting a key data collection need and each varying in technical sophistication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Research grade sites are platforms for scientific studies, either involved with health or welfare impacts, measurement methods development, or other atmospheric studies. These sites may be collaborative efforts between regulatory agencies and researchers with specific scientific objectives for each. Data from these sites might be collected with both traditional and experimental techniques, and data collection might involve specific laboratory analyses not common in routine measurement programs. The research grade sites are not required by regulation; however, they are included here due to their important role in supporting the air quality management program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The NCore multipollutant sites are sites that measure multiple pollutants in order to provide support to integrated air quality management data needs. NCore sites include both neighborhood and urban scale measurements in general, in a selection of metropolitan areas and a limited number of more rural locations. Continuous monitoring methods are to be used at the NCore sites when available for a pollutant to be measured, as it is important to have data collected over common time periods for integrated analyses. NCore multipollutant sites are intended to be long-term sites useful for a variety of applications including air quality trends analyses, model evaluation, and tracking metropolitan area statistics. As such, the NCore sites should be placed away from direct emission sources that could substantially impact the ability to detect area-wide concentrations. The Administrator must approve the NCore sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Monitoring sites designated as SLAMS sites, but not as NCore sites, are intended to address specific air quality management interests, and as such, are frequently single-pollutant measurement sites. The EPA Regional Administrator must approve the SLAMS sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> This appendix uses the statistical-based definitions for metropolitan areas provided by the Office of Management and Budget and the Census Bureau. These areas are referred to as metropolitan statistical areas (MSA), micropolitan statistical areas, core-based statistical areas (CBSA), and combined statistical areas (CSA). A CBSA associated with at least one urbanized area of 50,000 population or greater is termed a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). A CBSA associated with at least one urbanized cluster of at least 10,000 population or greater is termed a Micropolitan Statistical Area. CSA consist of two or more adjacent CBSA. In this appendix, the term MSA is used to refer to a Metropolitan Statistical Area. By definition, both MSA and CSA have a high degree of integration; however, many such areas cross State or other political boundaries. MSA and CSA may also cross more than one air shed. The EPA recognizes that State or local agencies must consider MSA/CSA boundaries and their own political boundaries and geographical characteristics in designing their air monitoring networks. The EPA recognizes that there may be situations where the EPA Regional Administrator and the affected State or local agencies may need to augment or to divide the overall MSA/CSA monitoring responsibilities and requirements among these various agencies to achieve an effective network design. Full monitoring requirements apply separately to each affected State or local agency in the absence of an agreement between the affected agencies and the EPA Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">3. Design Criteria for NCore Sites</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Each State (i.e. the fifty States, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) is required to operate at least one NCore site. States may delegate this requirement to a local agency. States with many MSAs often also have multiple air sheds with unique characteristics and, often, elevated air pollution. These States include, at a minimum, California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. These States are required to identify one to two additional NCore sites in order to account for their unique situations. These additional sites shall be located to avoid proximity to large emission sources. Any State or local agency can propose additional candidate NCore sites or modifications to these requirements for approval by the Administrator. The NCore locations should be leveraged with other multipollutant air monitoring sites including PAMS sites, National Air Toxics Trends Stations (NATTS) sites, CASTNET sites, and STN sites. Site leveraging includes using the same monitoring platform and equipment to meet the objectives of the variety of programs where possible and advantageous.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The NCore sites must measure, at a minimum, PM 2.5 particle mass using continuous and integrated/filter-based samplers, speciated PM 2.5, PM 10-2.5 particle mass, speciated PM 10-2.5, O3, SO2, CO, NO/NOy, wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, and ambient temperature. NCore sites in CBSA with a population of 500,000 people (as determined in the latest Census) or greater shall also measure Pb either as Pb-TSP or Pb-PM 10. The EPA Regional Administrator may approve an alternative location for the Pb measurement where the alternative location would be more appropriate for logistical reasons and the measurement would provide data on typical Pb concentrations in the CBSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Although the measurement of NOy is required in support of a number of monitoring objectives, available commercial instruments may indicate little difference in their measurement of NOy compared to the conventional measurement of NOX, particularly in areas with relatively fresh sources of nitrogen emissions. Therefore, in areas with negligible expected difference between NOy and NOX measured concentrations, the Administrator may allow for waivers that permit NOX monitoring to be substituted for the required NOy monitoring at applicable NCore sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> EPA recognizes that, in some cases, the physical location of the NCore site may not be suitable for representative meteorological measurements due to the site's physical surroundings. It is also possible that nearby meteorological measurements may be able to fulfill this data need. In these cases, the requirement for meteorological monitoring can be waived by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Siting criteria are provided for urban and rural locations. Sites with significant historical records that do not meet siting criteria may be approved as NCore by the Administrator. Sites with the suite of NCore measurements that are explicitly designed for other monitoring objectives are exempt from these siting criteria (e.g., a near-roadway site).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Urban NCore stations are to be generally located at urban or neighborhood scale to provide representative concentrations of exposure expected throughout the metropolitan area; however, a middle-scale site may be acceptable in cases where the site can represent many such locations throughout a metropolitan area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rural NCore stations are to be located to the maximum extent practicable at a regional or larger scale away from any large local emission source, so that they represent ambient concentrations over an extensive area.</p><p class="depth0">4. Pollutant-Specific Design Criteria for SLAMS Sites</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> State, and where appropriate, local agencies must operate O3 sites for various locations depending upon area size (in terms of population and geographic characteristics) and typical peak concentrations (expressed in percentages below, or near the O3 NAAQS). Specific SLAMS O3 site minimum requirements are included in Table D-2 of this appendix. The NCore sites are expected to complement the O3 data collection that takes place at single-pollutant SLAMS sites, and both types of sites can be used to meet the network minimum requirements. The total number of O3 sites needed to support the basic monitoring objectives of public data reporting, air quality mapping, compliance, and understanding O3-related atmospheric processes will include more sites than these minimum numbers required in Table D-2 of this appendix. The EPA Regional Administrator and the responsible State or local air monitoring agency must work together to design and/or maintain the most appropriate O3 network to service the variety of data needs in an area.</p><p class="depth0">Table D-2 of Appendix D to Part 58-- SLAMS Minimum O3 Monitoring</p><p class="depth0">Requirements------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Most recent 3-year</p><p class="depth0">design value     Most recent 3-year</p><p class="depth0">concentrations       design value</p><p class="depth0">MSA population \1 2\          "85% of any O3      concentrations</p><p class="depth0">NAAQS \3\        <85% of any O3</p><p class="depth0">NAAQS \3 4\------------------------------------------------------------------------>10 million.....................                  4                   24-10 million....................                  3                   1350,000-<4 million..............                  2                   1</p><p class="depth0">50,000-<350,000 \5\.............                  1                   0------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ Minimum monitoring requirements apply to the Metropolitan</p><p class="depth0">statistical area (MSA).\2\ Population based on latest available census figures.\3\ The ozone (O3) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) levels</p><p class="depth0">and forms are defined in 40 CFR part 50.\4\ These minimum monitoring requirements apply in the absence of a</p><p class="depth0">design value.\5\ Metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) must contain an urbanized area</p><p class="depth0">of 50,000 or more population.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Within an O3 network, at least one O3 site for each MSA, or CSA if multiple MSAs are involved, must be designed to record the maximum concentration for that particular metropolitan area. More than one maximum concentration site may be necessary in some areas. Table D-2 of this appendix does not account for the full breadth of additional factors that would be considered in designing a complete O3 monitoring program for an area. Some of these additional factors include geographic size, population density, complexity of terrain and meteorology, adjacent O3 monitoring programs, air pollution transport from neighboring areas, and measured air quality in comparison to all forms of the O3 NAAQS (i.e., 8-hour and 1-hour forms). Networks must be designed to account for all of these area characteristics. Network designs must be re-examined in periodic network assessments. Deviations from the above O3 requirements are allowed if approved by the EPA Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The appropriate spatial scales for O3 sites are neighborhood, urban, and regional. Since O3 requires appreciable formation time, the mixing of reactants and products occurs over large volumes of air, and this reduces the importance of monitoring small scale spatial variability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Neighborhood scale--Measurements in this category represent conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-region, with dimensions of a few kilometers. Homogeneity refers to pollutant concentrations. Neighborhood scale data will provide valuable information for developing, testing, and revising concepts and models that describe urban/regional concentration patterns. These data will be useful to the understanding and definition of processes that take periods of hours to occur and hence involve considerable mixing and transport. Under stagnation conditions, a site located in the neighborhood scale may also experience peak concentration levels within a metropolitan area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Urban scale--Measurement in this scale will be used to estimate concentrations over large portions of an urban area with dimensions of several kilometers to 50 or more kilometers. Such measurements will be used for determining trends, and designing area-wide control strategies. The urban scale sites would also be used to measure high concentrations downwind of the area having the highest precursor emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Regional scale--This scale of measurement will be used to typify concentrations over large portions of a metropolitan area and even larger areas with dimensions of as much as hundreds of kilometers. Such measurements will be useful for assessing the O3 that is transported to and from a metropolitan area, as well as background concentrations. In some situations, particularly when considering very large metropolitan areas with complex source mixtures, regional scale sites can be the maximum concentration location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> EPA's technical guidance documents on O3 monitoring network design should be used to evaluate the adequacy of each existing O3 monitor, to relocate an existing site, or to locate any new O3 sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> For locating a neighborhood scale site to measure typical city concentrations, a reasonably homogeneous geographical area near the center of the region should be selected which is also removed from the influence of major NOX sources. For an urban scale site to measure the high concentration areas, the emission inventories should be used to define the extent of the area of important nonmethane hydrocarbons and NOX emissions. The meteorological conditions that occur during periods of maximum photochemical activity should be determined. These periods can be identified by examining the meteorological conditions that occur on the highest O3 air quality days. Trajectory analyses, an evaluation of wind and emission patterns on high O3 days, can also be useful in evaluating an O3 monitoring network. In areas without any previous O3 air quality measurements, meteorological and O3 precursor emissions information would be useful.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Once the meteorological and air quality data are reviewed, the prospective maximum concentration monitor site should be selected in a direction from the city that is most likely to observe the highest O3 concentrations, more specifically, downwind during periods of photochemical activity. In many cases, these maximum concentration O3 sites will be located 10 to 30 miles or more downwind from the urban area where maximum O3 precursor emissions originate. The downwind direction and appropriate distance should be determined from historical meteorological data collected on days which show the potential for producing high O3 levels. Monitoring agencies are to consult with their EPA Regional Office when considering siting a maximum O3 concentration site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> In locating a neighborhood scale site which is to measure high concentrations, the same procedures used for the urban scale are followed except that the site should be located closer to the areas bordering on the center city or slightly further downwind in an area of high density population.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> For regional scale background monitoring sites, similar meteorological analysis as for the maximum concentration sites may also inform the decisions for locating regional scale sites. Regional scale sites may be located to provide data on O3 transport between cities, as background sites, or for other data collection purposes. Consideration of both area characteristics, such as meteorology, and the data collection objectives, such as transport, must be jointly considered for a regional scale site to be useful.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Since O3 levels decrease significantly in the colder parts of the year in many areas, O3 is required to be monitored at SLAMS monitoring sites only during the ``ozone season'' as designated in the AQS files on a State-by-State basis and described below in Table D-3 of this appendix. Deviations from the O3 monitoring season must be approved by the EPA Regional Administrator, documented within the annual monitoring network plan, and updated in AQS. Information on how to analyze O3 data to support a change to the O3 season in support of the 8-hour standard for a specific State can be found in reference 8 to this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Table D-3 of Appendix D to Part 58--Ozone Monitoring Season by State------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">State                   Begin month          End month------------------------------------------------------------------------Alabama.........................

If a CBSA has more than one required near-road NO2 monitor, only one CO monitor is required to be collocated with a near-road NO2 monitor within that CBSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If a state provides quantitative evidence demonstrating that peak ambient CO concentrations would occur in a near-road location which meets microscale siting criteria in Appendix E of this part but is not a near-road NO2 monitoring site, then the EPA Regional Administrator may approve a request by a state to use such an alternate near-road location for a CO monitor in place of collocating a monitor at near-road NO2 monitoring site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Regional Administrators, in collaboration with states, may require additional CO monitors above the minimum number of monitors required in 4.2.1 of this part, where the minimum monitoring requirements are not sufficient to meet monitoring objectives. The Regional Administrator may require, at his/her discretion, additional monitors in situations where data or other information suggest that CO concentrations may be approaching or exceeding

the NAAQS. Such situations include, but are not limited to, (1) characterizing impacts on ground-level concentrations due to stationary CO sources, (2) characterizing CO concentrations in downtown areas or urban street canyons, and (3) characterizing CO concentrations in areas that are subject to high ground level CO concentrations particularly due to or enhanced by topographical and meteorological impacts. The Regional Administrator and the responsible State or local air monitoring agency shall work together to design and maintain the most appropriate CO network to address the data needs for an area, and include all monitors under this provision in the annual monitoring network plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> characterizing impacts on ground-level concentrations due to stationary CO sources, (2) characterizing CO concentrations in downtown areas or urban street canyons, and (3) characterizing CO concentrations in areas that are subject to high ground level CO concentrations particularly due to or enhanced by topographical and meteorological impacts. The Regional Administrator and the responsible State or local air monitoring agency shall work together to design and maintain the most appropriate CO network to address the data needs for an area, and include all monitors under this provision in the annual monitoring network plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Microscale and middle scale measurements are the most useful site classifications for CO monitoring sites since most people have the potential for exposure on these scales. Carbon monoxide maxima occur primarily in areas near major roadways and intersections with high traffic density and often in areas with poor atmospheric ventilation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Microscale--Microscale measurements typically represent areas in close proximity to major roadways, within street canyons, over sidewalks, and in some cases, point and area sources. Emissions on roadways result in high ground level CO concentrations at the microscale, where concentration gradients generally exhibit a marked decrease with increasing downwind distance from major roads, or within downtown areas including urban street canyons. Emissions from stationary point and area sources, and non-road sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high ground level concentrations at the microscale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Middle scale--Middle scale measurements are intended to represent areas with dimensions from 100 meters to 0.5 kilometer. In certain cases, middle scale measurements may apply to areas that have a total length of several kilometers, such as ``line'' emission source areas. This type of emission sources areas would include air quality along a commercially developed street or shopping plaza, freeway corridors, parking lots and feeder streets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Neighborhood scale--Neighborhood scale measurements are intended to represent areas with dimensions from 0.5 kilometers to 4 kilometers. Measurements of CO in this category would represent conditions throughout some reasonably urban sub-regions. In some cases, neighborhood scale data may represent not only the immediate neighborhood spatial area, but also other similar such areas across the larger urban area. Neighborhood scale measurements provide relative area-wide concentration data which are useful for providing relative urban background concentrations, supporting health and scientific research, and for use in modeling.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Design Criteria</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1 General Requirements</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> State and, where appropriate, local agencies must operate a minimum number of required NO2 monitoring sites as described below.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.2 Requirement for Near-road NO2 Monitors</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Within the NO2 network, there must be one microscale near-road NO2 monitoring station in each CBSA with a population of 500,000 or more persons to monitor a location of expected maximum hourly concentrations sited near a major road with high AADT counts as specified in paragraph 4.3.2(a)(1) of this appendix. An additional near-road NO2 monitoring station is required for any CBSA with a population of 2,500,000 persons or more, or in any CBSA with a population of 500,000 or more persons that has one or more roadway segments with 250,000 or greater AADT counts to monitor a second location of expected maximum hourly concentrations. CBSA populations shall be based on the latest available census figures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The near-road NO2 monitoring stations shall be selected by ranking all road segments within a CBSA by AADT and then identifying a location or locations adjacent to those highest ranked road segments, considering fleet mix, roadway design, congestion patterns, terrain, and meteorology, where maximum hourly NO2 concentrations are expected to occur and siting criteria can be met in accordance with appendix E of this part. Where a State or local air monitoring agency identifies multiple acceptable candidate sites where maximum hourly NO2 concentrations are expected to occur, the monitoring agency shall consider the potential for population exposure in the criteria utilized to select the final site location. Where one CBSA is required to have two near-road NO2 monitoring stations, the sites shall be differentiated from each other by one or more of the following factors: fleet mix; congestion patterns; terrain; geographic area within the CBSA; or different route, interstate, or freeway designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Measurements at required near-road NO2 monitor sites utilizing chemiluminescence FRMs must include at a minimum: NO, NO2, and NOX.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.3 Requirement for Area-wide NO2 Monitoring</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Within the NO2 network, there must be one monitoring station in each CBSA with a population of 1,000,000 or more persons to monitor a location of expected highest NO2 concentrations representing the neighborhood or larger spatial scales. PAMS sites collecting NO2 data that are situated in an area of expected high NO2 concentrations at the neighborhood or larger spatial scale may be

used to satisfy this minimum monitoring requirement when the NO2 monitor is operated year round. Emission inventories and meteorological analysis should be used to identify the appropriate locations within a CBSA for locating required area-wide NO2 monitoring stations. CBSA populations shall be based on the latest available census figures.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.4 Regional Administrator Required Monitoring</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Regional Administrators, in collaboration with States, must require a minimum of forty additional NO2 monitoring stations nationwide in any area, inside or outside of CBSAs, above the minimum monitoring requirements, with a primary focus on siting these monitors in locations to protect susceptible and vulnerable populations. The Regional Administrators, working with States, may also consider additional factors described in paragraph (b) below to require monitors beyond the minimum network requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Regional Administrators may require monitors to be sited inside or outside of CBSAs in which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The required near-road monitors do not represent all locations of expected maximum hourly NO2 concentrations in an area and NO2 concentrations may be approaching or exceeding the NAAQS in that area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Areas that are not required to have a monitor in accordance with the monitoring requirements and NO2 concentrations may be approaching or exceeding the NAAQS; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The minimum monitoring requirements for area-wide monitors are not sufficient to meet monitoring objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Regional Administrator and the responsible State or local air monitoring agency should work together to design and/or maintain the most appropriate NO2 network to address the data needs for an area, and include all monitors under this provision in the annual monitoring network plan.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.5 NO2 Monitoring Spatial Scales</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The most important spatial scale for near-road NO2 monitoring stations to effectively characterize the maximum expected hourly NO2 concentration due to mobile source emissions on major roadways is the microscale. The most important spatial scales for other monitoring stations characterizing maximum expected hourly NO2 concentrations are the microscale and middle scale. The most important spatial scale for area-wide monitoring of high NO2 concentrations is the neighborhood scale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Microscale--This scale represents areas in close proximity to major roadways or point and area sources. Emissions from roadways result in high ground level NO2 concentrations at the microscale, where concentration gradients generally exhibit a marked decrease with increasing downwind distance from major roads. As noted in appendix E of this part, near-road NO2 monitoring stations are required to be within 50 meters of target road segments in order to measure expected peak concentrations. Emissions from stationary point and area sources, and non-road sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high ground level concentrations at the microscale. The microscale typically represents an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Middle scale--This scale generally represents air quality levels in areas up to several city blocks in size with dimensions on the order of approximately 100 meters to 500 meters. The middle scale may include locations of expected maximum hourly concentrations due to proximity to major NO2 point, area, and/or non-road sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Neighborhood scale--The neighborhood scale represents air quality conditions throughout some relatively uniform land use areas with dimensions in the 0.5 to 4.0 kilometer range. Emissions from stationary point and area sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high NO2 concentrations at the neighborhood scale. Where a neighborhood site is located away from immediate NO2 sources, the site may be useful in representing typical air quality values for a larger residential area, and therefore suitable for population exposure and trends analyses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Urban scale--Measurements in this scale would be used to estimate concentrations over large portions of an urban area with dimensions from 4 to 50 kilometers. Such measurements would be useful for assessing trends in area-wide air quality, and hence, the effectiveness of large scale air pollution control strategies. Urban scale sites may also support other monitoring objectives of the NO2 monitoring network identified in paragraph 4.3.4 above.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.6 NOy Monitoring</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> NO/NOy measurements are included within the NCore multi-pollutant site requirements and the PAMS program. These NO/NOy measurements will produce conservative estimates for NO2 that can be used to ensure tracking continued compliance with the NO2 NAAQS. NO/NOy monitors are used at these sites because it is important to collect data on total reactive nitrogen species for understanding O3 photochemistry.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Design Criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> State and, where appropriate, local agencies must operate a minimum number of required SO2 monitoring sites as described below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The population weighted emissions index (PWEI) shall be calculated by States for each core based statistical area (CBSA) they contain or share with another State or States for use

in the implementation of or adjustment to the SO2 monitoring network. The PWEI shall be calculated by multiplying the population of each CBSA, using the most current census data or estimates, and the total amount of SO2 in tons per year emitted within the CBSA area, using an aggregate of the most recent county level emissions data available in the National Emissions Inventory for each county in each CBSA. The resulting product shall be divided by one million, providing a PWEI value, the units of which are million persons-tons per year. For any CBSA with a calculated PWEI value equal to or greater than 1,000,000, a minimum of three SO2 monitors are required within that CBSA. For any CBSA with a calculated PWEI value equal to or greater than 100,000, but less than 1,000,000, a minimum of two SO2 monitors are required within that CBSA. For any CBSA with a calculated PWEI value equal to or greater than 5,000, but less than 100,000, a minimum of one SO2 monitor is required within that CBSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The SO2 monitoring site(s) required as a result of the calculated PWEI in each CBSA shall satisfy minimum monitoring requirements if the monitor is sited within the boundaries of the parent CBSA and is one of the following site types (as defined in section 1.1.1 of this appendix): population exposure, highest concentration, source impacts, general background, or regional transport. SO2 monitors at NCore stations may satisfy minimum monitoring requirements if that monitor is located within a CBSA with minimally required monitors under this part.

The Regional Administrator may require, at his/her discretion, additional monitors in situations where an area has the potential to have concentrations that may violate or contribute to the violation of the NAAQS, in areas impacted by sources which are not conducive to modeling, or in locations with susceptible and vulnerable populations, which are not monitored under the minimum monitoring provisions described above.

Emissions from stationary point and area sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high SO2 concentrations at the neighborhood scale. Where a neighborhood site is located away from immediate SO2 sources, the site may be useful in representing typical air quality values for a larger residential area, and therefore suitable for population exposure and trends analyses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Urban scale--Measurements in this scale would be used to estimate concentrations over large portions of an urban area with dimensions from 4 to 50 kilometers. Such measurements would be useful for assessing trends in area-wide air quality, and hence, the effectiveness of large scale air pollution control strategies.

The most important spatial scale for non-source-oriented sites to characterize typical lead concentrations in urban areas is the neighborhood scale.

In the latter case, the microscale would represent an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters. Pb monitors in areas where the public has access, and particularly

The middle scale may for example, include schools and playgrounds in center city areas which are close to major Pb point sources. Pb monitors in such areas are desirable because of the higher sensitivity of children to exposures of elevated Pb concentrations (reference 3 of this appendix).

Emissions from stationary sources such as primary and secondary smelters, power plants, and other large industrial processes may, under certain plume conditions, likewise result in high ground level concentrations at the microscale. In the latter case, the microscale would represent an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters. Data collected at microscale sites provide information for evaluating and developing hot spot control measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Middle scale--Much of the short-term public exposure to coarse fraction particles (PM 10) is on this scale and on the neighborhood scale. People moving through downtown areas or living near major roadways or stationary sources, may encounter particulate pollution that would be adequately

characterized by measurements of this spatial scale. Middle scale PM 10 measurements can be appropriate for the evaluation of possible short-term exposure public health effects. In many situations, monitoring sites that are representative of micro-scale or middle-scale impacts are not unique and are representative of many similar situations. This can occur along traffic corridors or other locations in a residential district. In this case, one location is representative of a neighborhood of small scale sites and is appropriate for evaluation of long-term or chronic effects. This scale also includes the characteristic concentrations for other areas with dimensions of a few hundred meters such as the parking lot and feeder streets associated with shopping centers, stadia, and office buildings. In the case of PM 10, unpaved or seldomly swept parking lots associated with these sources could be an important source in addition to the vehicular emissions themselves.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Neighborhood scale--Measurements in this category represent conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-region with dimensions of a few kilometers and of generally more regular shape than the middle scale. Homogeneity refers to the particulate matter concentrations, as well as the land use and land surface characteristics. In some cases, a location carefully chosen to provide neighborhood scale data would represent not only the immediate neighborhood but also neighborhoods of the same type in other parts of the city. Neighborhood scale PM 10 sites provide information about trends and compliance with standards because they often represent conditions in areas where people commonly live and work for extended periods. Neighborhood scale data could provide valuable information for developing, testing, and revising models that describe the larger-scale concentration patterns, especially those models relying on spatially smoothed emission fields for inputs.

For purposes of establishing monitoring sites to represent large homogenous areas other than the above scales of representativeness and to characterize regional transport, urban or regional scale sites would also be needed. Most PM 2.5 monitoring in urban areas should be representative of a neighborhood scale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Micro-scale. This scale would typify areas such as downtown street canyons and traffic corridors where the general public would be exposed to maximum concentrations from mobile sources. In some circumstances, the micro-scale is appropriate for particulate sites. SLAMS sites measured at the micro-scale level should, however, be limited to urban sites that are representative of long-term human exposure and of many such microenvironments in the area. In general, micro-scale particulate matter

sites should be located near inhabited buildings or locations where the general public can be expected to be exposed to the concentration measured. Emissions from stationary sources such as primary and secondary smelters, power plants, and other large industrial processes may, under certain plume conditions, likewise result in high ground level concentrations at the micro-scale. In the latter case, the micro-scale would represent an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters. Data collected at micro-scale sites provide information for evaluating and developing hot spot control measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Middle scale--People moving through downtown areas, or living near major roadways, encounter particle concentrations that would be adequately characterized by this spatial scale. Thus, measurements of this type would be appropriate for the evaluation of possible short-term exposure public health effects of particulate matter pollution. In many situations, monitoring sites that are representative of microscale or middle-scale impacts are not unique and are representative of many similar situations. This can occur along traffic corridors or other locations in a residential district. In this case, one location is representative of a number of small scale sites and is appropriate for evaluation of long-term or chronic effects.

Much of the PM 2.5 exposures are expected to be associated with this scale of measurement. In some cases, a location carefully chosen to provide neighborhood scale data would represent the immediate neighborhood as well as neighborhoods of the same type in other parts of the city. PM 2.5 sites of this kind provide good information about trends and compliance with standards because they often represent conditions in areas where people commonly live and work for periods comparable to those specified in the NAAQS. In general, most PM 2.5 monitoring in urban areas should have this scale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Urban scale--This class of measurement would be used to characterize the particulate matter concentration over an entire metropolitan or rural area ranging in size from 4 to 50 kilometers. Such measurements would be useful for assessing trends in area-wide air quality, and hence, the effectiveness of large scale air pollution control strategies. Community-oriented PM 2.5 sites may have this scale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Regional scale--These measurements would characterize conditions over areas with dimensions of as much as hundreds of kilometers. As noted earlier, using representative conditions for an area implies some degree of homogeneity in that area. For this reason, regional scale measurements would be most applicable to sparsely populated areas. Data characteristics of this scale would provide information about larger scale processes of particulate matter emissions, losses and transport. PM 2.5 transport contributes to elevated particulate concentrations and may affect multiple urban and State entities with large populations such as in the eastern United States. Development of effective pollution control strategies requires an understanding at regional geographical scales of the emission sources and atmospheric processes that are responsible for elevated PM 2.5 levels and may also be associated with elevated O3 and regional haze.</p><p class="depth0">4.7.2 Requirement for Continuous PM 2.5 Monitoring. The State, or where appropriate, local agencies must operate continuous PM 2.5 analyzers equal to at least one-half (round up) the minimum required sites listed in Table D-5 of this appendix. At least one required continuous analyzer in each MSA must be collocated with one of the required FRM/FEM/ARM monitors, unless at least one of the required FRM/FEM/ARM monitors is itself a continuous FEM or ARM monitor in which case no collocation requirement applies. State and local air monitoring agencies must use methodologies and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures approved by the EPA Regional Administrator for these required continuous analyzers.</p><p class="depth0">4.7.3 Requirement for PM 2.5 Background and Transport Sites. Each State shall install and operate at least one PM 2.5 site to monitor for regional background and at least one PM 2.5 site to monitor regional transport. These monitoring sites may be at community-oriented sites and this requirement may be satisfied by a corresponding monitor in an area having similar air quality in another State. State and local air monitoring agencies must use methodologies and QA/QC procedures approved by the EPA Regional Administrator for these sites. Methods used at these sites may include non-federal reference method samplers such as IMPROVE or continuous PM 2.5 monitors.</p><p class="depth0">4.7.4 PM 2.5 Chemical Speciation Site Requirements. Each State shall continue to conduct chemical speciation monitoring and analyses at sites designated to be part of the PM 2.5 Speciation Trends Network (STN). The selection and modification of these STN

sites must be approved by the Administrator. The PM 2.5 chemical speciation urban trends sites shall include analysis for elements, selected anions and cations, and carbon. Samples must be collected using the monitoring methods and the sampling schedules approved by the Administrator. Chemical speciation is encouraged at additional sites where the chemically resolved data would be useful in developing State implementation plans and supporting atmospheric or health effects related studies.</p><p class="depth0">4.8 Coarse Particulate Matter (PM 10-2.5) Design Criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The only required monitors for PM 10-2.5 are those required at NCore Stations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Although microscale monitoring may be appropriate in some circumstances, middle and neighborhood scale measurements are the most important station classifications for PM 10-2.5 to assess the variation in coarse particle concentrations that would be expected across populated areas that are in proximity to large emissions sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Microscale--This scale would typify relatively small areas immediately adjacent to: Industrial sources; locations experiencing ongoing construction, redevelopment, and soil disturbance; and heavily traveled roadways.

Thus, measurements of this type would be appropriate for the evaluation of public health effects of coarse particle exposure. Monitors located in populated areas that are nearly adjacent to large industrial point sources of coarse particles provide suitable locations for assessing maximum population exposure levels and identifying areas of potentially poor air quality. Similarly, monitors located in populated areas that border dense networks of heavily-traveled traffic are appropriate for assessing the impacts of resuspended road dust. This scale also includes the characteristic concentrations for other areas with dimensions of a few hundred meters such as school grounds and parks that are nearly adjacent to major roadways and industrial point sources, locations exhibiting mixed residential and commercial development, and downtown areas featuring office buildings, shopping centers, and stadiums.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Neighborhood scale--Measurements in this category would represent conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-region with dimensions of a few kilometers and of generally more regular shape than the middle scale. Homogeneity refers to the particulate matter concentrations, as well as the land use and land surface characteristics. This category includes suburban neighborhoods dominated by residences that are somewhat distant from major roadways and industrial districts but still impacted by urban sources, and areas of diverse land use where residences are interspersed with commercial and industrial neighborhoods. In some cases, a location carefully chosen to provide neighborhood scale data would represent the immediate neighborhood as well as neighborhoods of the same type in other parts of the city. The comparison of data from middle scale and neighborhood scale sites would provide valuable information for determining the variation of PM 10-2.5 levels across urban areas and assessing the spatial extent of elevated concentrations caused by major industrial point sources and heavily traveled roadways. Neighborhood scale sites would provide concentration data that are relevant to informing a large segment of the population of their exposure levels on a given day.</p><p class="depth0">4.8.2 [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">5.

PAMS design criteria are site specific. Concurrent measurements of O3, oxides of nitrogen, speciated VOC, CO, and meteorology are obtained at PAMS sites. Design criteria for the PAMS network are based on locations relative to O3 precursor source areas and predominant wind directions associated with high O3 events. Specific monitoring objectives are associated with each location. The overall design should enable characterization of precursor emission sources within the area, transport of O3 and its precursors, and the photochemical processes related to O3 nonattainment. Specific objectives that must be addressed include assessing ambient trends in O3, oxides of nitrogen, VOC species, and determining spatial and diurnal variability of O3, oxides of nitrogen, and VOC species. Specific monitoring objectives associated with each of these sites may result in four distinct site types. Detailed guidance for the locating of these sites may be found in reference 9 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Type 1 sites are established to characterize upwind background and transported O3 and its precursor concentrations entering the area and will identify those areas which are subjected to transport.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Type 2 sites are established to monitor the magnitude and type of precursor emissions in the area where maximum precursor emissions are expected to impact and are suited for the monitoring of urban air toxic pollutants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Type 3 sites are intended to monitor maximum O3 concentrations occurring downwind from the area of maximum precursor emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Type 4 sites are established to characterize the downwind transported O3 and its precursor concentrations exiting the area and will identify those areas which are potentially contributing to overwhelming transport in other areas.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Monitoring Period.

Introduction</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This appendix contains specific location criteria applicable to SLAMS, NCore, and PAMS ambient air quality monitoring probes, inlets, and optical paths after the general location has been selected based on the monitoring objectives and spatial scale of representation discussed in appendix D to this part. Adherence to these siting criteria is necessary to ensure the uniform collection of compatible and comparable air quality data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The probe and monitoring path siting criteria discussed in this appendix must be followed to the maximum extent possible. It is recognized that there may be situations where some deviation from the siting criteria may be necessary. In any such case, the reasons must be thoroughly documented in a written request for a waiver that describes how and why the proposed siting deviates from the criteria. This documentation should help to avoid later questions about the validity of the resulting monitoring data. Conditions under which the EPA would consider an application for waiver from these siting criteria are discussed in section 10 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The pollutant-specific probe and monitoring path siting criteria generally apply to all spatial scales except where noted otherwise. Specific siting criteria that are phrased with a ``must'' are defined as requirements and exceptions must be approved through the waiver provisions. However, siting criteria that are phrased with a ``should'' are defined as goals to meet for consistency but are not requirements.</p><p class="depth0">2. Horizontal and Vertical Placement</p><p class="depth0">The probe or at least 80 percent of the monitoring path must be located between 2 and 15 meters above ground level for all O3 and SO2 monitoring sites, and for neighborhood or larger spatial scale Pb, PM 10, PM 10-2.5, PM 2.5, NO2, and CO sites. Middle scale PM 10-2.5 sites are required to have sampler inlets between 2 and 7 meters above ground level. Microscale Pb, PM 10, PM 10-2.5, and PM 2.5 sites are required to have sampler inlets between 2 and 7 meters above ground level. Microscale near-road NO2 monitoring sites are required to have sampler inlets between 2 and 7 meters above ground level. The inlet probes for microscale carbon monoxide monitors that are being used to measure concentrations near roadways must be between 2 and 7 meters above ground level. Those inlet probes for microscale carbon monoxide monitors measuring concentrations near roadways in downtown areas or urban street canyons must be between 2.5 and 3.5 meters above ground level. The probe or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must be at least 1 meter vertically or horizontally away from any supporting structure, walls, parapets, penthouses, etc., and away from dusty or dirty areas. If the probe or a significant portion of the monitoring path is located near the side of a building or

wall, then it should be located on the windward side of the building relative to the prevailing wind direction during the season of highest concentration potential for the pollutant being measured.</p><p class="depth0">3. Spacing From Minor Sources</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> It is important to understand the monitoring objective for a particular location in order to interpret this particular requirement. Local minor sources of a primary pollutant, such as SO2, lead, or particles, can cause high concentrations of that particular pollutant at a monitoring site. If the objective for that monitoring site is to investigate these local primary pollutant emissions, then the site is likely to be properly located nearby. This type of monitoring site would in all likelihood be a microscale type of monitoring site. If a monitoring site is to be used to determine air quality over a much larger area, such as a neighborhood or city, a monitoring agency should avoid placing a monitor probe, path, or inlet near local, minor sources. The plume from the local minor sources should not be allowed to inappropriately impact the air quality data collected at a site. Particulate matter sites should not be located in an unpaved area unless there is vegetative ground cover year round, so that the impact of wind blown dusts will be kept to a minimum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Similarly, local sources of nitric oxide (NO) and ozone-reactive hydrocarbons can have a scavenging effect causing unrepresentatively low concentrations of O3 in the vicinity of probes and monitoring paths for O3. To minimize these potential interferences, the probe or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must be away from furnace or incineration flues or other minor sources of SO2 or NO. The separation distance should take into account the heights of the flues, type of waste or fuel burned, and the sulfur content of the fuel.</p><p class="depth0">4. Spacing From Obstructions</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Buildings and other obstacles may possibly scavenge SO2, O3, or NO2, and can act to restrict airflow for any pollutant. To avoid this interference, the probe, inlet, or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must have unrestricted airflow and be located away from obstacles. The distance from the obstacle to the probe, inlet, or monitoring path must be at least twice the height that the obstacle protrudes above the probe, inlet, or monitoring path. An exception to this requirement can be made for measurements taken in street canyons or at source-oriented sites where buildings and other structures are unavoidable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Generally, a probe or monitoring path located near or along a vertical wall is undesirable because air moving along the wall may be subject to possible removal mechanisms. A probe, inlet, or monitoring path must have unrestricted airflow in an arc of at least 180 degrees. This arc must include the predominant wind direction for the season of greatest pollutant concentration potential. For particle sampling, a minimum of 2 meters of separation from walls, parapets, and structures is required for rooftop site placement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special consideration must be given to the use of open path analyzers due to their inherent potential sensitivity to certain types of interferences, or optical obstructions. A monitoring path must be clear of all trees, brush, buildings, plumes, dust, or other optical obstructions, including potential obstructions that may move due to wind, human activity, growth of vegetation, etc. Temporary optical obstructions, such as rain, particles, fog, or snow, should be considered when siting an open path analyzer. Any of these temporary obstructions that are of sufficient density to obscure the light beam will affect the ability of the open path analyzer to continuously measure pollutant concentrations. Transient, but significant obscuration of especially longer measurement paths could occur as a result of certain meteorological conditions (e.g., heavy fog, rain, snow) and/or aerosol levels that are of a sufficient density to prevent the open path analyzer's light transmission. If certain compensating measures are not otherwise implemented at the onset of monitoring (e.g., shorter path lengths, higher light source intensity), data recovery during periods of greatest primary pollutant potential could be compromised. For instance, if heavy fog or high particulate levels are coincident with periods of projected NAAQS-threatening pollutant potential, the representativeness of the resulting data record in reflecting maximum pollutant concentrations may be substantially impaired despite the fact that the site may otherwise exhibit an acceptable, even exceedingly high overall valid data capture rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For near-road NO2 monitoring stations, the monitor probe shall have an unobstructed air flow, where no obstacles exist at or above the height of the monitor probe, between the monitor probe and the outside nearest edge of the traffic lanes of the target road segment.</p><p class="depth0">5. Spacing From Trees</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Trees can provide surfaces for SO2, O3, or NO2 adsorption or reactions, and surfaces for particle deposition. Trees can also act as obstructions in cases where they are located between the air pollutant sources or source areas and the monitoring site, and where the trees are of a sufficient height and leaf canopy density to interfere with the normal airflow around the probe, inlet, or monitoring

path. To reduce this possible interference/obstruction, the probe, inlet, or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must be at least 10 meters or further from the drip line of trees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The scavenging effect of trees is greater for O3 than for other criteria pollutants. Monitoring agencies must take steps to consider the impact of trees on ozone monitoring sites and take steps to avoid this problem.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For microscale sites of any air pollutant, no trees or shrubs should be located between the probe and the source under investigation, such as a roadway or a stationary source.</p><p class="depth0">6.

Table E-1 of this appendix provides the required minimum separation distances between a roadway and a probe or, where applicable, at least 90 percent of a monitoring path for various ranges of daily roadway traffic. A sampling site having a point analyzer probe located closer to a roadway than allowed by the Table E-1 requirements should be classified as microscale or middle scale, rather than neighborhood or urban scale, since the measurements from such a site would more closely represent the middle scale. If an open path analyzer is used at a site, the monitoring path(s) must not cross over a roadway with an average daily traffic count of 10,000 vehicles per day or more. For those situations where a monitoring path crosses a roadway with fewer than 10,000 vehicles per day, monitoring agencies must consider the entire segment of the monitoring path in the area of potential atmospheric interference from automobile emissions. Therefore, this calculation must include the length of the monitoring path over the roadway plus any segments of the monitoring path that lie in the area between the roadway and minimum separation distance, as determined from the Table E-1 of this appendix. The sum of these distances must not be greater than 10 percent of the total monitoring path length.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Near-road microscale CO monitoring sites, including those located in downtown areas, urban street canyons, and other near-road locations such as those adjacent to highly trafficked roads, are intended to provide a measurement of the influence of the immediate source on the pollution exposure on the adjacent area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Microscale CO monitor inlets probes in downtown areas or urban street canyon locations shall be located a minimum distance of 2 meters and a maximum distance of 10 meters from the edge of the nearest traffic lane.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Microscale CO monitor inlet probes in downtown areas or urban street canyon locations shall be located at least 10 meters from an intersection and preferably at a midblock location. Midblock locations are preferable to intersection locations because intersections represent a much smaller portion of downtown space than do the streets between them. Pedestrian exposure is probably also greater in street canyon/corridors than at intersections.</p><p class="depth0">Table E-2 of Appendix E to Part 58--Minimum Separation Distance Between</p><p class="depth0">Roadways and Probes or Monitoring Paths for Monitoring Neighborhood</p><p class="depth0">Scale Carbon Monoxide------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Minimum</p><p class="depth0">Roadway average daily traffic, vehicles per day       distance \1\</p><p class="depth0"><em>(meters)</em>------------------------------------------------------------------------410,000.................................................              1015,000..................................................              2520,000..................................................              4530,000..................................................              8040,000..................................................             11550,000..................................................             135"60,000.................................................            150------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ Distance from the edge of the nearest traffic lane.

whether it be from mobile or multiple stationary sources. If the area is primarily affected by mobile sources and the maximum concentration area(s) is judged to be a traffic corridor or street canyon location, then the monitors should be located near roadways with the highest traffic volume and at separation distances most likely to produce the highest concentrations. For the microscale traffic corridor site, the location must be between 5 and 15 meters from the major roadway. For the microscale street canyon site the location must be between 2 and 10 meters from the roadway. For the middle scale site, a range of acceptable distances from the roadway is shown in figure E-1 of this appendix. This figure also includes separation distances between a roadway and neighborhood or larger scale sites by default. Any site, 2 to 15 meters high, and further back than the middle scale requirements will generally be neighborhood, urban or regional scale. For example, according to Figure E-1 of this appendix, if a PM sampler is primarily influenced by roadway emissions and that sampler is set back 10 meters from a 30,000 ADT (average daily traffic) road, the site should be classified as microscale, if the sampler height is between 2 and 7 meters. If the sampler height is between 7 and 15 meters, the site should be classified as middle scale. If the sample is 20 meters from the same road, it will be classified as middle scale; if 40 meters, neighborhood scale; and if 110 meters, an urban scale.</p><p class="depth0">6.4 Spacing for Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Probes and Monitoring Paths.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In siting near-road NO2 monitors as required in paragraph 4.3.2 of appendix D of this part, the monitor probe shall be as near as practicable to the outside nearest edge of the traffic lanes of the target road segment; but shall not be located at a distance greater than 50 meters, in the horizontal, from the outside nearest edge of the traffic lanes of the target road segment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In siting NO2 monitors for neighborhood and larger scale monitoring, it is important to minimize near-road influences. Table E-1 of this appendix provides the required minimum separation distances between a roadway and a probe or, where applicable, at least 90 percent of a monitoring path for various ranges of daily roadway traffic. A sampling site having a point analyzer probe located closer to a roadway than allowed by the Table E-1 requirements should be classified as microscale or middle scale rather than neighborhood or urban scale. If an open path analyzer is used at a site, the monitoring path(s) must not cross over a roadway with an average daily traffic count of 10,000 vehicles per day or more. For those situations where a monitoring path crosses a roadway with fewer than 10,000 vehicles per day, monitoring agencies must consider the entire segment of the monitoring path in the area of potential atmospheric interference form automobile emissions. Therefore, this calculation must include the length of the monitoring path over the roadway plus any segments of the monitoring path that lie in the area between the roadway and minimum separation distance, as determined form the Table E-1 of this appendix. The sum of these distances must not be greater than 10 percent of the total monitoring path length.

The cumulative length or portion of a monitoring path that is affected by minor sources, trees, or roadways must not exceed 10 percent of the total monitoring path length.</p><p class="depth0">8. Maximum Monitoring Path Length</p><p class="depth0">(This paragraph applies only to open path analyzers.) The monitoring path length must not exceed 1 kilometer for analyzers in neighborhood, urban, or regional scale. For middle scale monitoring sites, the monitoring path length must not exceed 300 meters. In areas subject to frequent periods of dust, fog, rain, or snow, consideration should be given to a shortened monitoring path length to minimize loss of monitoring data due to these temporary optical obstructions. For certain ambient air monitoring scenarios using open path analyzers, shorter path lengths may be needed in order to ensure that the monitoring site meets the objectives and spatial scales defined in appendix D to this part. The Regional Administrator may require shorter path lengths, as needed on an individual basis, to ensure that the SLAMS sites meet the appendix D requirements. Likewise, the Administrator may specify the maximum path length used at NCore monitoring sites.</p><p class="depth0">9. Probe Material and Pollutant Sample Residence Time</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For the reactive gases, SO2, NO2, and O3, special probe material must be used for point analyzers. Studies \20-24\ have been conducted to determine the suitability of materials such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, Tygon [supreg], aluminum, brass, stainless steel, copper, Pyrex [supreg] glass and Teflon [supreg] for use as intake sampling lines. Of the above materials, only Pyrex [supreg] glass and Teflon [supreg] have been found to be acceptable for use as intake sampling lines for all the reactive gaseous pollutants. Furthermore, the EPA \25\ has specified borosilicate glass or FEP Teflon [supreg] as the only acceptable probe materials for delivering test atmospheres in the determination of reference or equivalent methods. Therefore, borosilicate glass, FEP Teflon [supreg] or their equivalent must be the only material in the sampling train (from inlet probe to the back of the analyzer) that can be in contact with the ambient air sample for existing and new SLAMs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For volatile organic compound (VOC) monitoring at PAMS, FEP Teflon [supreg] is unacceptable as the probe material because of VOC adsorption and desorption reactions on the FEP Teflon [supreg]. Borosilicate glass, stainless steel, or its equivalent are the acceptable probe materials for VOC and carbonyl sampling. Care must be taken to ensure that the sample residence time is kept to 20 seconds or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No matter how nonreactive the sampling probe material is initially, after a period of use reactive particulate matter is deposited on the probe walls. Therefore, the time it takes the gas to transfer from the probe inlet to the sampling device is also critical. Ozone in the presence of nitrogen oxide (NO) will show significant losses even in the most inert probe material when the residence time exceeds 20 seconds. \26\ Other studies \27 28\ indicate that a 10 second or less residence time is easily achievable. Therefore, sampling probes for reactive gas monitors at NCore and at NO2 sites must have a sample residence time less than 20 seconds.</p><p class="depth0">10. Waiver Provisions</p><p class="depth0">Most sampling probes or monitors can be located so that they meet the requirements of this appendix. New sites with rare exceptions, can be located within the limits of this appendix. However, some existing sites may not meet these requirements and still produce useful data for some purposes. The EPA will consider a written request from the State agency to waive one or more siting criteria for some monitoring sites providing that the State can adequately demonstrate the need (purpose) for monitoring or establishing a monitoring site at that location.</p><p class="depth0">10.1 For establishing a new site, a waiver may be granted only if both of the following criteria are met:</p><p class="depth0">10.1.1 The site can be demonstrated to be as representative of the monitoring area as it would be if the siting criteria were being met.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.2 The monitor or probe cannot reasonably be located so as to meet the siting criteria because of physical constraints (e.g., inability to locate the required type of site the necessary distance from roadways or obstructions).</p><p class="depth0">10.2 However, for an existing site, a waiver may be granted if either of the criteria in sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 of this appendix are met.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Cost benefits, historical trends, and other factors may be used to add support to the criteria in sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 of this appendix, however, they in themselves, will not be acceptable reasons for granting a waiver. Written requests for waivers must be submitted to the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">11. Summary</p><p class="depth0">Table E-4 of this appendix presents a summary of the general requirements for probe and monitoring path siting criteria with respect to distances and heights. It is apparent from Table E-4 that different elevation distances above the ground are shown for the various pollutants. The discussion in this appendix for each of the pollutants describes reasons for elevating the monitor, probe, or monitoring path. The differences in the specified range of heights are based on the vertical concentration gradients. For CO and near-road NO2 monitors, the gradients in the vertical direction are very large for the microscale, so a small range of heights are used. The upper limit of 15 meters is specified for the consistency between pollutants and to allow the use of a single manifold or monitoring path for monitoring more than one pollutant.</p><p class="depth0">Table E-4 of Appendix E to Part 58--Summary of Probe and Monitoring Path Siting Criteria--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Horizontal and</p><p class="depth0">vertical distance</p><p class="depth0">Scale (maximum       Height from ground to     from supporting      Distance from trees       Distance from</p><p class="depth0">Pollutant                   monitoring path     probe, inlet or 80% of    structures \2\ to      to probe, inlet or     roadways to probe,</p><p class="depth0">length, meters)       monitoring path \1\    probe, inlet or 90%     90% of monitoring     inlet or monitoring</p><p class="depth0"><em>(meters)</em>           of monitoring path     path \1\ (meters)      path \1\ (meters)</p><p class="depth0">\1\ (meters)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SO2 \3 4 5 6\......................

What Additional Information Should I Know?</p><p class="depth0">General Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1. What Is the AQI?</p><p class="depth0">The AQI is a tool that simplifies reporting air quality to the general public. The AQI incorporates into a single index concentrations of 5 criteria pollutants: ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The scale of the index is divided into general categories that are associated with health messages.</p><p class="depth0">2. Why Report the AQI?</p><p class="depth0">The AQI offers various advantages:</p><p class="depth0">a. It is simple to create and understand.</p><p class="depth0">b. It conveys the health implications of air quality.</p><p class="depth0">c. It promotes uniform use throughout the country.</p><p class="depth0">3. Must I Report the AQI?</p><p class="depth0">You must report the AQI daily if yours is a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) with a population over 350,000.</p><p class="depth0">4. What Goes Into My AQI Report?</p><p class="depth0">i. Your AQI report must contain the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. The reporting area(s) (the MSA or subdivision of the MSA).</p><p class="depth0">b. The reporting period (the day for which the AQI is reported).</p><p class="depth0">c. The critical pollutant (the pollutant with the highest index value).</p><p class="depth0">d. The AQI (the highest index value).</p><p class="depth0">e. The category descriptor and index value associated with the AQI and, if you choose to report in a color format, the associated color. Use only the following descriptors and colors for the six AQI categories:</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--AQI Categories------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">And this color</p><p class="depth0">For this AQI             Use this descriptor        \1\------------------------------------------------------------------------0 to 50..........................  ``Good''............

The pollutant specific sensitive groups for any reported index value greater than 100. Use the following sensitive groups for each pollutant:

Children and people with</p><p class="depth0">respiratory disease are the</p><p class="depth0">groups most at risk.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">ii. When appropriate, your AQI report may also contain the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. Appropriate health and cautionary statements.</p><p class="depth0">b. The name and index value for other pollutants, particularly those with an index value greater than 100.</p><p class="depth0">c. The index values for sub-areas of your MSA.</p><p class="depth0">d. Causes for unusual AQI values.</p><p class="depth0">e. Actual pollutant concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">5. Is My AQI Report for My MSA Only?</p><p class="depth0">Generally, your AQI report applies to your MSA only. However, if a significant air quality problem exists (AQI greater than 100) in areas significantly impacted by your MSA but not in it (for example, O3 concentrations are often highest downwind and outside an urban area), you should identify these areas and report the AQI for these areas as well.</p><p class="depth0">6. How Do I Get My AQI Report to the Public?</p><p class="depth0">You must furnish the daily report to the appropriate news media (radio, television, and newspapers). You must make the daily report publicly available at one or more places of public access, or by any other means, including a recorded phone message, a public Internet site, or facsimile transmission. When the AQI value is greater than 100, it is particularly critical that the reporting to the various news media be as extensive as possible. At a minimum, it should include notification to the media with the largest market coverages for the area in question.</p><p class="depth0">7. How Often Must I Report the AQI?</p><p class="depth0">You must report the AQI at least 5 days per week. Exceptions to this requirement are in section 8 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">8. May I Make Exceptions to These Reporting Requirements?</p><p class="depth0">i. If the index value for a particular pollutant remains below 50 for a season or year, then you may exclude the pollutant from your calculation of the AQI in section 12.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If all index values remain below 50 for a year, then you may report the AQI at your discretion. In subsequent years, if pollutant levels rise to where the AQI would be above 50, then the AQI must be reported as required in sections 3, 4, 6, and 7 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Calculation</p><p class="depth0">9. How does the AQI relate to air pollution levels?</p><p class="depth0">For each pollutant, the AQI transforms ambient concentrations to a scale from 0 to 500. The AQI is keyed as appropriate to the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for each pollutant. In most cases, the index value of 100 is associated with the numerical level of the short-term standard (i.e., averaging time of 24-hours or less) for each pollutant. The index value of 50 is associated with the numerical level of the annual standard for a pollutant, if there is one, at one-half the level of the short-term standard for the pollutant, or at the level at which it is appropriate to begin to provide guidance on cautionary language. Higher categories of the index are based on increasingly serious health effects and increasing proportions of the population that are likely to be affected. The index is related to other air pollution concentrations through linear interpolation based on these levels. The AQI is equal to the highest of the numbers corresponding to each pollutant. For the purposes of reporting the AQI, the sub-indexes for PM 10 and PM 2.5 are to be considered separately. The pollutant responsible for the highest index value (the reported AQI) is called the ``critical'' pollutant.</p><p class="depth0">10. What monitors should I use to get the pollutant concentrations for</p><p class="depth0">calculating the AQI?</p><p class="depth0">You must use concentration data from State/Local Air Monitoring Station (SLAMS) or parts of the SLAMS required by 40 CFR 58.10 for each pollutant except PM. For PM, calculate and report the AQI on days for which you have measured air quality data (e.g., from continuous PM 2.5 monitors required in Appendix D to this part). You may use PM measurements from monitors that are not reference or equivalent methods (for example, continuous PM 10 or PM 2.5 monitors). Detailed guidance for relating non-approved measurements to approved methods by statistical linear regression is referenced in section 13 below.</p><p class="depth0">11. Do I Have to Forecast the AQI?</p><p class="depth0">You should forecast the AQI to provide timely air quality information to the public, but this is not required. If you choose to forecast the AQI, then you may consider both long-term and short-term forecasts. You can forecast the AQI at least 24-hours in advance using the most accurate and reasonable procedures considering meteorology, topography, availability of data, and forecasting expertise. The document ``Guideline for Developing an Ozone Forecasting Program'' (the Forecasting Guidance) will help you start a forecasting program. You can also issue short-term forecasts by predicting 8-hour ozone values from 1-hour ozone values using methods suggested in the Reporting Guidance, ``Guideline for Public Reporting of Daily Air Quality.''</p><p class="depth0">12. How do I calculate the AQI?</p><p class="depth0">i. The AQI is the highest value calculated for each pollutant as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Identify the highest concentration among all of the monitors within each reporting area and truncate as follows:
(1) Ozone--truncate to 3 decimal placesPM 2.5--truncate to 1 decimal placePM 10--truncate to integer

If the concentration is equal to a breakpoint, then the index is equal to the corresponding index value in Table 2. However, Equation 1 can still be used. The results will be equal. If the concentration is between two breakpoints, then calculate the index of that pollutant with Equation 1. You must also note that in some areas, the AQI based on 1-hour O3 will be more precautionary than using 8-hour values (see footnote 1 to Table 2). In these cases, you may use 1-hour values as well as 8-hour values to calculate index values and then use the maximum index value as the AQI for O3.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR08.001

Using Table 2 and Equation 1, calculate the index value for each of the pollutants measured and select the one that produces the highest index value for the AQI. For example, if you observe a PM 10 value of 210 g/m\3\, a 1-hour O3 value of 0.156 ppm, and an 8-hour O3 value of 0.130 ppm, then do this:</p><p class="depth0">a.

What additional information should I know?</p><p class="depth0">The EPA has developed a computer program to calculate the AQI for you. The program prompts for inputs, and it displays all the pertinent information for the AQI (the index value, color, category, sensitive group, health effects, and cautionary language). The EPA has also prepared a brochure on the AQI that explains the index in detail (The Air Quality Index), Reporting Guidance (Technical Assistance Document for the Reporting of Daily Air Quality--the Air Quality Index (AQI)) that provides associated health effects and cautionary statements, and Forecasting Guidance (Guideline for Developing an Ozone Forecasting Program) that explains the steps necessary to start an air pollution forecasting program.
