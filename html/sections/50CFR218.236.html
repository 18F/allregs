Each quarterly mission report will include all active- mode missions completed during that quarter. At a minimum, each  classified mission report must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dates, times, and location of each vessel during each mission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information on sonar transmissions during each mission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Results of the marine mammal monitoring program specified in the  Letter of Authorization; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Estimates of the percentages of marine mammal species and stocks  affected (both for the quarter and cumulatively for the year) covered by  the Letter of Authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Holder of a Letter of Authorization must submit an  unclassified annual report to the Director, Office of Protected  Resources, NMFS, no later than 45 days after the expiration of a Letter  of Authorization. The reports must contain all the information required  by the Letter of Authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A final comprehensive report must be submitted to the Director,  Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, at least 240 days prior to  expiration of these regulations. In addition to containing all the  information required by any final year Letter of Authorization, this  report must contain an unclassified analysis of new passive sonar  technologies and an assessment of whether such a system is feasible as  an alternative to SURTASS LFA sonar.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Navy will continue to assess the data collected by its  undersea arrays and work toward making some portion of that data, after  appropriate security reviews, available to scientists with appropriate  clearances. Any portions of the analyses conducted by these scientists  based on these data that are determined to be unclassified after  appropriate security reviews will be made publically available. The Navy  will provide a status update to NMFS when they submit their annual  application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Following the Scientific Advisory Group's (SAG) submission of  findings, and assuming the SAG recommends going forward with beaked  whale and/or harbor porpoise monitoring/research, the Navy will either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Draft a plan of action outlining their strategy for implementing  the SAG's recommendations; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe in writing why none of the SAG's recommendations are  feasible and meet with NMFS to discuss any other potential options.</p>
