                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the definitions contained in the Act and Sec. 216.3 of this chapter, and unless otherwise defined in this chapter, the terms in this chapter have the following meaning:</p><p class="depth0">Act or MMPA means the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.).</p><p class="depth0">American lobster or lobster means Homarus americanus.</p><p class="depth0">Anchored gillnet means any gillnet gear, including an anchored float gillnet, sink gillnet or stab net, that is set anywhere in the water column and which is anchored, secured, or weighted to the bottom of the sea. Also called a set gillnet.</p><p class="depth0">Assistant Administrator means the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p class="depth0">Authorization Certificate means a document issued by the Assistant Administrator, or designee, under the authority of section 118 of the Act that authorizes the incidental, but not intentional, taking of marine mammals in Category I or II fisheries.</p><p class="depth0">Bitter end means the end of a line that detaches from a weak link.</p><p class="depth0">Bottom portion of the line means, for buoy lines, the portion of the line in the water column that is closest to the fishing gear.</p><p class="depth0">Breaking strength means the highest tensile force which an object can withstand before breaking.</p><p class="depth0">Bridle means the lines connecting a gillnet to an anchor or buoy line.</p><p class="depth0">Buoy line means a line connecting fishing gear in the water to a buoy at the surface of the water.</p><p class="depth0">Category I fishery means a commercial fishery determined by the Assistant Administrator to have frequent incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals. A commercial fishery that frequently causes mortality or serious injury of marine mammals is one that is by itself responsible for the annual removal of 50 percent or

more of any stock's potential biological removal level.</p><p class="depth0">Category II fishery means a commercial fishery determined by the Assistant Administrator to have occasional incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals. A commercial fishery that occasionally causes mortality or serious injury of marine mammals is one that, collectively with other fisheries, is responsible for the annual removal of more than 10 percent of any marine mammal stock's potential biological removal level and that is by itself responsible for the annual removal of between 1 and 50 percent, exclusive, of any stock's potential biological removal level. In the absence of reliable information indicating the frequency of incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals by a commercial fishery, the Assistant Administrator will determine whether the incidental serious injury or mortality is ``occasional'' by evaluating other factors such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and areas fished, qualitative data from logbooks or fisher reports, stranding data, and the species and distribution of marine mammals in the area, or at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator. Eligible commercial fisheries not specifically identified in the list of fisheries are deemed to be Category II fisheries until the next list of fisheries is published.</p><p class="depth0">Category III fishery means a commercial fishery determined by the Assistant Administrator to have a remote likelihood of, or no known incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals. A commercial fishery that has a remote likelihood of causing incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals is one that collectively with other fisheries is responsible for the annual removal of:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Ten percent or less of any marine mammal stock's potential biological removal level, or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> More than 10 percent of any marine mammal stock's potential biological removal level, yet that fishery by itself is responsible for the annual removal of 1 percent or less of that stock's potential biological removal level. In the absence of reliable information indicating the frequency of incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals by a commercial fishery, the Assistant Administrator will determine whether the incidental serious injury or mortality is ``remote'' by evaluating other factors such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and areas fished, qualitative data from logbooks or fisher reports, stranding data, and the species and distribution of marine mammals in the area or at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">Commercial fishing operation means the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish from the marine environment (or other areas where marine mammals occur) that results in the sale or barter of all or part of the fish harvested. The term includes licensed commercial passenger fishing vessel (as defined in Sec. 216.3 of this chapter) activities and aquaculture activities.</p><p class="depth0">Depleted species means any species or population that has been designated as depleted under the Act and is listed in Sec. 216.15 of this chapter or part 18, subpart E of this title, or any endangered or threatened species of marine mammal.</p><p class="depth0">Driftnet, drift gillnet, or drift entanglement gear means a gillnet or gillnets that is/are unattached to the ocean bottom and not anchored, secured or weighted to the bottom, regardless of whether attached to a vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Fisher or fisherman means the vessel owner or operator, or the owner or operator of gear in a nonvessel fishery.</p><p class="depth0">Fishery has the same meaning as in section 3 of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802).</p><p class="depth0">Fishing or to fish means any commercial fishing operation activity that involves:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The attempted catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Any other activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Any operations at sea in support of, or in preparation for, any activity

described in paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) of this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Fishing trip means any time spent away from port actively engaged in commercial fishing operations. The end of a fishing trip will be the time of a fishing vessel's return to port or the return of a fisher from tending gear in a nonvessel fishery.</p><p class="depth0">Fishing vessel or vessel means any vessel, boat, ship, or other craft that is used for, equipped to be used for, or of a type normally used for, fishing.</p><p class="depth0">Float-line means the rope at the top of a gillnet from which the mesh portion of the net is hung.</p><p class="depth0">Gillnet means fishing gear consisting of a wall of webbing (meshes) or nets, designed or configured so that the webbing (meshes) or nets are placed in the water column, usually held approximately vertically, and are designed to capture fish by entanglement, gilling, or wedging. The term ``gillnet'' includes gillnets of all types, including but not limited to sink gillnets, other anchored gillnets (e.g., anchored float gillnets, stab, and set nets), and drift gillnets. Gillnets may or may not be attached to a vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Groundline, with reference to trap/pot gear, means a line connecting traps in a trap trawl, and, with reference to gillnet gear, means a line connecting a gillnet or gillnet bridle to an anchor.</p><p class="depth0">Hard lay lines mean lines that are at least as stiff as \5/16\ inch (0.8 cm) diameter line composed of polyester wrapped around a blend of polypropylene and polyethylene and 42 visible twists of strands per foot of line.</p><p class="depth0">Incidental means, with respect to an act, a non-intentional or accidental act that results from, but is not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful action.</p><p class="depth0">Injury means a wound or other physical harm. Signs of injury to a marine mammal include, but are not limited to, visible blood flow, loss of or damage to an appendage or jaw, inability to use one or more appendages, asymmetry in the shape of the body or body position, noticeable swelling or hemorrhage, laceration, puncture or rupture of eyeball, listless appearance or inability to defend itself, inability to swim or dive upon release from fishing gear, or signs of equilibrium imbalance. Any animal that ingests fishing gear, or any animal that is released with fishing gear entangling, trailing or perforating any part of the body will be considered injured regardless of the absence of any wound or other evidence of an injury.</p><p class="depth0">Insignificance threshold means the upper limit of annual incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammal stocks by commercial fisheries that can be considered insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate. An insignificance threshold is estimated as 10 percent of the Potential Biological Removal level for a stock of marine mammals. If certain parameters (e.g., maximum net productivity rate or the recovery factor in the calculation of the stock's potential biological removal level) can be estimated or otherwise modified from default values, the Assistant Administrator may use a modification of the number calculated from the simple formula for the insignificance threshold. The Assistant Administrator may also use a modification of the simple formula when information is insufficient to estimate the level of mortality and serious injury that would have an insignificant effect on the affected population stock and provide a rationale for using the modification.</p><p class="depth0">Interaction means coming in contact with fishing gear or catch. An interaction may be characterized by a marine mammal entangled, hooked, or otherwise trapped in fishing gear, regardless of whether injury or mortality occurs, or situations where marine mammals are preying on catch. Catch means fish or shellfish that has been hooked, entangled, snagged, trapped or otherwise captured by commercial fishing gear.</p><p class="depth0">Large mesh gillnet means a gillnet constructed with a mesh size of 7 inches (17.78 cm) to 18 inches (45.72 cm).</p><p class="depth0">Lead-line means the rope, weighted or otherwise, to which the bottom edge of a gillnet is attached.</p><p class="depth0">List of Fisheries means the most recent final list of commercial fisheries published in the Federal Register by the Assistant Administrator, categorized according to the likelihood of incidental mortality and serious injury
