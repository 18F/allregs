                            <p class="depth0">At the time the PHA approves a tenancy for initial occupancy of a  dwelling unit by a family with tenant-based assistance under the  program, and where the gross rent of the unit exceeds the applicable  payment standard for the family, the family share must not exceed 40  percent of the family's   adjusted monthly income. The determination of adjusted monthly income  must be based on verification information received by the PHA no earlier  than 60 days before the PHA issues a voucher to the family.
