                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. By going to Operator X's ticket office or calling X for a  reservation, a passenger can buy or reserve a ticket from Point A  through to Point C, transferring at intermediate Point B to a bus  operated by Operator Y. Operator X is responsible for communicating  immediately with Operator Y to ensure that Y knows that a passenger  needing accessible transportation or equivalent service, as applicable,  is traveling from Point B to Point C. By immediate communication, we  mean that the ticket or reservation agent for Operator X, by phone, fax,  computer, or other instantaneous means, contacts Operator Y the minute  the reservation or ticketing transaction with the passenger, as  applicable, has been completed. It is the responsibility of each carrier  to know how to contact carriers with which it interlines (e.g., Operator  X must know Operator Y's phone number).</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Operator X fails to provide the required information in a  timely manner to Operator Y. Operator X is responsible for compensating  the passenger for the consequent unavailability of an accessible bus or  equivalent service, as applicable, on the B-C leg of the interline trip.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. In Example 1 to paragraph (a) of this section, Operator X  provides the required information to Operator Y in a timely fashion.  However, Operator Y fails to provide an accessible bus or equivalent  service to the passenger at Point B as the rules require. Operator Y is  responsible for compensating the passenger as provided in Sec. 37.199.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Operator X provides the required information to Operator  Y in a timely fashion. However, the rules require Operator Y to provide  an accessible bus on 48 hours' advance notice (i.e., as a matter of  interim service under Sec. 37.193(a) or service by a small mixed- service operator under Sec. 37.191), and the passenger has purchased  the ticket or made the reservation for the interline trip only 8 hours  before Operator Y's bus leaves from Point B to go to Point C. In this  situation, Operator Y is not responsible for providing an accessible bus  to the passenger at Point B, any more than that it would be had the  passenger directly contacted Operator Y to travel from Point B to Point  C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Operator Y's office is staffed only during normal weekday  business hours. Operator Y must have a means of receiving communications  from carriers with which it   interlines (e.g., telephone answering machine, fax, computer) when no  one is in the office.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Operator Y has the responsibility to monitor its  communications devices at reasonable intervals to ensure that it can act  promptly on the basis of messages received. If Operator Y receives a  message from Operator X on its answering machine on Friday night,  notifying Y of the need for an accessible bus on Monday morning, it has  the responsibility of making sure that the accessible bus is there on  Monday morning. Operator Y is not excused from its obligation because no  one checked the answering machine over the weekend.</p>
