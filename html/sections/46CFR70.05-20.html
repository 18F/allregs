                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The regulations in this subchapter, as well as referenced  requirements in other subchapters in this chapter, take into account the  passenger vessel's size, construction, and equipment, as well as its  intended service on the routes or waters on which it is desired to be  operated or navigated, which are indications of the hazards to which  such vessel may be subjected. The Commandant's determinations in this  respect for a particular passenger vessel are stipulated in a  certificate of inspection, which states certain terms and conditions  governing such vessel when in operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In applying the laws and regulations to passenger vessels, one  criterion for invocation of safety standards is the description of  passenger vessels by relative size in gross tons. When it is determined  by the Commandant that the gross register tonnage for a particular  passenger vessel, which is attained by exemptions, reductions, or other  devices in the basic gross tonnage formulation, will circumvent or be  incompatible with the application of specific safety requirements in the  passenger vessel regulations for a vessel of such physical size, the  Commandant shall prescribe the regulations to be made applicable to such  vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the Commandant determines that the gross register tonnage  is not a valid criterion for the invocation of safety requirements based  on relative size, the parties involved will be informed of the  determination and of the regulations applicable to such passenger  vessel, and before being permitted to operate such vessel, compliance  therewith shall be required. Endorsements or notations on the passenger  vessel's certificate of inspection may be made as appropriate.</p>
