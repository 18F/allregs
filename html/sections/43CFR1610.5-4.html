Such  maintenance is limited to further refining or documenting a previously  approved decision incorporated in the plan. Maintenance shall not result  in expansion in the scope of resource uses or restrictions, or change  the terms, conditions, and decisions of the approved plan. Maintenance  is not considered a plan amendment and shall not require the formal   public involvement and interagency coordination process described under  Sec. Sec. 1610.2 and 1610.3 of this title or the preparation of an  environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. Maintenance  shall be documented in plans and supporting records.</p>
