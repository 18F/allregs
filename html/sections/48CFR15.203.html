See subpart  7.3 for additional information regarding cost comparisons between  Government and contractor performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Electronic commerce may be used to issue RFPs and to receive  proposals, modifications, and revisions. In this case, the RFP shall  specify the electronic commerce method(s) that offerors may use (see  subpart 4.5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contracting officers may issue RFPs and/or authorize receipt of  proposals, modifications, or revisions by facsimile.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In deciding whether or not to use facsimiles, the contracting  officer should consider factors such as--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Anticipated proposal size and volume;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Urgency of the requirement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Availability and suitability of electronic commerce methods;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Adequacy of administrative procedures and controls for  receiving, identifying, recording, and safeguarding facsimile proposals,  and ensuring their timely delivery to the designated proposal delivery  location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If facsimile proposals are authorized, contracting officers may  request offeror(s) to provide the complete, original signed proposal at  a later date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Letter RFPs may be used in sole source acquisitions and other  appropriate circumstances.
