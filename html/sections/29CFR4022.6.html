                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this section, an annuity which is payable (or would be payable after a waiting period described in the plan, whether or not the participant is in receipt of other benefits during such waiting period), under the terms of a plan on account of the total and permanent disability of a participant which is expected to last for the life of the participant and which began on or before the termination date is considered to be a pension benefit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In any case in which the PBGC determines that the standards for determining such total and permanent disability under a plan were unreasonable, or were modified in anticipation of termination of the plan, the disability benefits payable to a participant under such standard shall not be guaranteed unless the participant meets the standards of the Social Security Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder for determining total disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purpose of this section, a participant may be required, upon the request of the PBGC, to submit to an examination or to submit proof of continued total and permanent disability. If the PBGC finds that a participant is no longer so disabled, it may suspend, modify, or discontinue the payment of the disability benefit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination. In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, ``bankruptcy filing date'' is substituted for ``termination date'' in paragraph (a) of this section.
