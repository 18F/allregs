                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, only the MAP Lender Review Board may terminate a lender's MAP privileges, in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 200.1535.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Administrative termination. HUD will notify a lender of immediate termination of MAP privileges when either of the following circumstances is present:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Failure by the MAP lender to maintain its status as an FHA-approved lender; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure by the MAP lender to maintain a minimum level of MAP lender activity, as evidenced by failure to submit either a pre-application package or firm commitment application at least once every 12 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of termination. (1) The terminated lender shall be removed from the MAP-Approved Lender list on HUD's Web site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The terminated lender shall be removed from the MAP-Approved Lender list on HUD's Web site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A terminated lender may not submit, and the HUD field office may not accept, materials after the close of business of the date of the termination letter for new multifamily mortgage insurance from HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any MAP pre-application or MAP application in process may no longer be processed under MAP by the terminated lender. The lender will either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Immediately transfer the transaction to the traditional application processing (TAP) procedure. HUD will completely reprocess all stages of the transaction; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Immediately transfer the project to a new MAP lender. The new MAP lender must completely reprocess all stages of the transaction. At no time can the new MAP lender assign the pre-application, the firm application, the mortgage insurance commitment, or the insured construction loan back to the original MAP lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> HUD will not endorse any MAP loan processed by the terminated lender unless a firm commitment was issued before the date of termination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Firm commitments involving new construction or substantial rehabilitation must be immediately transferred to a new MAP lender. At no time can the new MAP lender assign the firm mortgage insurance commitment, or the insured construction loan, back to the original MAP lender.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Firm commitments issued for Section 223(f) projects may be transferred before final endorsement to any

approved FHA lender or kept in the lender's portfolio.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For those construction loans that have been initially endorsed, the MAP lender will lose its MAP privileges for construction loan administration. HUD will assume all the construction loan administration duties it normally performs for TAP processing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The original lender may service a transferred loan once it is finally endorsed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Termination is nationwide in effect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When a MAP lender loses its MAP lender status as a result of termination, the lender's status to process transactions using TAP is unaffected, provided that the lender has maintained its status as an FHA-approved multifamily lender.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reinstatement. An application for reinstatement of MAP authority may not be made until at least 12 months after the date of termination. The requirements for reinstatement shall be the same as for initial qualification, and the applicant must show that the problems that led to termination have been resolved.</p>
