Specifically, in areas of operations which require enhanced  coordination of PSC and PSC personnel working for U.S. Government  (U.S.G.) agencies, the Secretary of Defense may designate such areas as  areas of combat operations or other significant military operations for  the limited purposes of this part. In such an instance, the standards  established in accordance with this part would, in coordination with the  Secretary of State, expand from covering only DoD PSCs and PSC personnel  to cover all U.S.G.-funded PSCs and PSC personnel operating in the  designated area. The requirements of this part shall not apply to a  nonprofit nongovernmental organization receiving grants or cooperative  agreements for activities conducted within an area of other significant  military operations if the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of  State agree that such organization may be exempted. An exemption may be  granted by the agreement of the Secretaries under this paragraph on an  organization-by-organization or area-by-area basis. Such an exemption  may not be granted with respect to an area of combat operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prescribes policies applicable to all:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DoD PSCs and PSC personnel performing private security functions  during contingency operations outside the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> USG-funded PSCs and PSC personnel performing private security  functions in an area of combat operations or, with the agreement of the  Secretary of State, other significant military operations as designated  by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
