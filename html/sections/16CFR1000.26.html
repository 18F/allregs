                            <p class="depth0">The Directorate for Epidemiology, managed by the Associate Executive Director for Epidemiology, is responsible for the collection and analysis of data on injuries and deaths associated with consumer products. The Directorate has two divisions: the Data Systems Division and the Hazard Analysis Division. The Data Systems Division operates the national data collection systems which provide the data that serve as the basis for the Commission's estimates of the numbers of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products. These data systems include the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, a nationally representative sample of hospital emergency departments; a death certificate file, which contains data obtained from death certificates on deaths associated with consumer products; and the Injury and Potential Injury Incident file, which contains information on, among other things, incidents associated with consumer products, based on news clips, medical examiner reports, hotline reports, Internet complaints, and referrals. The Hazard Analysis Division conducts statistical analysis of these data and conducts epidemiologic studies to estimate the numbers of injuries and deaths associated with various consumer products and to examine factors associated with these injuries and deaths. In addition, staff in the Hazard Analysis Division design special studies, design and analyze data from experiments for testing of consumer products, and provide statistical expertise and advice to Commission staff in support of regulation development.</p>
