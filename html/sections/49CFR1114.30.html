                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. Any party may serve on any other party a request:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To produce and permit the party making the request to inspect  any designated documents (including writings, drawings, graphs, charts,  photographs, phonograph records, tapes, and other data compilations from  which information can be obtained, translated, if necessary, with or  without the use of detection devices into reasonably usable form), or to  inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things which are in the  possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is  served, but if the writings or data compilations include privileged or  proprietary information or information the disclosure of which is  proscribed by the Act, such writings or data compilations need not be  produced under this rule but may be provided pursuant to Sec.   1114.26(b) of this part; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To permit, subject to appropriate liability releases and safety  and operating considerations, entry upon designated land or other  property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the request  is served for the purpose of inspecting and measuring, surveying,  photographing, testing, or sampling the property or any designated  object or operation thereon.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure. Any request filed pursuant to this rule should set  forth the items to be inspected either by individual item or by category  and describe each item and category with reasonable particularity. The  request should specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making  the inspection and performing the related acts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitation under simplified standards. In a case using the  Three-Benchmark methodology, each party is limited to ten document  requests (including subparts) absent advance authorization from the  Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agreements containing interchange commitments. In any proceeding  involving the reasonableness of provisions related to an existing rail  carrier sale or lease agreement that serve to induce a party to the  agreement to interchange traffic with another party to the agreement,  rather than with a third-party connecting carrier, whether by outright  prohibition, per-car penalty, adjustment in the purchase price or  rental, positive economic inducement, or other means, a party to the  proceeding with a need for the information may obtain a confidential,  complete version   of the agreement, with the prior approval of the Board. The party  seeking such approval must file an appropriate motion containing an  explanation of the party's need for the information and a draft  protective order and undertaking(s) that will ensure the agreement is  kept confidential. The motion seeking approval may be filed at any time  after the initial complaint or petition, including before the answer to  the complaint or petition is due. A reply to such a motion must be filed  within 5 days thereafter. The motion will be considered by the Board in  an expedited manner.
