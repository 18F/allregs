                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 50.47 of NRC's Emergency Planning Rule (10 CFR parts 50 (appendix E) and 70 as amended) and the joint FEMA-NRC Criteria for Preparation and Evaluation of Radiological Emergency Response Plans and Preparedness in Support of Nuclear Power Plants (NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1, November 1980) which apply insofar as FEMA is concerned to State and local governments, are to be used in reviewing, evaluating and approving State and local radiological emergency plans and preparedness and in making any findings and determinations with respect to the adequacy of the plans and the capabilities of State and local governments to implement them. Both the planning and preparedness standards and related criteria contained in NUREG-0654/ FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1 are to be used by FEMA and the NRC in reviewing and evaluating State and local government radiological emergency plans and preparedness. For brevity, only the planning standards contained in NUREG-0654/ FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1 are presented below.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Primary responsibilities for emergency response by the nuclear facility licensee, and by State and local organizations within the Emergency Planning Zones have been assigned, the emergency responsibilities of the various supporting organizations have been specifically established and each principal response organization has staff to respond to and augment its initial response on a continuous basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On-shift facility licensee responsibilities for emergency response are

unambiguously defined, adequate staffing to provide initial facility accident response in key functional areas is maintained at all times, timely augmentation of response capabilities is available and the interfaces among various onsite response activities and offsite support and response activities are specified. (This standard applies only to NRC licensees but is included here for completeness.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Arrangements for requesting and effectively using assistance resources have been made, arrangements to accommodate State and local staff at the licensee's near-site Emergency Operations Facility have been made and other organizations capable of augmenting the planned response have been identified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A standard emergency classification and action level scheme, the bases of which include facility system and effluent parameters, is in use by the nuclear facility licensee, and State and local response plans call for reliance on information provided by facility licensees for determinations of minimum initial offsite response measures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Procedures have been established for notification, by the licensee, of State and local response organizations and for the notification of emergency personnel by all response organizations; the content of initial and followup messages to response organizations and the public has been established; and means to provide early notification and clear instruction to the populace within the plume exposure pathway Emergency Planning Zone have been established.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Provisions exist for prompt communications among principal response organizations to emergency personnel and to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Information is made available to the public on a periodic basis on how they will be notified and what their initial actions should be in an emergency (e.g., listening to a local broadcast station and remaining indoors), the principal points of contact with the news media for dissemination of information during an emergency (including the physical location or locations) are established in advance and procedures for coordinated dissemination of information to the public are established.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Adequate emergency facilities and equipment to support the emergency response are provided and maintained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Adequate methods, systems and equipment for assessing and monitoring actual or potential offsite consequences of a radiological emergency condition are in use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A range of protective actions has been developed for the plume exposure pathway EPZ for emergency workers and the public. Guidelines for the choice of protective actions during an emergency, consistent with Federal guidance, are developed and in place and protective actions for the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ appropriate to the locale have been developed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Means for controlling radiological exposures, in an emergency, are established for emergency workers. The means for controlling radiological exposures shall include exposure guidelines consistent with EPA Emergency Worker and Lifesaving Activity Protective Action Guides.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Arrangements are made for medical services for contaminated injured individuals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> General plans for recovery and reentry are developed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Periodic exercises are (will be) conducted to evaluate major portions of emergency response capabilities, periodic drills are (will be) conducted to develop and maintain key skills and deficiencies identified as a result of exercises or drills are (will be) corrected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Radiological emergency response training is provided to those who may be called upon to assist in an emergency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Responsibilities for plan development and review and for distribution of emergency plans are established, and planners are properly trained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In order for State of local plans and preparedness to be approved, such plans and preparedness must be determined to adequately protect the public health and safety by providing reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken offsite in the event of a radiological emergency.</p>
