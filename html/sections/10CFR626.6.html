                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. For the direct purchase of crude oil, DOE shall,  through certified contracting officers, conduct crude oil acquisitions  in accordance with the FAR and the DEAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acquisition strategy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DOE solicitations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> May be either continuously open or fixed for a period of time  (usually no longer than 6 months); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> May provide either for prompt delivery or for delivery at  future dates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DOE may alter the acquisition plan to take advantage of  differentials in prices for different qualities of oil, based on a  consideration of the availability of storage capacity in the SPR sites,  the logistics of changing delivery streams, and the availability of  ships, pipelines and terminals to move and receive the oil.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Based on the market analysis described in paragraph (d) of this  section, DOE may refuse offers or suspend the acquisition process on the  basis of Government estimates that project substantially lower oil  prices in the future than those contained in offers. If DOE determines  there is a high probability that the cost to the Government can be  reduced without significantly affecting national energy security goals,  DOE may either contract for delivery at a future date or delay purchases  to take advantage of projected future lower prices. Conversely, DOE may  increase the rate of purchases if prices fall below recent price trends  or futures markets present a significant contango and prices offer the  opportunity to reduce the average cost of oil acquisitions in  anticipation of higher prices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Based on the market analysis described in paragraph (d) of this  section, DOE may refuse offers, decrease the   rate of purchase, or suspend the acquisition process if DOE determines  acquisition will add significant upward pressure to prices either  regionally or on a world-wide basis. DOE may consider recent price  changes, private inventory levels, oil acquisition by other stockpiling  entities, the outlook for world oil production, incipient disruptions of  supply or refining capability, logistical problems for moving petroleum  products, macroeconomic factors, and any other considerations that may  be pertinent to the balance of petroleum supply and demand.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fill requirements determination. DOE shall develop SPR fill  requirements for each solicitation based on an assessment of national  energy security goals, the availability of storage capacity, and the  need for specific grades and quantities of crude oil.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Market analysis. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DOE shall establish a market value for each  crude type to be acquired based on a market analysis at the time of  contract award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In conducting the market analysis, DOE may use prices on futures  markets, spot markets, recent price movements, current and projected  shipping rates, forecasts by the DOE Energy Information Administration,  and any other analytic tools available to DOE to determine the most  desirable purchase profile.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A market analysis may also consider recent price changes,  private inventory levels, oil acquisition by other stockpiling entities,  the outlook for world oil production, incipient disruptions of supply or  refining capability, logistical problems for moving petroleum products,  macroeconomic factors, and any other considerations that may be  pertinent to the balance of petroleum supply and demand.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Evaluation of offers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DOE shall evaluate offers using:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The criteria and requirements stated in the solicitation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The market analysis under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DOE shall require financial guarantees from contractors, in the  form of a letter of credit or equivalent financial assurance.</p>
