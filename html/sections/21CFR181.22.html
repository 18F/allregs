                            <p class="depth0">Prior to the enactment of the food additives amendment to the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, sanctions were granted for the  usage of the substances listed in Secs. 181.23, 181.24, 181.25, 181.26,  181.27, 181.28, 181.29, and 181.30 in the manufacture of packaging  materials. So used, these substances are not considered ``food  additives'' within the meaning of section 201(s) of the Act, provided  that they are of good commercial grade, are suitable for association  with food, and are used in accordance with good manufacturing practice.  For the purpose of this subpart, good manufacturing practice for food- packaging materials includes the restriction that the quantity of any of  these substances which becomes a component of food as a result of use in  food-packaging materials shall not be intended to accomplish any  physical or technical effect in the food itself, shall be reduced to the  least amount reasonably possible, and shall not exceed any limit  specified in this subpart.
