The Associate Administrator's decision will be based upon the following considerations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the State DOT has a process for identifying RD&T; needs and for implementing a viable RD&T; program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the State DOT is contributing to cooperative RD&T; programs or activities, such as the National Cooperative Highway Research Program, the Transportation Research Board, and transportation pooled fund studies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the State DOT is using SPR funds for technology transfer and for transit or intermodal research and development to help meet the 25 percent minimum requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the State DOT can demonstrate that it will meet the requirement or substantially increase its RD&T; expenditures over a multi-year period, if an exception is granted for the fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether Federal funds needed for planning exceed the 75 percent limit for the fiscal year and whether any unused planning funds are available from previous fiscal years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the FHWA Associate Administrator for Research, Development, and Technology approves the State DOT's request for an exception, the exception is valid only for that fiscal year's funds. A new request must be submitted and approved for subsequent fiscal year funds.</p>
