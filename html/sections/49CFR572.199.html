                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The iliac is part of the lower torso assembly shown in drawing 180-4000. The iliac test is conducted by impacting the side of the lower torso of the assembled dummy (drawing 180-0000). The dummy is equipped with a laterally oriented pelvis accelerometer as specified in 49 CFR 572.200(d), and iliac wing load cell SA572-S66, mounted as shown in sheet 2 of 5 of drawing 180-0000. When subjected to the test procedure as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the pelvis shall meet performance requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test procedure. (1) Soak the dummy assembly (180-0000) in a test environment as specified in 49 CFR 572.200(j).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Soak the dummy assembly (180-0000) in a test environment as specified in 49 CFR 572.200(j).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Seat the dummy, without the torso jacket and without cotton underwear pants, as shown in Figure V9-A in appendix A to this subpart, on a flat, rigid, horizontal surface covered with a 2-mm-thick PTFE (Teflon) sheet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The legs are outstretched in front of the dummy such that they are symmetrical about the midsagittal plane, the thighs touch the seated surface, the inner part of the right and left legs at the knees are as close as possible to each other, and the feet are in full

dorsiflexion and as close together as possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Orient the arm downward to the lowest detent such that the longitudinal centerline of the arm is parallel to the inferior-superior orientation of the spine box.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The midsagittal plane of the dummy is vertical, and superior surface of the lower half neck assembly load cell replacement (180-3815) in the lateral direction is within 1 degree relative to the horizontal as shown in Figure V9-A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> While maintaining the dummy's position as specified in paragraphs (b)(3), (4) and (5) of this section, the top of the shoulder rib mount (180-3352) orientation in the fore-and-aft direction is within 1.0 degree relative to horizontal as shown in Figure V9-B in Appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The pelvis impactor is specified in 49 CFR 572.200(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The dummy is positioned with respect to the impactor such that the longitudinal centerline of the impact probe is in line with the longitudinal centerline of the iliac load cell access hole, and the 88.9 mm dimension of the probe's impact surface is aligned horizontally.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The impactor is guided, if needed, so that at contact with the pelvis, the longitudinal axis of the impactor is within 1 degree of a horizontal plane and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane of the dummy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The dummy's pelvis is impacted at the iliac location at 4.30.1 m/s.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Allow a period of at least 120 minutes between successive tests of the same pelvis assembly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Performance criteria. While the impactor is in contact with the pelvis:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Peak acceleration of the impactor is not less than 36 g and not more than 45 g;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Peak acceleration of the pelvis is not less than 28 g and not more than 39 g;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Peak iliac force is not less than 4.10 kN and not more than 5.10 kN.
