                            <p class="depth0">You may certify freshly manufactured or remanufactured locomotives  using non-locomotive-specific engines (as defined in Sec.  1033.901)  using the normal certification procedures of this part. Locomotives  certified in that way are generally treated the same as other  locomotives, except where specified otherwise. The provisions of this  section provide for design certification to the locomotive standards in  this part for locomotives using engines included in engine families  certified under 40 CFR part 1039 (or part 89) in limited circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Remanufactured or freshly manufactured switch locomotives  powered by non-locomotive-specific engines may be certified by design  without the test data required by Sec.  1033.235 if all of the following  are true:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before being installed in the locomotive, the engines were  covered by a certificate of conformity issued under 40 CFR Part 1039 (or  part 89) that is effective for the calendar year in which the  manufacture or remanufacture occurs. You may use engines certified  during the previous years if they were subject to the same standards.  You may not make any modifications to the engines unless we approve  them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The engines were certified to PM, NOX, and  hydrocarbon standards that are numerically lower than the applicable  locomotive standards of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> More engines are reasonably projected to be sold and used under  the certificate for non-locomotive use than for use in locomotives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The number of such locomotives certified under this section does  not exceed 30 in any three-year period. We may waive this sales limit  for locomotive models that have previously demonstrated compliance with  the locomotive standards of Sec.  1033.101 in-use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> We approved the application as specified in paragraph (d) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To certify your locomotives by design under this section, submit  your application as specified in Sec.  1033.205, with the following  exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include the following instead of the locomotive test data  otherwise required by Sec.  1033.205:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the engines to be used, including the name of  the engine manufacturer and engine family identifier for the engines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A brief engineering analysis describing how the engine's  emission controls will function when installed in the locomotive  throughout the locomotive's useful life.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The emission data submitted under 40 CFR part 1039 (or part  89).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may separately submit some of the information required by  Sec.  1033.205, consistent with the provisions of Sec.  1033.1(d). For  example, this may be an appropriate way to submit detailed information  about proprietary engine software. Note that this allowance to  separately submit some of the information required by Sec.  1033.205 is  also available for applications not submitted under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Locomotives certified under this section are subject to all the  requirements of this part except as specified in paragraph (b) of this  section. The engines used in such locomotives are not considered to be  included in the otherwise applicable engines family of 40 CFR part 1039  (or part 89).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We will approve or deny the application as specified in subpart  C of this part. For example, we will deny your application for  certification by design under this section in any case where we have  evidence that your locomotives will not conform to the requirements of  this part throughout their useful lives.
