See 301.604 for responsibilities that Contracting  Officers may delegate to technical personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contracting Officers may designate individuals as ordering or  approving officials to make purchases or place/approve orders under  blanket purchase agreements (BPAs), indefinite-delivery, indefinite  quantity (IDIQ) contracts, or other pre-established mechanisms.
