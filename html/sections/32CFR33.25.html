                                Sec. 33.25  Program income.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray  program costs. Program income includes income   from fees for services performed, from the use or rental of real or  personal property acquired with grant funds, from the sale of  commodities or items fabricated under a grant agreement, and from  payments of principal and interest on loans made with grant funds.  Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Federal agency,  program income does not include interest on grant funds, rebates,  credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on any of them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition of program income. Program income means gross income  received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant  supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement  during the grant period. ``During the grant period'' is the time between  the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award  reflected in the final financial report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal  regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of  program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program  income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Governmental revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies,  fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not  program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the  grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Royalties. Income from royalties and license fees for  copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or  subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically  identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as  program income. (See Sec. 33.34.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment  will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Secs. 33.31 and  33.32.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> (2) and (3) of this  section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be  deducted from outlays.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Deduction. Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from  total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program  income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency  authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not  anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal  agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds  committed to the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Addition. When authorized, program income may be added to the  funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the  grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the  conditions of the grant agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cost sharing or matching. When authorized, program income may be  used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant  agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Income after the award period. There are no Federal requirements  governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the  award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report,  see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or  the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.
