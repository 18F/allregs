                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The filler metal used in brazing must be a nonferrous metal or  alloy having a melting point above 1,000 [deg]F. and below that of the  metal being joined. The filler metal must meet and flow freely within  the desired temperature range and, in conjunction with a suitable flux  or controlled atmosphere, must wet and adhere to the surfaces to be  joined. Prior to using a particular brazing material in a piping system,  the requirements of Sec. 56.60-20 of this part should be considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The brazing material used shall have a shearing strength of at  least 10,000 pounds per square inch. The maximum allowable working  pressure for brazing piping shall be determined by this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fluxes that are fluid and chemically active at the brazing  temperature must be used when necessary to prevent oxidation of the  filler metal and of the surfaces to be joined and to promote free  flowing of the filler metal.
