                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Flood insurance. No property improvement loan or manufactured  home loan shall be eligible for insurance under this part if the  property securing repayment of the loan is located in a special flood  hazard area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA), unless flood insurance on the property is obtained by the  borrower in compliance with section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection  Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4012a). Such insurance shall be obtained at any  time during the term of the loan that the lender determines that the  secured property is located in a special flood hazard area identified by  FEMA, and shall be maintained by the borrower for the remaining term of  the loan, or until the lender determines that the property is no longer  in a special flood hazard area, or until the property is repossessed or  foreclosed upon by the lender. The amount of such insurance shall be at  least equal to the unpaid balance of the Title I loan, and the lender  shall be named as the loss payee for flood insurance benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em>. Upon acquiring title to the property through  repossession or foreclosure, the lender shall maintain hazard insurance  upon the property in the amount prescribed above until its disposition  and sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Coastal barriers properties. No title I insurance shall be made  available under this part for any property improvement loan or  manufactured home loan except pursuant to a loan application approved  before October 18, 1982, with respect to any property within the Coastal  Barriers Resources System   established by the Coastal Barriers Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 3501).
