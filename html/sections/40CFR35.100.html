These provisions  supplement the EPA general assistance regulations in 2 CFR parts 200 and  1500. Sections 35.100-35.118 contain administrative requirements that  apply to all environmental program grants included in this subpart.  Sections 35.130-35.418 contain requirements that apply to specified  environmental program grants. Many of these environmental programs also  have programmatic and technical requirements   that are published elsewhere in the Code of Federal Regulations.
