                                Sec. 1.338-1  General principles; status of old target and new target.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Deemed transaction. Elections are available  under section 338 when a purchasing corporation acquires the stock of  another corporation (the target) in a qualified stock purchase. One type  of election, under section 338(g), is available to the purchasing  corporation. Another type of election, under section 338(h)(10), is, in  more limited circumstances, available jointly to the purchasing  corporation and the sellers of the stock. (Rules concerning eligibility  for these elections are contained in Sec. Sec. 1.338-2, 1.338-3, and  1.338(h)(10)-1.) However, if, as a result of the deemed purchase of old  target's assets pursuant to a section 336(e) election, there would be  both a qualified stock purchase and a qualified stock disposition (as  defined in Sec. 1.336-1(b)(6)) of the stock of a subsidiary of target,  neither a section 338(g) election nor a section 338(h)(10) election may  be made with respect to the qualified stock purchase of the subsidiary.  Instead, a section 336(e) election may be made with respect to such  purchase. See Sec. 1.336-1(b)(6)(ii). Although target is a single  corporation under corporate law, if a section 338 election is made, then  two separate corporations, old target and new target, generally are  considered to exist for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue  Code. Old target is treated as transferring all of its assets to an  unrelated person in exchange for consideration that includes the  discharge of its liabilities (see Sec. 1.1001-2(a)), and new target is  treated as acquiring all of its assets from an unrelated person in  exchange for consideration that includes the assumption of those  liabilities. (Such transaction is, without regard to its  characterization for Federal income tax purposes, referred to as the  deemed asset sale and the income tax consequences thereof as the deemed  sale tax consequences.) If a section 338(h)(10) election is made, old  target is deemed to liquidate following the deemed asset sale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. Other rules of law may  characterize the transaction as something other than or in addition to a  sale and purchase of assets; however, the transaction between old and  new target must be a taxable transaction. For example, if the target is  an insurance company for which a section 338 election is made, the  deemed asset sale results in an assumption reinsurance transaction for  the insurance contracts deemed transferred from old target to new  target. See, generally, Sec. 1.817-4(d), and for special rules  regarding the acquisition of insurance company targets, Sec. 1.338-11.  See also Sec. 1.367(a)-8(k)(13) for a rule applicable to gain  recognition agreements (filed under Sec. Sec. 1.367(a)-3(b)(1)(ii) and  1.367(a)-8) and deemed asset sales as a result of an election under  section 338(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Overview. Definitions and special nomenclature and rules for  making the section 338 election are provided in Sec. 1.338-2.  Qualification for the section 338 election is addressed in Sec. 1.338- 3. The amount for which old target is treated as selling all of its  assets (the aggregate deemed sale price, or ADSP) is addressed in Sec.  1.338-4. The amount for which new target is deemed to have   purchased all its assets (the adjusted grossed-up basis, or AGUB) is  addressed in Sec. 1.338-5. Section 1.338-6 addresses allocation both of  ADSP among the assets old target is deemed to have sold and of AGUB  among the assets new target is deemed to have purchased. Section 1.338-7  addresses allocation of ADSP or AGUB when those amounts subsequently  change. Asset and stock consistency are addressed in Sec. 1.338-8.  International aspects of section 338 are covered in Sec. 1.338-9. Rules  for the filing of returns are provided in Sec. 1.338-10. Section 1.338- 11 provides special rules for insurance company targets. Eligibility for  and treatment of section 338(h)(10) elections is addressed in Sec.  1.338(h)(10)-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Treatment of target under other provisions of the Internal  Revenue Code--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule for subtitle A. Except as provided in  this section, new target is treated as a new corporation that is  unrelated to old target for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal  Revenue Code. Thus--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> New target is not considered related to old target for purposes  of section 168 and may make new elections under section 168 without  taking into account the elections made by old target; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> New target may adopt, without obtaining prior approval from the  Commissioner, any taxable year that meets the requirements of section  441 and any method of accounting that meets the requirements of section  446. Notwithstanding Sec. 1.441-1T(b)(2), a new target may adopt a  taxable year on or before the last day for making the election under  section 338 by filing its first return for the desired taxable year on  or before that date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions for subtitle A. New target and old target are treated  as the same corporation for purposes of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The rules applicable to employee benefit plans (including those  plans described in sections 79, 104, 105, 106, 125, 127, 129, 132, 137,  and 220), qualified pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus and annuity  plans (sections 401(a) and 403(a)), simplified employee pensions  (section 408(k)), tax qualified stock option plans (sections 422 and  423), welfare benefit funds (sections 419, 419A, 512(a)(3), and 4976),  and voluntary employee benefit associations (section 501(c)(9) and the  regulations thereunder);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sections 1311 through 1314 (relating to the mitigation of the  effect of limitations), if a section 338(h)(10) election is not made for  target;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Section 108(e)(5) (relating to the reduction of purchase money  debt);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Section 45A (relating to the Indian Employment Credit), section  51 (relating to the Work Opportunity Credit), section 51A (relating to  the Welfare to Work Credit), and section 1396 (relating to the  Empowerment Zone Act);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Sections 401(h) and 420 (relating to medical benefits for  retirees);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Section 414 (relating to definitions and special rules); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Section 846(e) (relating to an election to use an insurance  company's historical loss payment pattern).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Any other provision designated in the Internal Revenue  Bulletin by the Internal Revenue Service. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of  this chapter. See, for example, Sec. 1.1001-3(e)(4)(i)(F) providing  that an election under section 338 does not result in the substitution  of a new obligor on target's debt. See also, for example, Sec. 1.1502- 77(c)(8), providing that an election under section 338 does not result  in a deemed termination of target's existence for purposes of the rules  applicable to the agent for a consolidated group.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> General rule for other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  Except as provided in the regulations under section 338 or in the  Internal Revenue Bulletin by the Internal Revenue Service (see Sec.  601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter), new target is treated as a  continuation of old target for purposes other than subtitle A of the  Internal Revenue Code. For example--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> New target is liable for old target's Federal income tax  liabilities, including the tax liability for the deemed sale tax  consequences and those tax liabilities of the other members of any  consolidated group that included old target that are attributable to  taxable years in which those corporations and old target joined in the  same consolidated return (see Sec. 1.1502-6(a));</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Wages earned by the employees of old target are considered  wages earned   by such employees from new target for purposes of sections 3101 and 3111  (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) and section 3301 (Federal  Unemployment Tax Act); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Old target and new target must use the same employer  identification number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> includes the making of any appropriate correlative  adjustments (avoiding, to the extent possible, the duplication or  omission of any item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or basis).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Prior to a qualified stock purchase under section 338,  target transfers one of its assets to a related party. The purchasing  corporation then purchases the target stock and also purchases the  transferred asset from the related party. After its purchase of target,  the purchasing corporation and target are members of the same affiliated  group. A section 338 election is made. Under an arrangement with the  purchaser, the separately transferred asset is used primarily in  connection with target's activities. Applying the anti-abuse rule of  this paragraph (c), the Commissioner may consider target to own the  transferred asset for purposes of applying the residual method under  section 338.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. T owns all the stock of T1. T1 leases intellectual  property to T, which T uses in connection with its own activities. P, a  purchasing corporation, wishes to buy the T-T1 chain of corporations. P,  in connection with its planned purchase of the T stock, contracts to  consummate a purchase of all the stock of T1 on March 1 and of all the  stock of T on March 2. Section 338 elections are thereafter made for  both T and T1. Immediately after the purchases, P, T and T1 are members  of the same affiliated group. T continues to lease the intellectual  property from T1 and that is the primary use of the intellectual  property. Thus, an asset of T, the T1 stock, was removed from T's own  assets prior to the qualified stock purchase of the T stock, T1's own  assets are used after the deemed asset sale in connection with T's own  activities, and the T1 stock is after the deemed asset sale owned by P,  a member of the same affiliated group of which T is a member. Applying  the anti-abuse rule of this paragraph (c), the Commissioner may, for  purposes of application of the residual method under section 338 both to  T and to T1, consider P to have bought only the stock of T, with T at  the time of the qualified stock purchases of both T and T1 (the  qualified stock purchase of T1 being triggered by the deemed sale under  section 338 of T's assets) owning T1. The Commissioner accordingly would  allocate consideration to T's assets as though the T1 stock were one of  those assets, and then allocate consideration within T1 based on the  amount allocated to the T1 stock at the T level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Next day rule for post-closing transactions. If a target  corporation for   which an election under section 338 is made engages in a transaction  outside the ordinary course of business on the acquisition date after  the event resulting in the qualified stock purchase of the target or a  higher tier corporation, the target and all persons related thereto  (either before or after the qualified stock purchase) under section  267(b) or section 707 must treat the transaction for all Federal income  tax purposes as occurring at the beginning of the day following the  transaction and after the deemed purchase by new target.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (c)(1) of  this section are applicable to any qualified stock disposition for which  the disposition date (as defined in Sec. 1.336-1(b)(8)) is on or after  May 15, 2013.  [T.D. 8940, 66 FR 9929, Feb. 13, 2001, as amended by T.D. 9002, 67 FR  43540, June 28, 2002; T.D. 9257, 71 FR 18000, Apr. 10, 2006; T.D. 9377,  73 FR 3871, Jan. 23, 2008; T.D. 9446, 74 FR 6957, Feb. 11, 2009; T.D.  9619, 78 FR 28489, May 15, 2013; T.D. 9715, 80 FR 17318, Apr. 1, 2015]</p>
