                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prisoners who demonstrate superior program achievement (in  addition to a good conduct record) may be considered for a limited  advancement of the presumptive date previously set according to the  schedule below. Such reduction will normally be considered at an interim  hearing or pre-release review. It is to be stressed that a clear conduct  record is expected; this reduction applies only to cases with documented  sustained superior program achievement over a period of 9 months or more  in custody.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Superior program achievement may be demonstrated in areas such  as educational, vocational, industry, or counseling programs, and is to  be considered in light of the specifics of each case. A report from the  Bureau of Prisons based upon successful completion of a residential  substance abuse program of at least 500 hours will be given prompt  review by the Commission for a possible advancement under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon a finding of superior program achievement, a previously set  presumptive date may be advanced. The normal maximum advancement  permissible for superior program achievement during the prisoner's  entire term shall be as set forth in the following schedule. It is the  intent of the Commission that this maximum be exceeded only in the most  clearly exceptional cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Partial advancements may be given (for example, a case with  superior program achievement during only part of the term or a case with  both superior program achievement and minor disciplinary infraction(s)).  Advancements may be given at different times; however, the limits set  forth in the following schedule shall apply to the total combined  advancement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Schedule of Permissible Reductions for Superior Program  Achievement.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Total months required by original</p><p class="depth2">presumptive date                   Permissible reduction ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 14 months or less.........................

Up to 12 months. 91 plus months............................  Up to 13 months. \1\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1\ Plus up to 1 additional month for each 6 months or fraction thereof,</p><p class="depth2">by which the original date exceeds 96 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For cases originally continued to expiration, the statutory good  time date (calculated under 18 U.S.C. 4161) will be used for computing  the maximum reduction permissible and as the base from which the  reduction is to be subtracted for prisoners serving sentences of less  than five years. For prisoners serving sentences of five or more, the  two-thirds date (calculated pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4206(d)) will be used  for these purposes. If the prisoner's presumptive release date has been  further reduced by extra good time (18 U.S.C. 4162) and such reduction  equals or exceeds the reduction applicable for superior program  achievement, the Commission will not give an additional reduction for  superior program achievement.
