                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) You must meet each emission limit and work practice standard in Table 1 to this subpart that applies to you, and you must meet each applicable requirement specified in Sec. 63.8000(b), except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must meet each emission limit and work practice standard in Table 1 to this subpart that applies to you, and you must meet each applicable requirement specified in Sec. 63.8000(b), except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You are not required to meet the emission limits and work practice standards in Table 1 to this subpart if you comply with Sec. 63.8050 or Sec. 63.8055.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must meet the emission limits and work practice standards in Table 1 to this subpart for emissions from automatic cleaning operations. You are not required to meet the emission limits and work practice standards in Table 1 to this subpart for emissions from cleaning operations that are conducted manually.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each control device used to comply with Table 1 to this subpart, you must comply with subpart SS of this part 63 as specified in Sec. 63.8000(c), except as specified in Sec. 63.8000(d) and paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When subpart SS of this part 63 refers to process vents, it means process vessel vents for the purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Process condensers, as defined in Sec. 63.1251, are not considered to be control devices for process vessels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Initial compliance. (1) To demonstrate initial compliance with a percent reduction emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you must conduct the performance test or design evaluation under conditions as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(1), except that the performance test or design evaluation must be conducted under worst-case conditions. Also, the performance test for a control device used to control emissions from process vessels must be conducted according to Sec. 63.1257(b)(8), including the submittal of a site-specific test plan for approval prior to testing. The requirements in Sec. 63.997(e)(1)(i) and (iii) also do not apply for performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission limits for process vessels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To demonstrate initial compliance with a percent reduction emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you must conduct the performance test or design evaluation under conditions as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(1), except that the performance test or design evaluation must be conducted under worst-case conditions. Also, the performance test for a control device used to control emissions from process vessels must be conducted according to Sec. 63.1257(b)(8), including the submittal of a site-specific test plan for approval prior to testing. The requirements in Sec. 63.997(e)(1)(i) and (iii) also do not apply for performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission limits for process vessels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the initial compliance demonstration for condensers, you must determine uncontrolled emissions using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1257(d)(2), and you must determine controlled emissions using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1257(d)(3)(i)(B) and (iii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must demonstrate that each process condenser is properly operated according to the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(C)(4)(ii) and (d)(3)(iii)(B). The reference in Sec. 63.1257(d)(3)(iii)(B) to the alternative standard in Sec. 63.1254(c) does not apply for the purposes of this subpart. As an alternative to measuring the exhaust gas temperature, as required by Sec. 63.1257(d)(3)(iii)(B), you may elect to measure the liquid temperature in the receiver.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must conduct a performance test or compliance demonstration equivalent to an initial compliance demonstration within 360 hours of a change in operating conditions that are not considered to be within the previously established worst-case conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Establishing operating limits. You must establish operating limits under the conditions required for your initial compliance demonstration, except you may elect to establish operating limit(s) for conditions other than those under which a performance test was conducted as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The operating limits may be based on the results of the performance test and supplementary information such as engineering assessments and manufacturer's recommendations. These limits may be established for conditions as unique as individual emission episodes. You must provide rationale in the precompliance report for the specific level for each operating limit, including any data and calculations used to develop the limit and a description of why the limit indicates proper operation of the control device. The procedures provided in this paragraph (e)(1) have not been approved by the Administrator and determination of the operating limit using these procedures is subject to review and approval by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you elect to establish separate operating limits for different emission episodes, you must maintain records as specified in Sec. 63.8085(g) of each point at which you change from one operating limit to another, even if the duration of the monitoring for an operating limit is less than 15 minutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Averaging periods. If you elect to establish separate operating limits for different emission episodes, you may elect to determine operating block averages instead of the daily averages specified in Sec. 63.998(b)(3). An operating block is a period of time that is equal to the time from the beginning to end of an emission episode or sequence of emission episodes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Flow indicators. If flow to a control device could be intermittent, you must install, calibrate, and operate a flow indicator at the inlet or outlet of the control device to identify periods of no flow. Periods of no flow may not be used in daily or block averages, and it may not be used in fulfilling a minimum data availability requirement.
