                            <p class="depth0">Pool plant means a plant, unit of plants, or system of plants as specified in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, but excluding a plant specified in paragraph (h) of this section. The pooling standards described in paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section are subject to modification pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A distributing plant, other than a plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or (Sec. --------.7b) of any other Federal milk order, from which during the month 15 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) are disposed of as route disposition or are transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to

other distributing plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and transfers must be to outlets in the marketing area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any distributing plant located in the marketing area which during the month processed at least 15 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) into ultra-pasteurized or aseptically-processed fluid milk products.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A supply plant from which the quantity of bulk fluid milk products shipped to (and physically unloaded into) plants described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not less than 10 percent of the Grade A milk received from dairy farmers (except dairy farmers described in Sec. 1030.12(b)) and handlers described in Sec. 1000.9(c), including milk diverted pursuant to Sec. 1030.13, subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Qualifying shipments may be made to plants described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, except that whenever shipping requirements are increased pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, only shipments to pool plants described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (e) of this section shall count as qualifying shipments for the purpose of meeting the increased shipments:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pool plants described in Sec. 1030.7(a), (b), (d), and (e);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Plants of producer-handlers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Partially regulated distributing plants, except that credit for such shipments shall be limited to the amount of such milk classified as Class I at the transferee plant; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Distributing plants fully regulated under other Federal orders, except that credit for shipments to such plants shall be limited to the quantity shipped to pool distributing plants during the month and credits for shipments to other order plants shall not include any such shipments made on the basis of agreed-upon Class II, Class III, or Class IV utilization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The operator of a supply plant located within the States of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan may include as qualifying shipments under this paragraph milk delivered directly from producers' farms pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1000.9(c) or 1030.13(c) to plants described in paragraphs (a), (b), (d) and (e) of this section. Handlers may not use shipments pursuant to Sec. 1000.9(c) or Sec. 1030.13(c) to qualify plants located outside the area described above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Concentrated milk transferred from the supply plant to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I shall be excluded from the supply plant's shipments in computing the supply plant's shipping percentage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any distributing plant, located within the marketing area as described on May 1, 2006, in Sec. 1030.2;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From which there is route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk provided that 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) is disposed of as route disposition and/or is transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and/or transfers, in aggregate, are in any non-federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk. Subject to the following exclusions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The plant is described in Sec. 1030.7(a), (b), or (e);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The plant is subject to the pricing provisions of a State-operated milk pricing plan which provides for the payment of minimum class prices for raw milk;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The plant is described in Sec. 1000.8(a) or (e); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A producer-handler described in Sec. 1030.10 with less than three million pounds during the month of route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products to other plants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Two or more plants operated by the same handler and located in the marketing area may qualify for pool status as a unit by meeting the total

and in-area route disposition requirements of a pool distributing plant specified in paragraph (a) of this section and subject to the following additional requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least one of the plants in the unit must qualify as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other plants in the unit must process Class I or Class II products, using 50 percent or more of the total Grade A fluid milk products received in bulk form at such plant or diverted therefrom by the plant operator in Class I or Class II products; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The operator of the unit has filed a written request with the market administrator prior to the first day of the month for which such status is desired to be effective. The unit shall continue from month-to-month thereafter without further notification. The handler shall notify the market administrator in writing prior to the first day of any month for which termination or any change of the unit is desired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A system of 2 or more supply plants operated by one or more handlers may qualify for pooling by meeting the shipping requirements of paragraph (c) of this section in the same manner as a single plant subject to the following additional requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each plant in the system is located within the marketing area or was a pool supply plant pursuant to Sec. 1030.7(c) for each of the 3 months immediately preceding the applicability date of this paragraph so long as it continues to maintain pool status. Cooperative associations may not use shipments pursuant to Sec. 1000.9(c) to qualify plants located outside the marketing area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The handler(s) establishing the system submits a written request to the market administrator on or before July 15 requesting that such plants qualify as a system for the period of August through July of the following year. Such request will contain a list of the plants participating in the system in the order, beginning with the last plant, in which the plants will be dropped from the system if the system fails to qualify. Each plant that qualifies as a pool plant within a system shall continue each month as a plant in the system through the following July unless the handler(s) establishing the system submits a written request to the market administrator that the plant be deleted from the system or that the system be discontinued. Any plant that has been so deleted from a system, or that has failed to qualify in any month, will not be part of any system for the remaining months through July. The handler(s) that established a system may add a plant operated by such handler(s) to a system if such plant has been a pool plant each of the 6 prior months and would otherwise be eligible to be in a system, upon written request to the market administrator no later than the 15th day of the prior month. In the event of an ownership change or the business failure of a handler that is a participant in a system, the system may be reorganized to reflect such changes if a written request to file a new marketing agreement is submitted to the market administrator; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a system fails to qualify under the requirements of this paragraph, the handler responsible for qualifying the system shall notify the market administrator which plant or plants will be deleted from the system so that the remaining plants may be pooled as a system. If the handler fails to do so, the market administrator shall exclude one or more plants, beginning at the bottom of the list of plants in the system and continuing up the list as necessary until the deliveries are sufficient to qualify the remaining plants in the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section and Sec. 1030.13(d)(2), and (d)(3) may be increased or decreased, for all or part of the marketing area, by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation

shows that an adjustment of the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable shipping or diversion percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A producer-handler as defined under any Federal order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An exempt plant as defined in Sec. 1000.8(e);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A plant located within the marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order, and from which more than 50 percent of its route disposition has been in the other Federal order marketing area for 3 consecutive months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A plant located outside any Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and has had greater route disposition in such other Federal order's marketing area for 3 consecutive months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A plant located in another Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of such other Federal order and does not have a majority of its route distribution in this marketing area for 3 consecutive months or if the plant is required to be regulated under such other Federal order without regard to its route disposition in any other Federal order marketing area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made to plants regulated under the other Federal order than are made to plants regulated under the order in this part, or the plant has automatic pooling status under the other Federal order; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> That portion of a regulated plant designated as a nonpool plant that is physically separate and operated separately from the pool portion of such plant. The designation of a portion of a regulated plant as a nonpool plant must be requested in advance and in writing by the handler and must be approved by the market administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any plant that qualifies as a pool plant in each of the immediately preceding 3 months pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or the shipping percentages in paragraph (c) of this section that is unable to meet such performance standards for the current month because of unavoidable circumstances determined by the market administrator to be beyond the control of the handler operating the plant, such as a natural disaster (ice storm, wind storm, flood), fire, breakdown of equipment, or work stoppage, shall be considered to have met the minimum performance standards during the period of such unavoidable circumstances, but such relief shall not be granted for more than 2 consecutive months.
