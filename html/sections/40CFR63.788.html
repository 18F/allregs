If a violation at an affected source is detected, the owner or operator of the affected source shall also report the information specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for the reporting period during which the violation(s) occurred. To the extent possible, the report shall be organized according to the compliance procedure(s) followed each month by the affected source. If there was a malfunction during the reporting period, the report must also include the number, duration and a brief description of each malfunction which occurred during the reporting period and which caused or may have caused any applicable emission limitation to be exceeded. The report must also include a description of

actions taken by an owner or operator during a malfunction of an affected source to minimize emissions in accordance with Sec.  63.783(b)(1), including actions taken to correct a malfunction.
