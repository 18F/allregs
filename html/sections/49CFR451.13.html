                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The approval authority arranges with the manufacturer, with notification to the owner, to witness the prototype tests required by the convention, and to examine any number of containers that the approval authority considers appropriate. Upon witnessing successful completion of prototype tests and examination of several containers the approval authority issues to the owner, a notice of approval which authorizes the attachment of safety approval plates to the containers. Absence of individual inspections will not relieve the manufacturer of any responsibility to maintain proper quality control. If a prototype container fails to pass the tests, the approval authority may require testing of as many further representative containers as necessary to ensure the adequacy of the design.</p>
