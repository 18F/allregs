                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acquired lands--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The Coal Leasing Amendments Act of  1975, hereinafter referred to as the act, amended the Mineral Leasing  Act for Acquired Lands (30 U.S.C. 352) and permits the Secretary of  Interior (SI), with the consent of the Secretary of   Defense, to lease deposits of coal, phosphate, oil, oil shale, gas,  sodium, potassium and sulfur which are within acquired lands of the  United States which have been set aside for military or naval purposes.  The consent requirement is to insure the adequate utilization of the  lands for the primary purposes for which they have been acquired or are  being administered. Leasing is subject to the same conditions as  contained in the leasing provisions of the mineral leasing laws (see 30  U.S.C. 351). Authority in this paragraph does not permit leasing of  mineral deposits lying in tidelands, submerged lands, nor in certain  coastal waters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, leasing of coal  and lignite deposits is subject to special restrictions. The act permits  such leasing, provided the Secretary of Defense concurs, only to a  governmental entity (including any corporation primarily acting as an  agency or instrumentality of a State) which provides electrical energy  for sale to the public if such governmental entity is located in the  State in which such lands are located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public domain lands. Deposits of coal, phosphate, sodium,  potassium, oil, oil shale, native asphalt, solid and semi-solid bitumen,  bituminous rock and gas located on public domain lands under the  jurisdiction of the Department of the Army may be leased by the SI  pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 181 et seq. with the concurrence of the Secretary  of the Army.</p>
