In computing the loads, the yawing velocity may be assumed to be zero:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With the airplane in unaccelerated flight at zero yaw, it is assumed that the rudder control is suddenly displaced to the maximum deflection, as limited by the control stops or by limit pilot forces.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With the rudder deflected as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, it is assumed that the airplane yaws to the overswing sideslip angle.
