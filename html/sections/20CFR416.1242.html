                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In order for payment conditioned on the disposition of nonliquid  resources to be made, the individual must agree in writing to dispose of  real property within 9 months and personal property within 3 months. The  time period for disposal of property begins on the date we accept the  individual's signed written agreement to dispose of the property. If we  receive a signed agreement on or after the date we have determined that  the individual meets the eligibility requirements described in  Sec. 416.202 of this part, with the exception of the resource  requirements described in this subpart, our acceptance of the written  agreement will occur on the date the individual receives our written  notice that the agreement is in effect. If we receive a signed agreement  prior to the date we determine that all nonresource requirements are  met, our acceptance of the written agreement will not occur until the  date the individual receives our written notice that all nonresource  requirements are met and that the agreement is in effect. When the  written notice is mailed to the individual, we assume that the notice  was received 5 days after the date shown on the notice unless the  individual shows us that he or she did not receive it within the 5-day  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An individual will be found to have ``good cause'' for failing  to dispose of a resource if, despite reasonable and diligent effort on  his part, he was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from  disposing of the resource.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In determining whether the appropriate time limits discussed in  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section have elapsed, no month will be  counted for which an individual's benefits have been suspended as  described in Sec. 416.1320, provided that the reason for the suspension  is unrelated to the requirements in Sec. 416.1245(b) and that the  individual's eligibility has not been terminated as defined in  Secs. 416.1331 through 416.1335.
