Sec. 2711.3-1  Competitive bidding.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When public lands are offered through competitive bidding:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The date, time, place, and manner for submitting bids shall be specified in the notice required by Sec. 2711.1-2 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Bids may be made by a principal or a duly qualified agent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Sealed bids shall be considered only if received at the place of sale prior to the hour fixed in the notice and are made for at least the fair market value. Each bid shall be accompanied by certified check, postal money order, bank draft or cashier's check made payable to the Bureau of Land Management for the amount required in the notice of realty action which shall be not less than 10 percent or more than 30 percent of the amount of the bid, and shall be enclosed in a sealed envelope which shall be marked as prescribed in the notice. If 2 or more envelopes containing valid bids of the same amount are received, the determination of which is to be considered the highest bid shall be by supplemental biddings. The designated high bidders shall be allowed to submit oral or sealed bids as designated by the authorized officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The highest qualifying sealed bid received shall be publicly declared by the authorized officer. If the notice published pursuant to Sec. 2711.1-2 of this title provides for oral bids, such bids, in increments specified by the authorized officer, shall then be invited. After oral bids, if any, are received, the highest qualifying bid, designated by type, whether sealed or oral, shall be declared by the authorized officer. The person declared to have entered the highest qualifying oral bid shall submit payment by cash, personal check, bank draft, money order, or any combination for not less than one-fifth of the amount of the bid immediately following the close of the sale. The successful bidder, whether such bid is a sealed or oral bid, shall submit the remainder of the full bid price prior to the expiration of 180 days from the date of the sale. Failure to submit the full bid price prior to, but not including the 180th day following the day of the sale, shall result in cancellation of the sale of the specific parcel and the deposit shall be forfeited and disposed of as other receipts of sale. In the event the authorized officer rejects the highest qualified bid or releases the bidder from it, the authorized officer shall determine whether the public lands shall be withdrawn from the market or be reoffered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If the public lands are not sold pursuant to the notice issued under Sec. 2711.1-2 of this subpart, they may remain available for sale on a continuing basis until sold as specified in the notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The acceptance or rejection of any offer to purchase shall be in writing no later than 30 days after receipt of such offer unless the offerer waives his right to a decision within such 30-day period. In case of a tract of land in excess of 2,500 acres, such acceptance or rejection shall not be given until the expiration of 30 days after the end of the notice to the Congress provided for in Sec. 2711.1-2(d) of this subpart. Prior to the expiration of such periods the authorized officer may refuse to accept any offer or may withdraw any tract from sale if he determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Consummation of the sale would be inconsistent with the provisions of any existing law; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Collusive or other activities have hindered or restrained free and open bidding; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consummation of the sale would encourage or promote speculation in public lands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Until the acceptance of the offer and payment of the purchase price, the bidder has no contractual or other rights against the United States, and no action taken shall create any contractual or other obligations of the United States.

Sec. 2711.3-2  Modified bidding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Public lands may be offered for sale utilizing modified competitive bidding procedures when the authorized officer determines it is necessary in order to assure equitable distribution of land among purchasers or to recognize equitable considerations or public policies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Modified competitive bidding includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Offering to designated bidders the right to meet the highest bid. Refusal or failure to meet the highest bid shall constitute a waiver of such bidding provisions; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A limitation of persons permitted to bid on a specific tract of land offered for sale; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Offering to designated bidders the right of first refusal to purchase the lands at fair market value. Failure to accept an offer to purchase the offered lands within the time specified by the authorized officer shall constitute a waiver of his preference consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Factors that shall be considered in determining when modified competitive bidding procedures shall be used, include but are not limited to: Needs of State and/or local government, adjoining landowners, historical users, and other needs for the tract. A description of the method of modified competitive bidding to be used and a statement indicating the purpose or objective of the bidding procedure selected shall be specified in the notice of realty action required in Sec. 2711.1-2 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Where 2 or more designated bidders exercise preference consideration awarded by the authorized officer in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, such bidders shall be offered the opportunity to agree upon a division of the lands among themselves. In the absence of a written agreement, the preference right bidders shall be allowed to continue bidding to determine the high bidder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Where designated bidders fail to exercise the preference consideration offered by the authorized officer in the allowed time, the sale shall proceed using the procedures specified in Sec. 2711.3-1 of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Once the method of modified competitive or noncompetitive sale is determined and such determination has been issued, published and sent in accordance with procedures of this part, payment shall be by the same instruments as authorized in Sec. 2711.3-1(c) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Acceptance or rejection of any offer to purchase shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 2711.3-1 (f) and (g) of this subpart.

Sec. 2711.3-3  Direct sales.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Direct sales (without competition) may be utilized, when in the opinion of the authorized officer, a competitive sale is not appropriate and the public interest would best be served by a direct sale. Examples include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A tract identified for transfer to State or local government or nonprofit organization; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A tract identified for sale that is an integral part of a project or public importance and speculative bidding would jeopardize a timely completion and economic viability of the project; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> There is a need to recognize an authorized use such as an existing business which could suffer a substantial economic loss if the tract were purchased by other than the authorized user; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The adjoining ownership pattern and access indicate a direct sale is appropriate; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A need to resolve inadvertent unauthorized use or occupancy of the lands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Once the authorized officer has determined that the lands will be offered by direct sale and such determination has been issued, published and sent in accordance with procedures of this part, payment shall be made by the same instruments as authorized in Sec. 2711.3-1(c) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Failure to accept an offer to purchase the offered lands within the time specified by the authorized officer shall constitute a waiver of this preference consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Acceptance or rejection of an offer to purchase the lands shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 2711.3-1 (f) and (g) of this subpart.
