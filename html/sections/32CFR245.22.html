Aircraft emergencies and inbound international flights that have reached  the point of no return, including foreign air carrier flights en route  to safe haven airports in accordance with specific international  agreements are examples of such situations. These events must be treated  individually through coordination between ATC and appropriate military  authorities in consideration of the urgency of the in-flight situation  and existing tactical military conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions to EATPL. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DoD aircraft in priorities three  through seven that do not meet EATPL restrictions may request an  exemption from the appropriate military authority. For the contiguous 48  U.S. states, Alaska, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada,  requests shall be submitted to the appropriate NORAD Sector. For Hawaii,  Guam, Wake Island, other U.S. Pacific Territories, and Pacific oceanic  airspace over which FAA has air traffic control jurisdiction by  international agreement, requests shall be submitted to the designated  AADC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For Federal, State, local government agencies and aircraft in  priority eight, a Security Control Authorization may be granted on a  case-by-case basis. Requests for SCAs will be coordinated through TSA.  TSA will forward those requests that it recommends for approval to the  appropriate military authority.
