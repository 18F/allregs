                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Transactions that are covered transactions include, without limitation:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A transaction which, irrespective of the actual arrangements for control provided for in the terms of the transaction, results or could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to purchase all of the shares of Corporation X, which is a U.S. business. As the sole owner, Corporation A will have the right to elect directors and appoint other primary officers of Corporation X, and those directors will have the right to make decisions about the closing and relocation of particular production facilities and the termination of significant contracts. The directors also will have the right to propose to Corporation A, the sole shareholder, the dissolution of Corporation X and the sale of its principal assets. The proposed transaction is a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Same facts as in Example 1, except that Corporation A plans to retain the existing directors of Corporation X, all of whom are U.S. nationals. Although Corporation A may choose not to exercise its power to elect new directors for Corporation X, Corporation A nevertheless will have that exercisable power. The proposed transaction is a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to purchase 50 percent of the shares in Corporation X, a U.S. business, from Corporation B, also a U.S. business. Corporation B would retain the other 50 percent of the shares in Corporation X, and Corporation A and Corporation B would contractually agree that Corporation A would not exercise its voting and other rights for ten years. The proposed transaction is a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A transaction in which a foreign person conveys its control of a U.S. business to another foreign person.</p><p class="depth2">Example. Corporation X is a U.S. business, but is wholly owned and controlled by Corporation Y, a foreign person. Corporation Z, also a foreign person, but not related to Corporation Y, seeks to acquire Corporation X from Corporation Y. The proposed transaction is a covered transaction because it could result in control of Corporation X, a U.S. business, by another foreign person, Corporation Z.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A transaction that results or could result in control by a foreign person of any part of an entity or of assets, if such part of an entity or assets constitutes a U.S. business. (See Sec. 800.302(c).)</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Corporation X, a foreign person, has a branch office located in the United States. Corporation A, a foreign person, proposes to buy that branch office. The proposed transaction is a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Corporation A, a foreign person, buys a branch office located entirely outside the United States of Corporation Y, which is incorporated in the United States. Assuming no other relevant facts, the branch office of Corporation Y is not a U.S. business, and the transaction is not a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Corporation A, a foreign person, makes a start-up, or ``greenfield,'' investment in the United States. That investment involves such activities as separately arranging for the financing of and the construction of a plant to make a new product, buying supplies and inputs, hiring personnel, and purchasing the necessary technology. The investment may involve the acquisition of shares in a newly incorporated subsidiary. Assuming no other relevant facts, Corporation A will not have acquired a U.S. business, and its greenfield investment is not a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Corporation A, a foreign person, purchases substantially all of the assets of Corporation B. Corporation B, which is incorporated in the United States, was in the business of producing industrial equipment, but stopped producing and selling such equipment one week before Corporation A purchased substantially all of its assets. At the time of the transaction, Corporation B continued to have employees on its payroll, maintained know-how in producing the industrial equipment it previously produced, and maintained relationships with its prior customers, all of which were transferred to Corporation A. The acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Corporation B by Corporation A is a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. Corporation A, a foreign person, owns businesses both outside the United States and in the United States. Corporation B, a foreign person, acquires Corporation A. The acquisition of Corporation A by Corporation B is a covered transaction with respect to Corporation A's businesses in the United States.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. Corporation X, a foreign person, seeks to acquire from Corporation A, a U.S. business, an empty warehouse facility located in the United States. The acquisition would be limited to the physical facility, and would not include customer lists, intellectual property, or other proprietary information, or other intangible assets or the transfer of personnel. Assuming no other relevant facts, the facility is not an entity and therefore not a U.S. business, and the proposed acquisition of the facility is not a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. Same facts as Example 6, except that, in addition to the proposed acquisition of Corporation A's warehouse facility, Corporation X would acquire the personnel, customer list, equipment, and inventory management software used to operate the facility. Under these facts, Corporation X is acquiring a U.S. business, and the proposed acquisition is a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A joint venture in which the parties enter into a contractual or other

similar arrangement, including an agreement on the establishment of a new entity, but only if one or more of the parties contributes a U.S. business and a foreign person could control that U.S. business by means of the joint venture.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation X, a U.S. business, form a separate corporation, JV Corporation, to which Corporation A contributes only cash and Corporation X contributes a U.S. business. Each owns 50 percent of the shares of JV Corporation and, under the Articles of Incorporation of JV Corporation, both Corporation A and Corporation X have veto power over all of the matters affecting JV Corporation identified under Sec. 800.204(a)(1) through (10), giving them both control over JV Corporation. The formation of JV Corporation is a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation X, a U.S. business, form a separate corporation, JV Corporation, to which Corporation A contributes funding and managerial and technical personnel, while Corporation X contributes certain land and equipment that do not in this example constitute a U.S. business. Corporations A and B each have a 50 percent interest in the joint venture. Assuming no other relevant facts, the formation of JV Corporation is not a covered transaction.</p>
