                            <p class="depth0">Notwithstanding other provisions of this part, the following provisions apply as specified to locomotives and locomotive engines subject to the provisions of this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Tier 0 standards. In addition to the requirements of Sec. 92.8(a)(1)(i), the following new locomotives and new locomotive engines are subject to the Tier 0 emission standards of Sec. 92.8. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to passenger locomotives. The requirements of this paragraph (a) provide manufacturers of freshly manufactured locomotives two options for compliance. The first option is to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, which has the effect of requiring compliance with Tier 0 standards on average beginning on January 1, 2001 for all freshly manufactured and remanufactured locomotives originally manufactured on or after January 1, 1994. The second option requires compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section that the manufacturer make a remanufacturing system available at a reasonable cost for its primary model for the 1994 through 1997 production period prior to January 1, 2000, and to apply the same emission controls to its new production of similar locomotives. Manufacturers complying with paragraph (a)(3) of this section would be allowed to manufacture and remanufacture other locomotives without a certificate of conformity, prior to January 1, 2002, except as required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. Manufacturers may comply with paragraph (a)(3) of this section through compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Freshly manufactured locomotives.

Manufacturers and remanufacturers may use LSD or ULSD test fuel to certify to the standards of this part, instead of the otherwise specified test fuel, provided PM emissions are corrected as described in this paragraph (i). Measure your PM emissions and determine your cycle-weighted emission rates as specified in subpart B of this part. If you test using LSD, add 0.04 g/bhp-hr to these weighted emission rates to determine your official emission result. If you test using ULSD, add 0.05 g/bhp-hr to these weighted emission rates to determine your official emission result.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Subchapter U provisions. For model years 2008 through 2012, certain locomotives will be subject to the requirements of this part 92 while others will be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR subchapter U. This paragraph (j) describes allowances for manufacturers or remanufacturers to ask for flexibility in transitioning to the new regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may ask to use a combination of the test procedures of this part and those of 40 CFR part 1033. We will approve your request if you show us that it does not affect your ability to show compliance with the applicable emission standards. Generally this requires that the combined procedures would result in emission measurements at least as high as those that would be measured using the procedures specified in this part. Alternatively, you may demonstrate that the combined effects of the procedures is small relative to your compliance margin (the degree to which your locomotives are below the applicable standards).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may ask to comply with the administrative requirements of 40 CFR part 1033 and 1068 instead of the equivalent requirements of this part.
