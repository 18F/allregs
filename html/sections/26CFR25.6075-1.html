                                Sec. 25.6075-1  Returns, time for filing gift tax returns for gifts made
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of  this section, a return required to be filed under section 6019 for gifts  made after December 31, 1981, must be filed on or before the 15th day of  April following the close of the calendar year in which the gift was  made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Extensions. Except as provided in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section, if a taxpayer files an income tax return on the  calendar year basis and the taxpayer is granted an extension of time for  filing the return of income tax imposed by Subtitle A of the Internal  Revenue Code, then such taxpayer shall also be deemed to have been  granted an extension of time for filing the gift tax return under  section 6019 for such calendar year equal to the extension of time  granted for filing the income tax return. See section 6081 and the  regulations thereunder for rules relating to extension of time for  filing returns.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Death of donor. Where a gift is made during the calendar year in  which the donor dies, the time for filing the return made under section  6019 shall not be later than the time (including extensions) for filing  the return made under section 6018 (relating to estate tax returns) with  respect to such donor. In addition, should the time for filing the  estate tax return fall later than the 15th day of April following the  close of the calendar year, the time for filing the gift tax return  shall be on or before the 15th day of April following the close of the  calendar year, unless an extension (not extending beyond the time for  filing the estate tax return) was granted for filing the gift tax  return. If no estate tax return is required to be filed, the time for  filing the gift tax return shall be on or before the 15th day of April  following the close of the calendar year, unless an extension was  granted for filing the gift tax return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Paragraphs (a) and (b) may be illustrated by the following  examples.</p><p class="depth2">Example (1). Donor makes a taxable gift on April 1, 1982, for which  a return must be made under section 6019. Donor files the income tax  return on the calendar year basis. The donor was granted a 4-month  extension from April 15, 1983 to August 15, 1983, in which to file the  1982 income tax return. Under these circumstances, the donor is not  required to file the gift tax return prior to August 15, 1983. See  paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2). Donor makes a taxable gift on April 1, 1982, for which  a return must be made under section 6019. The donor dies on May 1, 1982.  Under these circumstances, since the due date for filing the estate tax  return, February 1, 1983 (assuming an estate tax return under section  6018 was required to be filed), falls prior to the due date for the gift  tax return (as specified in section 6075(b)(1)), the last day for filing  the gift tax return is February 1, 1983. See paragraph (b)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2">Example (3). The facts are the same as in example (2), except the  donor dies on November 30, 1982. Although the estate tax return is due  on or before August 30, 1983, the last day for filing the gift tax  return is April 15, 1983. See paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example (4). The facts are the same as in example (3), except that  the executor receives a 4-month extension for filing the decedent's  income tax return. Under these circumstances, the last day for filing  the gift tax return is August 15, 1983. See paragraphs (b) (1) and (2)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example (5). The facts are the same as in example (3), except that  the donor-decedent receives an extension of 6 months for filing the gift  tax return. See section 6081 and Sec. 25.6081-1. Since section  6075(b)(3) and Sec. 25.6075-2(b) provide that the time for filing the  gift tax return made under section 6019 shall not be later than the time  (including extensions) for filing the estate tax return made under  section 6018, the last day for filing the gift tax return is August 30,  1983.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> See section 7503 and Sec. 301.7503-1 concerning the timely  filing of a return that falls due on a Saturday, Sunday or legal  holiday. As to additions to the tax for failure to file the return  within the prescribed time, see section 6651 and Sec. 301.6651-1.  [T.D. 7910, 48 FR 40375, Sept. 7, 1983]</p>
