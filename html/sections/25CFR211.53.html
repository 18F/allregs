                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approved leases or any interest therein may be assigned or  transferred only with the approval of the Secretary. The Indian mineral  owner must also consent if approval of the Indian mineral owner is  required in the lease. If consent is not required, then the Secretary  shall notify the Indian mineral owner of the proposed assignment. To  obtain the approval of the Secretary the assignee must be qualified to  hold the lease under existing rules and regulations and shall furnish a  satisfactory bond conditioned for the   faithful performance of the covenants and conditions of the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No lease or interest therein or the use of such lease shall be  assigned, sublet, or transferred, directly or indirectly, by working or  drilling contract, or otherwise, without the consent of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assignments of leases, and stipulations modifying the provisions  of existing leases, which stipulations are also subject to the approval  of the Secretary, shall be filed with the superintendent within five (5)  working days after the date of execution. Upon execution of satisfactory  bonds by the assignee the Secretary may permit the release of any bonds  executed by the assignor. Upon execution of satisfactory bonds the  assignee accepts all the assignor's responsibilities and prior  obligations and liabilities of the assignor (including but not limited  to any underpaid royalties and rentals) under the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of  production shall not be considered as interests in the leases as such  provision is used in this section. Agreements creating overriding  royalties or payments out of production, or agreements designating  operators are hereby authorized and the approval of the Secretary shall  not be required with respect thereto, but such agreements shall be  subject to the condition that nothing in such agreements shall be  construed as modifying any of the obligations of the lessee, including,  but not limited to, obligations imposed by requirements of the MMS for  reporting, accounting, and auditing; obligations for diligent  development and operation, protection against drainage and mining in  trespass, compliance with oil and gas, geothermal, and mining  regulations (25 CFR part 216; 43 CFR parts 3160, 3260, 3480, and 3590;  and those applicable rules found in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and  C) and the requirements for Secretarial approval before abandonment of  any oil and gas or geothermal well or mining operation. All such  obligations are to remain in full force and effect, the same as if free  of any such overriding royalties or payments. The existence of  agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production,  whether or not actually paid, shall not be considered as justification  for the approval of abandonment of any oil and gas or geothermal well or  mining operation. Nothing in this paragraph revokes the requirement for  approval of assignments and other instruments which is required in this  section, but any overriding royalties or payments out of production  created by the provisions of such assignments or instruments shall be  subject to the condition stated in this section. Agreements creating  overriding royalties or payments out of production, or agreements  designating operators shall be filed with the superintendent unless  incorporated in assignments or instruments required to be filed pursuant  to this section.</p>
