                                Sec. 393.124  What are the rules for securing concrete pipe?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. (1) The rules in this section apply to the transportation of concrete pipe on flatbed trailers and vehicles, and lowboy trailers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Concrete pipe bundled tightly together into a single rigid article that has no tendency to roll, and concrete pipe loaded in a sided vehicle or container must be secured in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 393.100 through 393.114.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General specifications for tiedowns. (1) The aggregate working load limit of all tiedowns on any group of pipes must not be less than half the total weight of all the pipes in the group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A transverse tiedown through a pipe on an upper tier or over longitudinal tiedowns is considered to secure all those pipes beneath on which that tiedown causes pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Blocking. (1) Blocking may be one or more pieces placed symmetrically about the center of a pipe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> One piece must extend at least half the distance from the center to each end of the pipe, and two pieces must be placed on the opposite side, one at each end of the pipe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Blocking must be placed firmly against the pipe, and must be secured to prevent it moving out from under the pipe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Timber blocking must have minimum dimensions of at least 10 x 15 cm (4 x 6 in).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Arranging the load--(1) Pipe of different diameter. If pipe of more than one diameter are loaded on a vehicle, groups must be formed that consist of pipe of only one size, and each group must be separately secured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Arranging a bottom tier. The bottom tier must be arranged to cover the full length of the vehicle, or as a partial tier in one group or two groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Arranging an upper tier. Pipe must be placed only in the wells formed by adjacent pipes in the tier beneath. A third or higher tier must not be started unless all wells in the tier beneath are filled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Arranging the top tier. The top tier must be arranged as a complete tier, a partial tier in one group, or a partial tier in two groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Arranging bell pipe. (i) Bell pipe must be loaded on at least two longitudinal spacers of sufficient height to ensure that the bell is clear of the deck.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Bell pipe loaded in one tier must have the bells alternating on opposite sides of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The ends of consecutive pipe must be staggered, if possible, within the allowable width, otherwise they must be aligned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Bell pipe loaded in more than one tier must have the bells of the bottom tier all on the same side of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Pipe in every upper tier must be loaded with bells on the opposite side of the vehicle to the bells of the tier below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If the second tier is not complete, pipe in the bottom tier which do not support a pipe above must have their bells alternating on opposite sides of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Securing pipe with an inside diameter up to 1,143 mm (45 in). In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the following rules must be satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Stabilizing the bottom tier. (i) The bottom tier must be immobilized longitudinally at each end by blocking, vehicle end structure, stakes, a locked pipe unloader, or other equivalent means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other pipe in the bottom tier may also be held in place by blocks and/or wedges; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Every pipe in the bottom tier must also be held firmly in contact with the adjacent pipe by tiedowns though the front and rear pipes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At least one tiedown through the front pipe of the bottom tier must run aft at an angle not more than 45 degrees with the horizontal, whenever practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> At least one tiedown through the rear pipe of the bottom tier must run forward at an angle not more than 45 degrees with the horizontal, whenever practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use of tiedowns. (i) Each pipe may be secured individually with tiedowns through the pipe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If each pipe is not secured individually with a tiedown, then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Either one 1/2-inch diameter chain or wire rope, or two 3/8-inch diameter chain or wire rope, must be placed longitudinally over the group of pipes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> One transverse tiedown must be used for every 3.04 m (10 ft) of load length. The transverse tiedowns may be placed through a pipe, or over both longitudinal tiedowns between two pipes on the top tier;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the first pipe of a group in the top tier is not placed in the first well formed by pipes at the front of the tier beneath, it must be secured by an additional tiedown that runs rearward at an angle not more than 45 degrees to the horizontal, whenever practicable. This tiedown must pass either through the front pipe of the upper tier, or outside it and over both longitudinal tiedowns; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the last pipe of a group in the top tier is not placed in the last well formed by pipes at the rear of the tier beneath, it must be secured by an additional tiedown that runs forward at an angle not more than 45 degrees to the horizontal, whenever practicable. This tiedown must pass either through the rear pipe of the upper tier or outside it and over both longitudinal tiedowns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Securing large pipe, with an inside diameter over 1143 mm (45 in). In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the following rules must be satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The front pipe and the rear pipe must be immobilized by blocking, wedges, vehicle end structure, stakes, locked pipe unloader, or other equivalent means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each pipe must be secured by tiedowns through the pipe:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At least one tiedown through each pipe in the front half of the load, which includes the middle one if there is an odd number, and must run rearward at an angle not more than 45 degrees with the horizontal, whenever practicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At least one tiedown through each pipe in the rear half of the load, and must run forward at an angle not more than 45 degrees with the horizontal, whenever practicable, to hold each pipe firmly in contact with adjacent pipe; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the front or rear pipe is not also in contact with vehicle end structure, stakes, a locked pipe unloader, or other equivalent means, at least two tiedowns positioned as described in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, must be used through that pipe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If only one pipe is transported, or if several pipes are transported without contact between other pipes, the requirements in this paragraph apply to each pipe as a single front and rear article.
