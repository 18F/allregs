In the case of boats going in the same direction the boat which is in the canal shall not answer the signal of the boat desiring to enter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Passing. Steamers shall not under any circumstances attempt to pass each other in the canal, either when going in the same or opposite directions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Anchoring.

Two red lights, one vertically above the other, displayed ahead of a vessel, shall indicate that the waterway is not clear.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A vessel approaching the narrow section and drawbridges from either end of the waterway shall give one long blast of a whistle and shall not enter the narrow section until green lights are displayed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> One vessel may follow another vessel in either direction, but the channel shall not be kept open in the same direction for an unreasonable time if a vessel is waiting at the other end.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Tugs, launches, and small craft shall keep close to one side of the channel when vessels or boats with tows are passing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All craft shall proceed with caution. The display of a green light is not a guarantee that the channel is clear of traffic, and neither the United States nor the City of Seattle will be responsible for any damage to vessels or other property which may be chargeable to mistakes in the operation of the signal lights or to their failure to operate.</p><p class="depth3">Note: The Corps of Engineers also has regulations dealing with this section in 33 CFR Part 207.
