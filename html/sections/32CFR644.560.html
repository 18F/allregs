                            <p class="depth0">The DE, within whose areas of military real estate operations are  located the facilities conveyed under the authority mentioned in Sec.  644.559, will make physical inspections thereof for the purpose of  determining compliance with the terms of the conveyance. Any evidence of  noncompliance should be reported to DAEN-REM in order that appropriate  recommendations may be made to the respective Secretary for corrective  action. A detailed statement of the facts and recommendations of the DE  should be included in the report. Inspections should be scheduled and  integrated with outlease compliance inspection itineraries in the  interest of economy. This requirement for inspections extends to  properties conveyed by the Secretary of the Army or Air Force under  special legislation, where the deed of conveyance imposes conditions on  future use of the land. These inspections need not be made annually but  frequently enough so that the DE is assured that the conditions are  being observed, and at least every three years. Compliance with  conditions in deeds for property conveyed for airport purposes under 49  U.S.C. 1723 and 50 App. U.S.C. 1622g is the responsibility of the  Secretary of Transportation; for property conveyed for purposes of  health and education, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare or  its successor agencies (40 U.S.C. 484(k)(4)). The Commander, U.S. Army  Materiel Development and Readiness Command, is responsible for  compliance with the National Security Clause, and similar conditions, in  deeds conveying industrial properties.</p>
