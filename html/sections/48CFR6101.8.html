                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How motions are made. Motions may be oral or written. A written motion shall state the relief sought and, either in the text of the motion or in an accompanying legal memorandum, the grounds therefor. In addition, a motion for summary relief shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section. Section 6101.23 (Rule 23) prescribes the form and content of legal memoranda. Oral motions shall be made on the record and in the presence of the other party. Except for joint motions by the parties, all motions must represent that the moving party has attempted to discuss the grounds for the motion with the non-moving party and tried to resolve the matter informally.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When motions may be made. A motion filed in lieu of an answer pursuant to 6101.6(c) (Rule 6(c)) shall be filed no later than the date on which the answer is required to be filed or such later date as may be established by the Board. Any other dispositive motion shall be made as soon as practicable after the grounds therefor are known. Any other motion shall be made promptly or as required by the rules of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dispositive motions. The following dispositive motions may properly be made before the Board:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction or for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Motions to dismiss for failure to prosecute;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Motions for summary relief (analogous to summary judgment); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other motion to dismiss.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other motions. Other motions may be made in good faith and in proper form. When filing a motion for an enlargement of time, the moving party shall state that it has contacted the

opposing party about the request and shall inform the Board whether the opposing party consents to the request or will file an opposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Jurisdictional questions. The Board may at any time consider the issue of its jurisdiction to decide a case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Procedure. Unless otherwise directed by the Board, a party may respond to a written motion other than a motion pursuant to 6101.26, 6101.27, 6101.28, or 6101.29 (Rules 26, 27, 28, or 29) at any time within 20 calendar days after the filing of the motion. Responses to motions pursuant to 6101.26, 6101.27, 6101.28, or 6101.29 (Rules 26, 27, 28, or 29) may be made only as permitted or directed by the Board. The Board may permit hearing or oral argument on written motions and may require additional submissions from any of the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Motions for summary relief. (1) A motion for summary relief should be filed only when a party believes that, based upon uncontested material facts, it is entitled to relief in whole or in part as a matter of law. A motion for summary relief should be filed as soon as feasible, to allow the Board to rule on the motion in advance of a scheduled hearing date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A motion for summary relief should be filed only when a party believes that, based upon uncontested material facts, it is entitled to relief in whole or in part as a matter of law. A motion for summary relief should be filed as soon as feasible, to allow the Board to rule on the motion in advance of a scheduled hearing date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With each motion for summary relief, there shall be served and filed a separate document titled Statement of Uncontested Facts, which shall contain in separately numbered paragraphs all of the material facts upon which the moving party bases its motion and as to which it contends there is no genuine issue. This statement shall include references to the supporting affidavits or declarations and documents, if any, and to the 6101.4 (Rule 4) appeal file exhibits relied upon to support such statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An opposing party shall file with its opposition (or cross-motion) a separate document titled Statement of Genuine Issues. This document shall identify, by reference to specific paragraph numbers in the moving party's Statement of Uncontested Facts, those facts as to which the opposing party claims there is a genuine issue necessary to be litigated. An opposing party shall state the precise nature of its disagreement and give its version of the facts. This statement shall include references to the supporting affidavits or declarations and documents, if any, and to the 6101.4 (Rule 4) appeal file exhibits that demonstrate the existence of a genuine dispute. An opposing party may also file a Statement of Uncontested Facts as to any relevant matters not covered by the moving party's statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a motion for summary relief is made and supported as provided in 6101.8 (Rule 8), an opposing party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings. The opposing party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided by 6101.8 (Rule 8), must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact. If the opposing party does not so respond, summary relief, if appropriate, shall be entered against that party. For good cause shown, if an opposing party cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the Board may defer ruling on the motion to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or other discovery to be conducted, or may make such other order as is just.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Effect of pending motion. Except as the rules of this chpater provide or the Board may order, a pending motion shall not excuse the parties from proceeding with the case in accordance with the rules of this chapter and the orders and directions of the Board.
