                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Classification of an action for national defense or foreign  policy purposes does not relieve the requirement of complying with NEPA.  In classified matters, the Air Force must prepare and make available  normal NEPA environmental analysis documents to aid in the decision- making process; however, Air Force staff must prepare, safeguard, and  disseminate these documents according to established procedures for  protecting classified documents. If an EIAP document must be classified,  the Air Force may modify or eliminate associated requirements for public  notice (including publication in the Federal Register) or public  involvement in the EIAP. However, the Air Force should obtain comments  on classified proposed actions or classified aspects of generally  unclassified actions, from public agencies having jurisdiction by law or  special expertise, to the extent that such review and comment is  consistent with security requirements. Where feasible, the EPF may need  to help appropriate personnel from those agencies obtain necessary  security clearances to gain access to documents so they can comment on  scoping or review the documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the proposed action is classified and unavailable to the  public, the Air Force may keep the entire NEPA process classified and  protected under the applicable procedures for the classification level  pertinent to the particular information. At times (for example, during  weapons system development and base closures and realignments), certain  but not all aspects of NEPA documents may later be declassified. In  those cases, the EPF should organize the EIAP documents, to the extent  practicable, in a way that keeps the most sensitive classified  information (which is not expected to be released at any early date) in  a separate annex that can remain classified; the rest of the EIAP  documents, when declassified, will then be comprehensible as a unit and  suitable for release to the public. Thus, the documents will reflect, as  much as possible, the nature of the action and its environmental  impacts, as well as Air Force compliance with NEPA requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the proposed action is not classified, but certain aspects  of it need to be protected by security classification, the EPF should  tailor the EIAP for a proposed action to permit as normal a level of  public involvement as possible, but also fully protect the classified  part of the action and environmental analysis. In some instances, the  EPF can do this by keeping the classified sections of the EIAP documents  in a separate, classified annex.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For Sec. 989.26(b) actions, an NOI or NOA will not be published  in the Federal Register until the proposed action is declassified. For  Sec. 989.26(c) actions, the Federal Register will run an unclassified  NOA which will advise   the public that at some time in the future the Air Force may or will  publicly release a declassified document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The EPF similarly protects classified aspects of FONSIs, RODs,  or other environmental documents that are part of the EIAP for a  proposed action, such as by preparing separate classified annexes to  unclassified documents, as necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Whenever a proponent believes that EIAP documents should be kept  classified, the EPF must make a report of the matter to SAF/IEI,  including proposed modifications of the normal EIAP to protect  classified information. The EPF may make such submissions at whatever  level of security classification is needed to provide a comprehensive  understanding of the issues. SAF/IEI, with support from SAF/GC and other  staff elements as necessary, makes final decisions on EIAP procedures  for classified actions.
