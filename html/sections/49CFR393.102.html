Tiedown assemblies (including chains, wire rope, steel strapping, synthetic webbing, and cordage) and other attachment or fastening devices used to secure articles of cargo to, or in, commercial motor vehicles must be designed, installed, and maintained to ensure that the maximum forces acting on the devices or systems do not exceed the manufacturer's breaking strength rating under the following conditions, applied separately:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Breaking strength.

Tiedown assemblies (including chains, wire rope, steel strapping, synthetic webbing, and cordage) and other attachment or fastening devices used to secure articles of cargo to, or in, commercial motor vehicles must be designed, installed, and maintained to ensure that the forces acting on the devices or systems do not exceed the working load limit for the devices under the following conditions, applied separately:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 0.435 g deceleration in the forward direction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 0.5 g acceleration in the rearward direction; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 0.25 g acceleration in a lateral direction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Performance criteria for devices to prevent vertical movement of loads that are not contained within the structure of the vehicle. Securement systems must provide a downward force equivalent to at least 20 percent of the weight of the article of cargo if the article is not fully contained within the structure of the vehicle. If the article is fully contained within the structure of the vehicle, it may be secured in accordance with Sec. 393.106(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Equivalent means of securement. The means of securing articles of cargo are considered to meet the performance requirements of this section if the cargo is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Immobilized, such so that it cannot shift or tip to the extent that the vehicle's stability or maneuverability is adversely affected; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transported in a sided vehicle that has walls of adequate strength, such that each article of cargo within the vehicle is in contact with, or sufficiently close to a wall or other articles, so that it cannot shift or tip to the extent that the vehicle's stability or maneuverability is adversely affected; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Secured in accordance with the applicable requirements of Sec. Sec. 393.104 through 393.136.
