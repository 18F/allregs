                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To which meters do BSEE requirements for gas measurement apply?  BSEE requirements for gas measurements apply to all OCS gas royalty and  allocation meters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> What are the requirements for measuring gas? You must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Design, install, use, maintain, and test measurement equipment  and procedures to ensure accurate and verifiable measurement. You must  follow the recommendations in API MPMS or RP and AGA as incorporated by  reference in 30 CFR 250.198, including the following additional  editions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> API RP 86 (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec.   250.198);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> AGA Report No. 7 (incorporated by reference as specified in  Sec.  250.198);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> AGA Report No. 9 (incorporated by reference as specified in  Sec.  250.198);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> AGA Report No. 10 (incorporated by reference as specified in  Sec.  250.198);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ensure that the measurement components demonstrate consistent  levels of accuracy throughout the system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Equip the meter with a chart or electronic data recorder. If an  electronic data recorder is used, you must follow the recommendations in  API MPMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Take proportional-to-flow or spot samples upstream or downstream  of the meter at least once every 6 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> When requested by the Regional Supervisor, provide available  information on the gas quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Ensure that standard conditions for reporting gross heating  value (Btu) are at a base temperature of 60 [deg]F and at a base  pressure of 14.73 psia and reflect the same degree of water saturation  as in the gas volume.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> When requested by the Regional Supervisor, submit copies of gas  volume statements for each requested gas meter. Show whether gas volumes  and   gross Btu heating values are reported at saturated or unsaturated  conditions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> When requested by the Regional Supervisor, provide volume and  quality statements on dispositions other than those on the gas volume  statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> What are the requirements for gas meter calibrations? You must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Verify/calibrate operating meters monthly, but do not exceed 42  days between verifications/calibrations. When a force majeure event  precludes the required monthly meter verification/calibration, meters  must be verified/calibrated within 15 days after being returned to  service. The meters must be verified/calibrated monthly thereafter, but  do not exceed 42 days between meter verifications/calibrations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calibrate each meter by using the manufacturer's specifications;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Conduct calibrations as close as possible to the average hourly  rate of flow since the last calibration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Retain calibration reports at the field location for 2 years,  and send the reports to the Regional Supervisor upon request; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Permit BSEE representatives to witness calibrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> What must I do if a gas meter is out of calibration or  malfunctioning? If a gas meter is out of calibration or malfunctioning,  you must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the readings are greater than the contractual tolerances,  adjust the meter to function properly or remove it from service and  replace it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Correct the volumes to the last acceptable calibration as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the duration of the error can be determined, calculate the  volume adjustment for that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the duration of the error cannot be determined, apply the  volume adjustment to one-half of the time elapsed since the last  calibration or 21 days, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> What are the requirements when natural gas from a Federal lease  on the OCS is transferred to a gas plant before royalty determination?  If natural gas from a Federal lease on the OCS is transferred to a gas  plant before royalty determination:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You must provide the following to the Regional Supervisor upon  request:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A copy of the monthly gas processing plant allocation statement;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Gross heating values of the inlet and residue streams when not  reported on the gas plant statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You must permit BSEE to inspect the measurement and sampling  equipment of natural gas processing plants that process Federal  production.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> What are the requirements for measuring gas lost or used on a  lease? (1) You must either measure or estimate the volume of gas lost or  used on a lease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you measure the volume, document the measurement equipment  used and include the volume measured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you estimate the volume, document the estimating method, the  data used, and the volumes estimated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> You must keep the documentation, including the volume data,  easily obtainable for inspection at the field location for at least 2  years, and must retain the documentation at a location of your choosing  for at least 7 years after the documentation is generated, subject to  all other document retention and production requirements in 30 U.S.C.  1713 and 30 CFR part 1212.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Upon the request of the Regional Supervisor, you must provide  copies of the records.
