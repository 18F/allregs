If the</p><p class="depth0">decelerations set forth in column 3 are divided by 32.2 feet per-second per-second, the figures in column 2</p><p class="depth0">will be obtained. (For example, 21 divided by 32.2 equals 65.2 percent.) Column 2 is included in the</p><p class="depth0">tabulation because certain brake testing devices utilize this factor.(b) The decelerations specified in column 3 are an indication of the effectiveness of the basic brakes, and as</p><p class="depth0">measured in practical brake testing are the maximum decelerations attained at some time during the stop. These</p><p class="depth0">decelerations as measured in brake tests cannot be used to compute the values in column 4 because the</p><p class="depth0">deceleration is not sustained at the same rate over the entire period of the stop. The deceleration increases</p><p class="depth0">from zero to a maximum during a period of brake system application and brake-force buildup. Also, other</p><p class="depth0">factors may cause the deceleration to decrease after reaching a maximum. The added distance that results</p><p class="depth0">because maximum deceleration is not sustained is included in the figures in column 4 but is not indicated by</p><p class="depth0">the usual brake-testing devices for checking deceleration.(c) The distances in column 4 and the decelerations in column 3 are not directly related. ``Brake-system</p><p class="depth0">application and braking distance in feet'' (column 4) is a definite measure of the overall effectiveness of</p><p class="depth0">the braking system, being the distance traveled between the point at which the driver starts to move the</p><p class="depth0">braking controls and the point at which the vehicle comes to rest. It includes distance traveled while the</p><p class="depth0">brakes are being applied and distance traveled while the brakes are retarding the vehicle.(d) The distance traveled during the period of brake-system application and brake-force buildup varies with</p><p class="depth0">vehicle type, being negligible for many passenger cars and greatest for combinations of commercial vehicles.</p><p class="depth0">This fact accounts for the variation from 20 to 40 feet in the values in column 4 for the various classes of</p><p class="depth0">vehicles.(e) The terms ``GVWR'' and ``GVW'' refer to the manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating and the actual gross</p><p class="depth0">vehicle weight, respectively.
