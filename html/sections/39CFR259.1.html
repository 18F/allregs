                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy. The Postal Service cooperates with Federal Agencies  whenever the overall costs to Government will be reduced. Assistance in  a number of special projects and programs is provided when the knowledge  and abilities of postal employees are helpful.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reimbursement. The Postal Service establishes reasonable fees  and charges for nonpostal services performed for agencies of the Federal  as well as State governments. In establishing such fees and charges, the  Postal Service considers the value of time of the personnel directly  involved in the performance of the service, including direct supervision  and supporting functions, plus the cost of materials and supplies  specifically sold, used or consumed. Also included is an element  representing a reasonable share of Postal Service general overhead costs  which are not attributable or assignable specifically to any product or  service. The establishment of such fees and charges shall be reasonably  consistent with the methods employed in establishing rates and fees for  postal services then in effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section,  arrangements for Postal Service participation in special surveys,  censuses, and other activities must be made between the national  headquarters of the requesting agencies and the Customer Services  Department, U.S. Postal Service, Washington, DC 20260. Refer all  requests to the Regional Postmaster General for forwarding to  Headquarters. Authority to perform services for Government agencies is  announced in the Postal Bulletin or by individual letters to the offices  involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Housing Vacancy Surveys--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. An interagency agreement  between the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and the Federal Home Loan Bank  Board (FHLBB) establishes the terms and conditions and reimbursement  rates under which USPS will conduct Housing Vacancy Surveys in City  Delivery offices when requested by FHLBB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Restrictions. The Agreement only authorizes the disclosure of  aggregate statistical data. Postal managers must not permit the name or  address of any   past or present postal patron, or any other person to be disclosed  unless such disclosure is authorized in writing by USPS Regions or  Headquarters and is not in violation of 39 U.S.C. 412.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Postmaster's Responsibility. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A postmaster will receive  notification from FHLBB when his office has been selected to conduct a  Housing Vacancy Survey. Normally, written notification will be mailed to  the postmaster 30 days in advance of the date FHLBB would like USPS to  conduct the survey, since USPS is under no obligation to use overtime or  auxiliary assistance to conduct these surveys. The postmaster or his  designee will schedule the survey on or near the date requested and will  promptly reply to FHLBB so that the necessary forms will be provided on  time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All necessary forms and instructions will be supplied directly  to each post office to be surveyed. Postmasters will designate a manager  in each delivery unit to coordinate the survey within the unit and to  review completed survey forms for accuracy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> FHLBB may request USPS to perform special or emergency surveys  with less than 30 days advance notice. Since FHLBB has agreed to  reimburse USPS at twice the normal rates for promptly performing such  surveys, every reasonable effort should be made to accommodate such  requests in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Housing Vacancy Surveys will not be conducted during the month  of December of any year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Postmasters will notify the Office of Delivery and Collection,  Washington, DC 20260, of the number of each type survey form completed  for FHLBB. FHLBB will then remit payment directly to Headquarters, USPS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> USPS will not release or publish any survey results except in  response to a court order, subpoena, or as required by the Freedom of  Information Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unauthorized projects prohibited. Do not conduct special surveys  or otherwise participate in any cooperative projects without the  authorization in paragraph (c) of this section.
