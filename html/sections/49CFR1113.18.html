                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When filed. In a proceeding which has been the subject of oral  hearing, and in which briefs are to be filed, that fact will be stated  by the officer on the record. The officer shall fix the time for filing  briefs. Simultaneous filing will normally be required, and reply briefs  will not normally be permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evidence abstract. A brief filed after a hearing may contain an  abstract of the evidence relied upon by the party filing it, preferably  assembled by subjects, with reference to the pages of the record, if  written, or exhibit where the evidence appears. In the event the party  elects not to include a separate abstract in his brief, he should give  specific reference to the portions of the record, whether transcript or  otherwise, relied upon in support of the respective statements of fact  made throughout the brief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requested findings. Each brief should include such requests for  specific findings, separately stated and numbered, as the party desires  the Board to make.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exhibit reproduction. Exhibits should not be reproduced in the  brief, but may be shown, within reasonable limits, in an appendix to the  brief. Analysis of such exhibits should be included in the brief where  pertinent.
