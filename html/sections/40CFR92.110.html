The temperature of the  chamber (or room) in which the particulate filters are conditioned and  weighed shall be maintained at a measured temperature between 19 C and  25 C during all filter conditioning and weighing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Humidity. The relative humidity of the chamber (or room) in  which the particulate filters are conditioned and weighed shall be 45[8  percent during all filter conditioning and weighing. The dew point shall  be 6.4 to 12.4 C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Weighing balance specifications. The microbalance used to  determine the weights of all filters shall have a precision (standard  deviation) of no more than 20 micrograms and readability down to 10  micrograms or lower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reference filters. The chamber (or room) environment shall be  free of any ambient contaminants (such as dust) that would settle on the  particulate filters during their stabilization. It is required that at  least two unused reference filters remain in the weighing room at all  times in covered (to reduce dust contamination) but unsealed (to permit  humidity exchange) petri dishes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> These reference filters shall be placed in the same general area  as the sample filters. These reference filters shall be weighed within 4  hours of, but preferably at the same time as, the sample filter  weighings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the average weight of the reference filters changes between  sample filter weighings by [5.0 percent ([7.5 if the filters are weighed  in pairs) or more of the target nominal filter loading (the recommended  nominal loading is 0.5 milligrams per 1075 square millimeters of stain  area), then all sample filters in the process of stabilization shall be  discarded and the emissions tests repeated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the average weight of the reference filters decreases between  sample filter weighings by more than 1.0 percent but less than 5.0  percent of the nominal filter loading then the manufacturer or  remanufacturer has the option of either repeating the emissions test or  adding the average amount of weight loss to the net weight of the  sample.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the average weight of the reference filters increases between  sample filter weighing by more than 1.0 percent but less than 5.0  percent of the nominal filter loading, then the manufacturer or  remanufacturer has the option of either repeating the emissions test or  accepting the measured sample filter weight values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the average weight of the reference filters changes between  sample filter weighings by not more than [1.0 percent, then the measured  sample filter weights shall be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The reference filters shall be changed at least once a month,  but never between clean and used weighings of a given sample filter.  More than one set of reference filters may be used. The reference  filters shall be the same size and material as the sample filters.</p>
