                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Private elementary and private secondary schools, public high  schools, post-secondary schools, language schools, and vocational  schools are eligible for preliminary enrollment in Student and Exchange  Visitor Information System (SEVIS), beginning on or after July 1, 2002,  but only if the school is accredited by an accrediting agency recognized  by the United States Department of Education, CAPE, or AACS, or in the  case of a public high school, the school provides certification from the  appropriate public official that the school meets the requirements of  the state or local public educational system and has been continuously  approved by the Service for a minimum of three years, as of July 1,  2002, for the admission of F or M nonimmigrant students. A school may  establish that it is accredited by showing that it has been designated  as an eligible school under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of  1965.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preliminary enrollment in SEVIS is optional for eligible  schools. The preliminary enrollment period will be open from July 1,  2002, through August 16, 2002, or, if later, until the Service begins  the SEVIS full scale certification process. The process for eligible  schools to apply for preliminary enrollment through the Internet is as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligible institutions must access the Internet site, http:// www.ins.usdoj.gov/sevis. Upon accessing the site, the president, owner,  head of the school or designated school official will be asked to enter  the following information: the school's name; the first, middle, and  last name of the contact person for the school; and the e-mail address  and phone number of the contact person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Once this information has been submitted, the Service will issue  the school a temporary ID and password, which will be forwarded to the  e-mail address listed. When the contact person receives this temporary  ID and password, the school will again access the Internet site and will  electronically enter the school's information for its Form I-17.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Service will review the information by a school submitted as  provided in paragraph (b) of this section, and will preliminarily enroll  a school in SEVIS, if it is determined to be eligible under the  standards of paragraph (a) of this section. If the officer determines  that the school is eligible for preliminary enrollment, the officer will  update SEVIS and enroll the school and permanent user IDs and passwords  will be automatically generated via e-mail to the DSOs listed on the  Form I-17. Schools that are not approved by the Service for preliminary  enrollment will be notified that they must apply for certification in  accordance with the Interim Certification Rule. A school that is granted  preliminary enrollment will have to use SEVIS for the issuance of any  new Form I-20 to a new or continuing student.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Schools granted preliminary enrollment in SEVIS will not have to  apply for certification at this time. However, all such schools will be  required to apply for certification, and pay the certification fee,  prior to May 14, 2004.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Eligible schools that meet the standards of paragraph (a) of  this section, but do not apply for preliminary enrollment in SEVIS prior  to the close of the preliminary enrollment period will have to apply for  certification review under the Interim Certification Rule and pay the  certification fee before enrolling in SEVIS. However, once a school  meeting the standards of paragraph (a) of this section applies for  certification review, the Service will have   the discretion, after a review of the school's application, to allow the  school to enroll in SEVIS without requiring an on-site visit prior to  enrollment. If the Service permits such a school to enroll in SEVIS  prior to completion of the on-site visit, the on-site visit must be  completed prior to May 14, 2004.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Schools that are not eligible to apply for preliminary  enrollment in SEVIS under this section--including flight schools--will  have to apply for certification under the Interim Certification Rule,  pay the certification fee, and undergo a full certification review  including an on-site visit, prior to being allowed to enroll in SEVIS.
