                            <p class="depth0">S1. Scope. This standard specifies requirements for the integrity of motor vehicle fuel systems.</p><p class="depth0">S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce deaths and injuries occurring from fires that result from fuel spillage during and after motor vehicle crashes, and resulting from ingestion of fuels during siphoning.</p><p class="depth0">S3. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars, and to multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks and buses that have a GVWR of 4,536 kg or less and use fuel with a boiling point above 0 [deg]C, and to school buses that have a GVWR greater than 4,536 kg and use fuel with a boiling point above 0 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">S4. Definition. Fuel spillage means the fall, flow, or run of fuel from the vehicle but does not include wetness resulting from capillary action.</p><p class="depth0">S5. General requirements.</p><p class="depth0">S5.1 Passenger cars, and multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less. Each passenger car and each multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, and bus with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less shall meet the requirements of S6.1 through S6.4. Each of these types of vehicles that is manufactured to use alcohol fuels shall also meet the requirements of S6.6.</p><p class="depth0">S5.2 [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">S5.3 [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">S5.4 Schoolbuses with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds. Each schoolbus with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds shall meet the requirements of S6.5. Each schoolbus with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds that is manufactured to use alcohol fuels shall meet the requirements of S6.6.</p><p class="depth0">S5.5 Fuel spillage; Barrier crash. Fuel spillage in any fixed or moving barrier crash test shall not exceed 28 g from impact until motion of the vehicle has ceased, and shall not exceed a total of 142 g in the 5-minute period following

cessation of motion. For the subsequent 25-minute period, fuel spillage during any 1 minute interval shall not exceed 28 g.</p><p class="depth0">S5.6 Fuel spillage; rollover. Fuel spillage in any rollover test, from the onset of rotational motion, shall not exceed a total of 142 g for the first 5 minutes of testing at each successive 90[deg] increment. For the remaining test period, at each increment of 90[deg] fuel spillage during any 1 minute interval shall not exceed 28 g.</p><p class="depth0">S5.7. Alcohol fuel vehicles. Each vehicle manufactured to operate on an alcohol fuel (e.g., methanol, ethanol) or a fuel blend containing at least 20 percent alcohol fuel shall meet the requirements of S6.6.</p><p class="depth0">S6. Test requirements. Each vehicle with a GVWR of 4,536 kg or less shall be capable of meeting the requirements of any applicable barrier crash test followed by a static rollover, without alteration of the vehicle during the test sequence. A particular vehicle need not meet further requirements after having been subjected to a single barrier crash test and a static rollover test. Where manufacturer options are specified in this standard, the manufacturer must select an option not later than the time it certifies the vehicle and may not thereafter select a different option for that vehicle. Each manufacturer must, upon request from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, provide information regarding which of the compliance options it has selected for a particular vehicle or make/model.</p><p class="depth0">S6.1 Frontal barrier crash.
