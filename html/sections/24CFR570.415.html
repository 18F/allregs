                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability and objectives. HUD makes grants under CDWSP to  institutions of higher education, either directly or through areawide  planning organizations or States, for the purpose of providing  assistance to economically disadvantaged and minority students who  participate in a work study program while enrolled in full-time graduate  programs in community and economic development, community planning, and  community management. The primary objectives of the program are to  attract economically disadvantaged and minority students to careers in  community and economic development, community planning, and community  management, and to provide a cadre of well-qualified professionals to  plan, implement and administer local community development programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to CDWSP:</p><p class="depth2">Applicant means an institution of higher education, a State, or an  areawide planning organization that submits an application for  assistance under CDWSP.</p><p class="depth2">Areawide planning organization (APO) means an organization  authorized by law or by interlocal agreement to undertake planning and  other activities for a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area. For an  organization operating in a nonmetropolitan area to be considered an  APO, its jurisdiction must cover at least one county.</p><p class="depth2">CDWSP means the Community Development Work Study Program.</p><p class="depth2">Community building means community and economic development,  community planning, community management, land use and housing  activities.</p><p class="depth2">Community building academic program or academic program means a  graduate degree program whose purpose and focus is to educate students  in community building. ``Community building academic program'' or  ``academic program'' includes but is not limited to graduate degree  programs in community and economic development, community planning,  community management, public administration, public policy, urban  economics, urban management, and urban planning. ``Community building  academic program'' or ``academic program'' excludes social and  humanistic fields such as law, economics (except for urban economics),  education and history. ``Community building academic program'' or  ``academic program'' excludes joint degree programs except where both  joint degree fields have the purpose and focus of educating students in  community building.</p><p class="depth2">Economically disadvantaged and minority students means students who  satisfy all applicable guidelines established at the participating  institution of higher education to measure financial need for academic  scholarship or loan assistance, including, but not limited to, students  who are Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic, or Asian/ Pacific Island, and including students with disabilities.</p><p class="depth2">Institution of higher education means a public or private  educational institution that offers a community building academic  program and that is accredited by an accrediting agency or association  recognized by the Secretary of Education under 34 CFR part 602.</p><p class="depth2">Recipient means an approved applicant that executes a grant  agreement with HUD.</p><p class="depth2">Student means a student enrolled in an eligible full-time academic  program. He/she must be a first-year student in a two-year graduate  program. Students enrolled in Ph.D. programs are ineligible.</p><p class="depth2">Student with disabilities means a student who meets the definition  of ``person with disabilities'' in the Americans with Disabilities Act  of 1990.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assistance provided--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Types of assistance available. HUD  provides funding in the form of grants to recipients who make assistance  available to eligible students. Grants are provided to cover the costs  of student assistance and for an administrative allowance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Student assistance. Grants are made to recipients to cover the  costs of assistance provided to eligible students in the form of student  stipends, tuition support, and additional support.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Student stipend. The amount of the student stipend is based upon  the prevailing hourly rate for initial entry positions in community  building and the number of hours worked by the student at the work  placement assignment, except that the hourly rate used should be  sufficiently high to allow a student to earn the full stipend without  working over 20 hours per week during the school year and 40 hours per  week during the summer. The amount of the stipend the student receives  may not exceed the actual amount earned, up to $9,000 per year.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Tuition support and additional support. The amount of support  for tuition, fees, books, and travel related to the academic program,  workplace assignment or conferences may not exceed actual costs incurred  or $5,000 per year, whichever is higher. The conferences are limited to  those dealing with community building, sponsored by professional  organizations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Administrative allowance. HUD provides an allowance to  recipients to cover the administrative costs of the program. The  administrative allowance is $1,000 per year for each student  participating in the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Number of students assisted. The minimum number of students that  may   be assisted is three students per participating institution of higher  education. If an APO or State receives assistance for a program that is  conducted by two or more institutions of higher education, each  participating institution must have a minimum of three students in the  program. The maximum number of students that may be assisted under CDWSP  is five students per participating institution of higher education.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recipient eligibility and responsibilities--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recipient  eligibility. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The following organizations are eligible to apply for  assistance under the program:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Institutions of higher education. Institutions of higher  education offering a community building academic program are eligible  for assistance under CDWSP.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Areawide planning organizations and States. An APO or a State  may apply for assistance for a program to be conducted by two or more  institutions of higher education. Institutions participating in an APO  program must be located within the particular area that is served by the  APO and is identified by the State law or interlocal agreement creating  the APO. Institutions of higher education participating in a State  program must be located within the State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To be eligible in future funding competitions for CDWSP,  recipients are required to maintain a 50-percent rate of graduation from  a CDWSP-funded academic program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If an institution of higher education that submits an  individual application is also included in the application of an APO or  State, then the separate individual application of the institution of  higher education will be disregarded. Additionally, if an institution of  higher education is included in the application of both an APO and a  State, then the references to the institution in the application of the  State will be stricken. The State's application will then be ineligible  if fewer than two institutions of higher education remain as  participants in the State's application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recipient responsibilities. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The recipient is responsible for  the administration of the program, for compliance with all program  requirements, and for the coordination of program activities carried out  by the work placement agencies and (if the recipient is an APO or  State), by the participating institutions of higher education. The  recipient must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Recruit and select students for participation in CDWSP. The  recipient shall establish recruitment procedures that identify  economically disadvantaged and minority students pursuing careers in  community building, and make such students aware of the availability of  assistance opportunities. Students must be selected before the beginning  of the semester for which funding has been provided.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Recruit and select work placement agencies, and negotiate and  execute agreements covering each work placement assignment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Refer participating students to work placement agencies and  assist students in the selection of work placement assignments.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Assign sufficient staff to administer and supervise the program  on a day-to-day basis, and, where the recipient is an APO or State, to  monitor the activities of the work study coordinating committee.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Encourage participating students to obtain employment for a  minimum of two years after graduation with a unit of State or local  government, Indian tribe or nonprofit organization engaged in community  building.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Maintain records by racial and ethnic categories for each  economically disadvantaged student enrolled in the CDWSP.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Keep records and make such reports as HUD may require.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Comply with all other applicable Federal requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the recipient is an APO or State, the recipient must also:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Establish a committee to coordinate activities between program  participants, to advise the recipient on policy matters, to assist the  recipient in ranking and selection of participating students, and to  review disputes concerning compliance with program agreements and  performance. The committee shall be chaired by a representative of the  recipient, and shall include   representatives of the participating institutions of higher education,  work placement agencies, students, and HUD.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Allocate the assistance awarded under the program to the  participating institutions of higher education. APOs and States may not  make fractional awards to institutions. (E.g., awards to institutions  must assist a fixed number of students and not, for example, 6.5  students.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Institutions of higher education. Institutions of higher  education participating in a program are responsible for providing its  educational component. Where the recipient is an APO or State, the  institution of higher education shall assist the APO or State in the  administration and operation of the program. Responsibilities include  assisting the recipient in the selection of students by determining the  eligibility of students for the academic program, and by making the  analysis of students under the financial need guidelines established by  the institution. All institutions of higher education must comply with  other applicable Federal requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Work placement agencies eligibility and responsibilities--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Eligibility.

Work placement agencies must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide practical experience and training in community building.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Consult with the institution of higher education (and the APO  or State, where an APO or State is the recipient) to ensure that the  student's work placement assignment provides the requisite experience  and training to meet the required number of work hours specified in the  student work placement agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide a sufficient number of work placement assignments to  provide participating students with a wide choice of work experience.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Require each student to devote 12-20 hours per week during the  regular school year, or 35-40 hours a week during the summer, to the  work placement assignment. Work placement agencies may provide  flexibility in the work period, if such a schedule is consistent with  the requirements of the student's academic program. However, a  participating student may receive stipend payment only during the period  that the student is placed with the work placement agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Comply with all other applicable Federal requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Maintain such records as HUD may require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Student eligibility and responsibilities.

Participating students must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Enroll in a two-year program. A student's academic and work  placement responsibilities include: Full-time enrollment in an approved  academic program; maintenance of a satisfactory level of performance in  the community building academic program and in work placement  assignments; and compliance with the professional conduct standards set  by the recipient and the work placement agency. A satisfactory level of  academic performance consists of maintaining a B average. A student's  participation in CDWSP shall be terminated for failure to meet these  responsibilities and standards. If a student's participation is  terminated, the student is ineligible for further CDWSP assistance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Agree to make a good-faith effort to obtain employment in  community building with a unit of State or local government, an Indian  tribe, or a nonprofit organization. The term of employment should be for  at least two consecutive years following graduation from the academic  program. If the student does not obtain such employment, the student is  not required to repay the assistance received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notice of fund availability. HUD will solicit grant applications  from institutions of higher education, APO's and States by publishing a  notice of fund availability in the Federal Register. The notice will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Explain how application packages (requests for grant  applications) providing specific application requirements and guidance  may be obtained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specify the place for filing completed applications, and the  date by which the applications must be physically received at that  location;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State the amount of funding available under the notice;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provide other appropriate program information and guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Recipient selection process.

The initial  obligation of funds will provide for student grants for two years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disbursement. Recipients will receive grant payments by direct  deposit on a reimbursement basis. If that is not possible, grant  payments will be made by U.S. Treasury checks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deobligation and recipient repayment. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> HUD may deobligate  amounts for grants if proposed activities are not begun or completed  within a reasonable time after selection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a student's participation in CDWSP is terminated before the  completion of the two-year term of the student's program, the recipient  may substitute another student to complete the two-year term of a  student whose participation has terminated. The substituted student must  have a sufficient number of academic credits to complete the degree  program within the remaining portion of the terminated student's two- year term. With respect to any CDWSP grant, there is no requirement,  regardless of the date of grant award, for students who are terminated  from the CDWSP to repay tuition and additional assistance or for the  grant recipient to repay such funds to HUD. Funds must still be  otherwise expended consistent with CDWSP regulations and the grant  agreement, or repayment may be required under paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Consistent with OMB Circulars No. A-101 and A-110, HUD, in the  grant agreement, will set forth in detail other circumstances under  which funds may be deobligated, recipients may be liable for repayment,  or other sanctions may be imposed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Other Federal requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Handicap provision.
