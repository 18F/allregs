Although not required, such reports should identify categories of costs separately if possible, such as personnel costs (production-line, administrative, legal), costs of producing records, and costs associated with shutting down chemical production or processing during inspections, if applicable. This information should be reported to BIS on company letterhead at the address given in Sec. 716.6(d) of the CWCR, with the following notation: ``AATTN: Report of Inspection-related Costs.''</p>
