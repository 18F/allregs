Chapter 53 shall be selected from the approved STIP by the State in consultation with the affected non-metropolitan local officials with responsibility for transportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Federal Lands Highway program projects shall be selected from the approved STIP in accordance with the procedures developed pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 204.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The projects in the first year of an approved STIP shall constitute an ``agreed to'' list of projects for subsequent scheduling and implementation. No further action under paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section is required for the implementing agency to proceed with these projects. If Federal funds available are significantly less than the authorized amounts, or where there is significant shifting of projects among years, Sec. 450.330(a) provides for a revised list of ``agreed to'' projects to be developed upon the request of the State, MPO, or public transportation operator(s). If an implementing agency wishes to proceed with a project in the second, third, or fourth year of the STIP, the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section or expedited procedures that provide for the advancement of projects from the second, third, or fourth years of the STIP may be used, if agreed to by all parties involved in the selection process.</p>
