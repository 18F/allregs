Federal Government agencies, state law or fraud  enforcement agencies, and health plans must report other adjudicated  actions or decisions as defined in Sec. 60.3 of this part related to  the delivery, payment or provision of a health care item or service  against health care practitioners, providers, and suppliers (regardless  of whether the other adjudicated action or decision is subject to a  pending appeal).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Access to documents. Each state must provide the Secretary (or  an entity designated by the Secretary) with access to the documents  underlying the actions described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of  this section, as may be necessary for the Secretary to determine the  facts and circumstances concerning the actions and determinations for  the purpose of carrying out section 1921.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sanctions for failure to report. Any health plan that fails to  report information on another adjudicated action or decision required to  be reported under this section will be subject to a civil money penalty  (CMP) of not more than $25,000 for each such action not reported. Such  penalty will be imposed and collected in the same manner as CMPs under  subsection (a) of section 1128A of the Social Security Act.
