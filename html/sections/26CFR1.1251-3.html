                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Farm recapture property--(1) In general. (i) The term farm  recapture property means any property (other than section 1250 property  as defined in section 1250(c)) which, in the hands of the taxpayer is or  was property:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Which is described in section 1231(b)(1) (relating to business  property held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning  before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977), section  1231(b)(3) (relating to livestock), or section 1231(b)(4) (relating to  an unharvested crop), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Which, at the time the property qualifies under (a) of this  subdivision, is used in the trade or business of farming (as defined in  paragraph (e) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term farm recapture property also includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Property acquired by gift and property acquired in a transaction  to which section 1251(b)(5)(A) applies, if such property was farm  recapture property within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph in the hands of the transferor, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of  this subdivison (ii) property whose basis is determined in accordance  with the last sentence of section 1033(c) shall be considered as having  as basis determined by reference to the property whose conversion gave  rise to the application of such section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Leasehold of farm recapture property. If property is farm  recapture property under this subparagraph, a leasehold of such property  is also farm recapture property is also farm recapture property to the  same extent as described in, and in accordance with the principles of  paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.1245-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If property described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph  is stock or securities received in certain corporate transactions  described in section 1251(d)(6), see paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.1251-4 for  determination as to extent such stock or securities is farm recapture  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: On December 15, 1971, A, an individual calendar year  taxpayer engaged in the trade or business of farming (as defined in  paragraph (e) of this section) exchanges in a transaction which  qualifies under section 1031(a) (relating to an exchange of property   held for productive use or investment) tractor No. 1 which A acquired on  March 1, 1971, for tractor No. 2. Under subparagraph (1)(i) of this  paragraph, tractor No. 1 is farm recapture property as the tractor was  used in the trade or business of farming and was held for a period in  excess of 6 months. Under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph,  tractor No. 2 is farm recapture property as the basis of tractor No. 2  in the hands of A is determined with reference to the adjusted basis of  tractor No. 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Farm net loss--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term farm net loss means the  amount by which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The deductions allowed or allowable for the taxable year by  chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code which are directly connected with  the carrying on of the trade or business of farming, exceed</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The gross income derived from such trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disposition of farm recapture property. For purposes of  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, no gain or loss (regardless of how  treated) resulting from the disposition of farm recapture property shall  be taken into account, except that under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this  paragraph gain upon disposition of such property which is recognized as  ordinary income by reason of section 1245(a)(1) shall be taken into  account. Thus, for example, if land used in the trade or business of  farming were disposed of and gain of $3,000 was realized, then none of  such gain would be taken into account in computing farm net loss and  farm net income even if all or a portion of such gain is recognized as  ordinary income by reason of section 1251(c)(1), section 1252(a)(1), or  both. If such land were disposed of at a loss, the result would be the  same. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to the  exclusion of gain or loss from the disposition of farm recapture  property from the computation of nonfarm adjusted gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amount of deduction under section 172(a) attributable to farm  net loss. (i) If all or a portion of a net operating loss (within the  meaning of section 172(c)) for a taxable year is absorbed in another  taxable year as a carryover or carry back, then for purposes of  determining the amount of deductions referred to in subparagraph (1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  of this paragraph for such other taxable year the portion of the amount  absorbed in such other taxable year which is attributable to amounts  directly connected with the carrying on of the trade or business of  farming shall be an amount equal to the amount absorbed, multiplied by a  fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the farm net loss for  the taxable year the net operating loss arose (but not in excess of the  net operating loss for such year) and the denominator of which is the  amount of the net operating loss for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> or (4)(i)(b) of  Sec. 1.1251-2) shall be taken into account under subparagraph (1)(i) of  this paragraph in any other taxable year. Accordingly the same farm net  loss shall not be added to the excess deductions account more than once  and a farm net loss for any taxable year shall not be subject to the  $25,000 or $12,500 exclusion more than once.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a net operating loss for a current taxable year  attributable in whole or part to a farm net loss is carried back and  absorbed in a preceding taxable year no redetermination shall be made  with respect to (a) the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income  under section 1251(c)(1) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1251-1 in any  taxable year preceding the current taxable year, and (b) the amount of  the taxpayer's excess deductions account allocated under paragraph  (e)(2) of Sec. 1.1251-2 to a donee as of the close of any taxable year  preceding the current taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rules as to estates and trusts. In the case of an estate  or trust, computations of amounts under this paragraph shall be made  without regard to any deductions under section 651 or 661. If on the  termination of an estate or trust the beneficiaries succeeding to its  property are allowed a deduction under section 642(h) (relating to  unused loss carryovers and excess deductions on termination available to  beneficiaries), to the extent the carryover or excess deduction is  attributable to a farm loss it shall have the same character in the   hands of the beneficiary as in the hands of the estate or trust. The  amount of a carryover or of excess deductions from a particular taxable  year of an estate or trust succeeded to under section 642(h) shall be  allocated between amounts attributable to a farm net loss and other  amounts in the same proportion as the farm net loss for such year bears  to the amount of such carryover or of excess deductions. If there is  more than one beneficiary, the total farm net loss succeeded to by all  the beneficiaries shall be allocated to each beneficiary in proportion  to the deduction of each under section 642(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Farm net income. The term farm net income means the amount by  which the amount referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section  exceeds the amount referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Nonfarm adjusted gross income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term nonfarm  adjusted gross income means adjusted gross income (taxable income in the  case of a taxpayer other than an individual) computed without regard to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Income or deductions taken into account in computing farm net  loss and farm net income,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Gains and losses (regardless of how treated) resulting from the  disposition of farm recapture property, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of an estate or trust, the principles of paragraph  (b)(4) of this section, to the extent applicable, shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules. The following rules in addition to the rules of  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, shall apply in computing the  adjusted gross income of a shareholder of an electing small business  corporation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of any distribution described in section 1373 (c)(2)  made by the corporation shall be disregarded,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of computing the amount includible in the gross  income of a shareholder under section 1373(b), the corporation's  undistributable taxable income shall equal the corporation's nonfarm  adjusted gross income (as defined in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph)  minus the amount described in section 1373(c)(1), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of computing a shareholder's deduction under  section 1374, the corporation's net operating loss shall be computed  without regard to the items referred to in subparagraph (1) (i) and (ii)  of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Trade or business of farming--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of  section 1251, the term trade or business of farming includes any trade  or business with respect to which the taxpayer may compute gross income  under Sec. 1.61-4, expenses under Sec. 1.162-12, make an election  under section 175, 180, or 182, or use an inventory method referred to  in Sec. 1.471-6. Such term does not include any activity not engaged in  for profit within the meaning of section 183 and section 183-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Horse racing. If a taxpayer is engaged in the raising of horses,  including horses which are bred or purchased, then for purposes of  section 1251 the term trade or business of farming also includes the  racing of such horses by the taxpayer. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer  purchases a yearling and develops it to the racing stage, the term trade  or business of farming includes the racing of such horse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Several businesses of farming. If a taxpayer is engaged in more  than one trade or business of farming, all such trades and businesses  shall be treated as one trade or business.
