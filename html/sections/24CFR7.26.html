                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The aggrieved person may elect to participate in the EEO ADR Program or the traditional EEO counseling procedures. When ADR is chosen, the EEO Counselor shall advise the aggrieved person that if the dispute is resolved during the ADR process, the terms of the agreement must be in writing and signed by both the aggrieved person and the appropriate Department representative. The Director of EEO may execute ADR settlement agreements that are initiated in the EEO process. The EEO Counselor shall advise the aggrieved person that if no resolution is reached under the EEO ADR Program, or if the matter has not been resolved 90 days from the initial contact with the EEO Office, the aggrieved person will receive a final interview and the notice of right to file a formal complaint shall be issued by the EEO Counselor. Nothing said or done during attempts to resolve the complaint through ADR may be included in any EEO complaint (should ADR be unsuccessful) nor can the ADR proceedings be disclosed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In appropriate cases (as determined by the Director of EEO on a case-by-case basis), ADR is available during the formal complaint process. Participation in ADR at the formal complaint stage does not affect the normal processing of the formal complaint, including the investigation. Should ADR be initiated at the formal complaint stage, the time period for processing the complaint may be extended by agreement for not more than 90 days. If ADR does not resolve the issue(s), the complaint must be processed within the extended time period agreed upon by the parties, but no later than the 90th day.</p><p class="depth2">Complaints</p>
