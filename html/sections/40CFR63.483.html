                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At all times, each owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source subject to the requirements of this subpart, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by this standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source. Except as allowed under paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing or new affected source shall comply with the provisions in:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 63.484 for storage vessels;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 63.485 for continuous front-end process vents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sections 63.486 through 63.492 for batch front-end process vents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sections 63.493 through 63.500 for back-end process operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Section 63.501 for wastewater;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Section 63.502 for equipment leaks;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Section 63.504 for additional test methods and procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Section 63.505 for monitoring levels and excursions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Section 63.506 for general reporting and recordkeeping requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When emissions of different kinds (i.e., emissions from continuous front-end process vents, batch front-end process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, storage vessels, process wastewater, and/or in-process equipment subject to Sec. 63.149) are combined, and at least one of the emission streams would be classified as Group 1 in the absence of combination with other emission streams, the owner or operator of an affected source shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as appropriate. For purposes of this paragraph (b), owners or operators of affected sources with combined emission streams containing one or more batch front-end process vents and containing one or more continuous front-end process vents may comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as appropriate. For purposes of this paragraph (b), owners or operators of affected sources with combined emission streams containing one or more batch front-end process vents but not containing one or more continuous process vents shall comply with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Comply with the applicable requirements of this subpart for each kind of emission in the stream as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Comply with the first set of requirements, identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(v) of this section, which applies to any individual emission stream that is included in the combined stream, where either that emission stream would be classified as Group 1 in the absence of combination with other emission streams, or the owner or operator chooses to consider that emission stream to be Group 1 for purposes of this paragraph. Compliance with the first applicable set of requirements identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(v) of this section constitutes compliance with all other requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(v) of this section applicable to other types of emissions in the combined stream.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The requirements of this subpart for Group 1 continuous front-end process vents, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The requirements of Sec. 63.119(e), as specified in Sec. 63.484, for control of emissions from Group 1 storage vessels, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The requirements of Sec. 63.139, as specified in Sec. 63.501, for control devices used to control emissions from waste management units, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The requirements of Sec. 63.139, as specified in Sec. 63.501, for closed vent systems for control of emissions from in-process equipment subject to Sec. 63.149, as specified in Sec. 63.501, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The requirements of this subpart for aggregate batch vent streams, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator of an affected source with combined emission streams containing one or more batch front-end process vents, but not containing one or more continuous front-end process vents, shall comply with paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with Sec. 63.486 for the batch front-end process vent stream(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as appropriate, for the remaining emission streams.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Instead of complying with Secs. 63.484, 63.485, 63.493, and 63.501, the owner or operator of an existing affected source may elect to control any or all of the storage vessels, continuous

front-end process vents, batch front-end process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, back-end process emissions, and wastewater streams and associated waste management units within the affected source, to different levels using an emissions averaging compliance approach that uses the procedures specified in Sec. 63.503. The restrictions concerning which emission points may be included in an emissions average, including how many emission points may be included, are specified in Sec. 63.503(a)(1). An owner or operator electing to use emissions averaging shall still comply with the provisions of Secs. 63.484, 63.485, 63. 486, 63.493, and 63.501 for affected source emission points not included in the emissions average.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A State may decide not to allow the use of the emissions averaging compliance approach specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
