                                Sec. 35.3575  Application of Federal cross-cutting authorities
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A number of Federal laws, executive orders, and government-wide policies apply by their own terms to projects and activities receiving Federal financial assistance, regardless of whether the statute authorizing the assistance makes them applicable. A few cross-cutters apply by their own terms only to the State as the grant recipient because the authorities explicitly limit their application to grant recipients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application of cross-cutter requirements. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and in Sec. 35.3580, cross-cutter requirements apply in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All projects for which a State provides assistance in amounts up to the amount of the capitalization grant deposited into the Fund must comply with the requirements of the cross-cutters. Activities for which a State provides assistance from capitalization grant funds deposited into set-aside accounts must comply with the requirements of the cross-cutters, to the extent that the requirements of the cross-cutters are applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Projects and activities for which a State provides assistance in amounts that are greater than the amount of the capitalization grant deposited into the Fund or set-aside accounts are not subject to the requirements of the cross-cutters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A State that elects to impose the requirements of the cross-cutters on projects and activities for which it provides assistance in amounts that are greater than the amount of the capitalization grant deposited into the Fund or set-aside accounts may credit this excess to meet future cross-cutter requirements on assistance provided from the respective accounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Federal anti-discrimination law requirements. All programs, projects, and activities for which a State provides assistance are subject to the following Federal anti-discrimination laws: Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.; section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 794; and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6102.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Complying with cross-cutters. A State is responsible for ensuring that assistance recipients comply with the

requirements of cross-cutters, including initiating any required consultations with State or Federal agencies responsible for individual cross-cutters. A State must inform EPA when consultation or coordination with other Federal agencies is necessary to resolve issues regarding compliance with cross-cutter requirements.
