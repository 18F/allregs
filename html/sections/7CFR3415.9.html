At the Annual Conference, the participants may offer individual opinions regarding research needs, update information and discuss progress, or may offer individual opinions on areas of risk assessment research appropriate to agricultural biotechnology. The annual program solicitation will indicate whether funds are available to support an Annual Conference and, if so, will include instructions on the preparation and submission of proposals requesting funds from the Department for support of an Annual Conference. The Department may also elect to require principal investigators whose research is funded under this program to attend an Annual Conference and to present data on the results of their research efforts. Should attendance at an Annual Conference be required, the annual program solicitation will so indicate, and principal investigators may include attendance costs in their proposed budgets.</p><p class="depth0">The Director or Administrator may, with respect to any grant or to any

class of awards, impose additional conditions prior to or at the time of any award when, in the Director's or Administrator's judgment, such conditions are necessary to ensure or protect advancement of the approved project, the interests of the public, or the conservation of grant funds.</p>
