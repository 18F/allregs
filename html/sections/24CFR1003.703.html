If the Secretary finds a grantee has failed to comply with any provision of this part even after corrective actions authorized under Sec. 1003.701 have been applied, the following actions may be taken provided that reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing is made to the grantee. (The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.), where applicable, shall be a guide in any situation involving adjudications where the Secretary desires to take actions requiring reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Terminate the grant to the grantee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reduce the grant to the grantee by an amount equal to the amount which was not expended in accordance with this part; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limit the availability of funds to projects or activities not affected by such failure to comply; provided, however, that the Secretary may on due notice revoke the grantee's line of credit in whole or in part at any time if the Secretary determines that such action is necessary to preclude the further expenditure of funds for activities affected by such failure to comply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Secretarial referral to the Attorney General. If there is reason to believe that a grantee has failed to comply substantially with any provision of the Act, the Secretary may refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted. Upon such a referral, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States district court having venue thereof for such relief as may be appropriate, including an action to recover the amount of the assistance furnished under this part which was not expended in accordance with this part or for mandatory or injunctive relief.</p>
