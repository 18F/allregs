                            <p class="depth0">This section contains the additional equipment requirements for  ships that remain within sea areas A1, A2, or A3 at all times. Ships  fitting in accordance with this section satisfy the requirements denoted  in Sec. 80.1087 or Sec. 80.1089 for sea-areas A1 and A2. Ships fitting  in accordance to this section have the option to comply with either the  requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition to meeting the requirements of Sec. 80.1085, ships  subject to this section must be provided with:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An INMARSAT ship earth station capable of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Transmitting and receiving distress and safety data  communications;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Initiating and receiving distress priority calls;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Maintaining watch for shore-to-ship distress alert, including  those directed to specifically defined geographical areas;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Transmitting and receiving general radio communications, using  either radiotelephony or direct-printing telegraphy; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An MF radio installation capable of transmitting and receiving,  for distress and safety purposes, on the frequencies:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 2187.5 kHz using DSC; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 2182 kHz using radiotelephony; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A radio installation capable of maintaining a continuous DSC  watch   on the frequency 2187.5 kHz which may be separate from or combined with  that required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Means of initiating the transmission of ship-to-shore distress  alerts by a radio service operating either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Through the polar orbiting satellite service on 406.0-406.1 MHz  (this requirement may be fulfilled by the EPIRB required by Sec.  80.1085(a)(6), either by installing the EPIRB close to, or by allowing  remote activation from, the position from which the ship is normally  navigated); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On HF using DSC: or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Through the INMARSAT geostationary satellite service, by an  additional ship earth station.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (a)(4)(iii):</p><p class="depth4">For ships subject to this subpart, sailing only in domestic waters,  alternative satellite system fitting may be considered. However, the  satellite system fitted must comply with all features of the INMARSAT  system for its intended function. These are shown in IMO Resolution  A.801(19) and in IMO Resolution A.1001(25) (both incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 80.7). In any case, the alternative satellite  system must provide continuous coverage for all sea areas in which the  ship intends to sail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to meeting the requirements of Sec. 80.1085, ships  subject to this section must be provided with:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An MF/HF radio installation capable of transmitting and  receiving on all distress and safety frequencies in the bands between  1605-27500 kHz using DSC, radiotelephony, and narrow-band direct- printing telegraphy; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Equipment capable of maintaining DSC watch on 2187.5 kHz, 8414.5  kHz and on at least one of the distress and safety DSC frequencies  4207.5 kHz, 6312 kHz, 12577 kHz, or 16804.5 kHz although it must be  possible to select any of these DSC distress and safety frequencies at  any time (this equipment may be separate from, or combined with, the  equipment required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Means of initiating the transmission of ship-to-shore distress  alerts by a radio communication service other than HF operating either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Through the polar orbiting satellite service on 406.0-406.1 MHz  (this requirement may be fulfilled by the 406.0-406.1 MHz EPIRB required  by Sec. 80.1085(a)(6), either by installing the 406.0-406.1 MHz EPIRB  close to, or by allowing remote activation from, the position from which  the ship is normally navigated); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Through the INMARSAT geostationary satellite service (this  requirement may be fulfilled by an INMARSAT ship earth station).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In addition, ships must be capable of transmitting and receiving  general radio communications using radiotelephony or direct-printing  telegraphy by an MF/HF radio installation operating on working  frequencies in the bands between 1605-4000 kHz and between 4000-27500  kHz (this requirement may be fulfilled by the addition of this  capability to the equipment required by paragraph (b)(1) of this  section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It must be possible to initiate transmission of distress alerts  by the radio installations specified in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2),  (a)(4), (b)(1), and (b)(3) of this section from the position from which  the ship is normally navigated.
