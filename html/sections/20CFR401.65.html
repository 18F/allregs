                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How to request a correction. This section applies to all records kept by SSA (as described in Sec. 401.5) except for records of earnings. (20 CFR 422.125 describes how to request correction of your earnings record.) You may request that your record be corrected or amended if you believe that the record is not accurate, timely, complete, relevant, or necessary to the administration of a social security program. To amend or correct your record, you should write to the manager identified in the notice of systems of records which is published in the Federal Register (see Sec. 401.40(c) on how to locate this information). The staff at any social security office can help you prepare the request. You should submit any available evidence to support your request. Your request should indicate--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The system of records from which the record is retrieved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The particular record which you want to correct or amend;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether you want to add, delete or substitute information in the record; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Your reasons for believing that your record should be corrected or amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What we will not change. You cannot use the correction process to alter, delete, or amend information which is part of a determination of fact or which is evidence received in the record of a claim in the administrative appeal process. Disagreements with these determinations are to be resolved through the SSA appeal process. (See subparts I and J of part 404, and subpart N of part 416, of this chapter.) For example, you cannot use the correction process to alter or delete a document showing a birth date used in deciding your social security claim. However, you may submit a statement on why you think certain information should be altered, deleted, or amended, and we will make this statement part of your file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acknowledgment of correction request. We will acknowledge receipt of a correction request within 10 working days, unless we can review and process the request and give an initial determination of denial or compliance before that time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of error. If the record is wrong, we will correct it promptly. If wrong information was disclosed from the record, we will tell all those of whom we are aware received that information that it was wrong and will give them the correct information. This will not be necessary if the change is not due to an error, e.g., a change of name or address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Record found to be correct. If the record is correct, we will inform you in writing of the reason why we refuse to amend your record and we will also inform you of your right to seek a review of the refusal and the name and address of the official to whom you should send your request for review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Record of another government agency. If you request us to correct or amend a record governed by the regulation of another government agency, e.g., Office of Personnel Management, Federal Bureau of Investigation, we will forward your request to such government agency for processing and we will inform you in writing of the referral.</p>
