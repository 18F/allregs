The contract or deed of sale will provide further that in the event the purchaser fails to maintain and use the chapel for such purposes there shall become due and payable to the Government the difference, if any, between the appraised fair market value of the chapel, as of the date of the sale, without restriction on its use, and the price actually paid. This difference should be figured at the time of sale and included in the contract of sale or deed of conveyance.</p>
