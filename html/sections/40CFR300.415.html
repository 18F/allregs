The lead agency shall ensure that a contracting officer is available on-scene, at the request of the OSC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Removal actions shall, to the extent practicable, contribute to the efficient performance of any anticipated long-term remedial action with respect to the release concerned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following removal actions are, as a general rule, appropriate in the types of situations shown; however, this list is not exhaustive and is not intended to prevent the lead agency from taking any other actions deemed necessary under CERCLA, CWA section 311, or other appropriate federal or state enforcement or response authorities, and the list does not create a duty on the lead agency to take action at any particular time:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fences, warning signs, or other security or site control precautions--where humans or animals have access to the release;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drainage controls, for example, run-off or run-on diversion--where needed to reduce migration of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants off-site or to prevent precipitation or run-off from other sources, for example, flooding, from entering the release area from other areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Stabilization of berms, dikes, or impoundments or drainage or closing of lagoons--where needed to maintain the integrity of the structures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Capping of contaminated soils or sludges--where needed to reduce migration of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants into soil, ground or surface water, or air;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Using chemicals and other materials to retard the spread of the release or to mitigate its effects--where the use of such chemicals will reduce the spread of the release;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Excavation, consolidation, or removal of highly contaminated soils from drainage or other areas--where such actions will reduce the spread of, or direct contact with, the contamination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Removal of drums, barrels, tanks, or other bulk containers that contain or may contain hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants--where it will reduce the likelihood of spillage; leakage; exposure to humans, animals, or food chain; or fire or explosion;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Containment, treatment, disposal, or incineration of hazardous materials--where needed to reduce the likelihood of human, animal, or food chain exposure; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Provision of alternative water supply--where necessary immediately to reduce exposure to contaminated household water and continuing until such time as local authorities can satisfy the need for a permanent remedy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where necessary to protect public health or welfare, the lead agency shall request that FEMA conduct a temporary relocation or that state/local officials conduct an evacuation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the lead agency determines that the removal action will not fully address the threat posed by the release and the release may require remedial action, the lead agency shall ensure an orderly transition from removal to remedial response activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> CERCLA removal actions conducted by states under cooperative agreements, described in subpart F of this part, shall comply with all requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Facilities operated by a state or political subdivision at the time of disposal require a state cost share of at least 50 percent of Fund-financed response costs if a Fund-financed remedial action is conducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Fund-financed removal actions under CERCLA section 104 and removal actions pursuant to CERCLA section 106 shall, to the extent practicable considering the exigencies of the situation, attain applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements (ARARs) under

federal environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws. Waivers described in Sec. 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(C) may be used for removal actions. Other federal and state advisories, criteria, or guidance may, as appropriate, be considered in formulating the removal action (see Sec. 300.400(g)(3)). In determining whether compliance with ARARs is practicable, the lead agency may consider appropriate factors, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The urgency of the situation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The scope of the removal action to be conducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Removal actions pursuant to section 106 or 122 of CERCLA are not subject to the following requirements of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 300.415(a)(2) requirement to locate responsible parties and have them undertake the response;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 300.415(b)(2)(vii) requirement to consider the availability of other appropriate federal or state response and enforcement mechanisms to respond to the release;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Section 300.415(b)(5) requirement to terminate response after $2 million has been obligated or 12 months have elapsed from the date of the initial response; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Section 300.415(g) requirement to assure an orderly transition from removal to remedial action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> To the extent practicable, provision for post-removal site control following a CERCLA Fund-financed removal action at both NPL and non-NPL sites is encouraged to be made prior to the initiation of the removal action. Such post-removal site control includes actions necessary to ensure the effectiveness and integrity of the removal action after the completion of the on-site removal action or after the $2 million or 12-month statutory limits are reached for sites that do not meet the exemption criteria in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
