                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A cost is allocable to a particular Federal award or other cost  objective if the goods or services involved are chargeable or assignable  to that Federal award or cost objective in accordance with relative  benefits received. This standard is met if the cost:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is incurred specifically for the Federal award;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Benefits both the Federal award and other work of the non- Federal entity and can be distributed in proportions that may be  approximated using reasonable methods; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is necessary to the overall operation of the non-Federal entity  and is assignable in part to the Federal award in accordance with the  principles in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All activities which benefit from the non-Federal entity's  indirect (F&A;) cost, including unallowable activities and donated  services by the non-Federal entity or third parties, will receive an  appropriate allocation of indirect costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any cost allocable to a particular Federal award under the  principles provided for in this part may not be charged to other Federal  awards to overcome fund deficiencies, to avoid restrictions imposed by  Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal  awards, or for other reasons. However, this prohibition would not  preclude the non-Federal entity from shifting costs that are allowable  under two or more Federal awards in accordance with existing Federal  statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal  awards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Direct cost allocation principles. If a cost benefits two or  more projects or activities in proportions that can be determined  without undue effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to the projects  based on the proportional benefit. If a cost benefits two or more  projects or activities in proportions that cannot be determined because  of the interrelationship of the work involved, then, notwithstanding  paragraph (c) of this section, the costs may be allocated or transferred  to benefitted projects on any reasonable documented basis. Where the  purchase of equipment or other capital asset is specifically authorized  under a Federal award, the costs are assignable to the Federal award  regardless of the use that may be made of the equipment or other capital  asset involved when no longer needed for the purpose for which it was  originally required. See also Sec. Sec. 75.317 through 75.323 and  75.439.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the contract is subject to CAS, costs must be allocated to  the contract pursuant to the Cost Accounting Standards. To the extent  that CAS is applicable, the allocation of costs in accordance with CAS  takes precedence over the allocation provisions in this part.</p>
