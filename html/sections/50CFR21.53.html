                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Control of purple swamphens. Federal, State, Tribal, and local  wildlife management agencies, and their tenants, employees, or agents  may remove or destroy purple swamphens (Porphyrio porphyrio) or their  nests or   eggs at any time when they find them anywhere in the contiguous United  States, Hawaii, Alaska, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the U.S.  Virgin Islands. Any authorized agency personnel may temporarily possess,  transport, and dispose of purple swamphens, subject to the restrictions  in paragraph (c) of this section. No permit is necessary to engage in  these actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disposal of purple swamphens. If you are authorized to control  purple swamphens, you may dispose of purple swamphens by the following  methods: You may donate purple swamphens taken under this order to  public museums or public institutions for scientific or educational  purposes; you may dispose of the carcasses by burial or incineration;  or, if the carcasses are not readily retrievable, you may leave them in  place. No one may retain for personal use, offer for sale, or sell a  purple swamphen removed under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other provisions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may not remove or destroy purple  swamphens or their nests or eggs if doing so is contrary to any State,  territorial, tribal, or local laws or regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may not remove or destroy purple swamphens or their nests or  eggs if doing so will adversely affect other migratory birds or species  designated as endangered or threatened under the authority of the  Endangered Species Act. In particular, the purple swamphen resembles the  native purple gallinule (Porphyrula martinica). Authorized persons must  take special care not to take purple gallinules or their nests or eggs  when conducting purple swamphen control activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you use firearms to control purple swamphens under this  regulation, you may use only nontoxic shot or nontoxic bullets for the  control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If, while operating under this regulation, an authorized person  takes any other species protected under the Endangered Species Act, the  Migratory Bird Treaty Act, or the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act,  that person must immediately report the take to the nearest Ecological  Services office of the Fish and Wildlife Service. See http:// www.fws.gov/where/ to find the location of the nearest Ecological  Services office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> We may suspend or revoke the authority of any agency or  individual to undertake purple swamphen control if we find that agency  or individual has, without an applicable permit, taken actions that may  take Federally listed threatened or endangered species or any bird  species protected by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act or the  Migratory Bird Treaty Act (see Sec.  10.13 of subchapter A of this  chapter for the list of protected migratory bird species), or otherwise  violated Federal regulations.
