The provisions of this section are applicable  to any   State implementation plan which has been disapproved with respect to  visibility monitoring. Specific disapprovals are listed where applicable  in Subparts B through DD of this part. The provisions of this section  have been incorporated by reference into the applicable implementation  plan for various States, as provided in Subparts B through DDD of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Visibility protection area means any area listed in 40 CFR  81.401-81.436 (1984).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All other terms shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the  Clean Air Act, or in the protection of visibility program (40 CFR  51.301), all as in effect on July 12, 1985.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Monitoring Requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator, in cooperation  with the appropriate Federal land manager, shall monitor visibility  within each visibility protection area in any State whose State  implementation plan is subject to a disapproval for failure to satisfy  40 CFR 51.305 (1984).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator, in monitoring visibility within each such  area, shall determine both background visibility conditions and  reasonably attributable visibility impairment caused by a source or  small group of sources for that area. The extent and the form of  monitoring shall be sufficient for use in determining the potential  effects of a new stationary source on visibility in the area, the  stationary source or sources that are causing any visibility impairment,  and progress toward remedying that impairment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Administrator shall use the following as appropriate to  monitor visibility within each such area: (i) photographic cameras, (ii)  fine particulate matter samplers, (iii) teleradiometers, (iv)  nephelometers, (v) human observation, or (vi) other appropriate  technology.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Administrator, in cooperation with the Federal land  managers, shall prepare monitoring plans that describe, to the maximum  extent practicable, the methods and instruments of data collection, the  monitoring locations and frequencies, the implementation schedule, the  quality assurance procedures, and the methods of data reporting that the  Administrator will use for each area. The Administrator shall make these  plans available to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Administrator shall establish a central repository of  monitoring data that includes any data on background visibility  conditions and reasonably attributable impairment that the Administrator  collects under this section and that the Federal land manager may  collect or may have collected independently. These data shall be  available to any person, subject to reasonable charges for copying.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Monitoring Plan Revision. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator shall review the  monitoring plan annually for each visibility protection area, revise it  as necessary, and include an assessment of changes to visibility  conditions since the last review. The Administrator shall make all plan  revisions available to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person may make a request to the Administrator, at any time,  for a revision to a monitoring plan. The Administrator shall respond to  any such request within one year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Delegation. The Administrator may delegate, with respect to a  particular visibility protection area, any of his functions under this  section to any State or local air pollution control agency of any State  whose boundaries encompass that area or to any Federal land manager with  jurisdiction over the area.
