                            <p class="depth0">If the option to use a NOX CEMS is chosen:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each NOX diluent CEMS must be installed and certified  according to Performance Specification 2 (PS 2) in appendix B to this  part, except the 7-day calibration drift is based on unit operating  days, not calendar days. With state approval, Procedure 1 in appendix F  to this part is not required. Alternatively, a NOX diluent  CEMS that is installed and certified according to appendix A of part 75  of this chapter is acceptable for use under this subpart. The relative  accuracy test audit (RATA) of the CEMS shall be performed on a lb/MMBtu  basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As specified in Sec. 60.13(e)(2), during each full unit  operating hour, both the NOX monitor and the diluent monitor  must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing,  and data recording) for each 15-minute quadrant of the hour, to validate  the hour. For partial unit operating hours, at least one valid data  point must be obtained with each monitor for each quadrant of the hour  in which the unit operates. For unit operating hours in which required  quality assurance and maintenance activities are performed on the CEMS,  a minimum of two valid data points (one in each of two quadrants) are  required for each monitor to validate the NOX emission rate  for the hour.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each fuel flowmeter shall be installed, calibrated, maintained,  and operated according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Alternatively, with state approval, fuel flowmeters that meet the  installation, certification, and quality assurance requirements of  appendix D to part 75 of this chapter are acceptable for use under this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each watt meter, steam flow meter, and each pressure or  temperature measurement device shall be installed, calibrated,  maintained, and operated according to manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The owner or operator shall develop and keep on-site a quality  assurance (QA) plan for all of the continuous monitoring equipment  described in paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section. For the CEMS  and fuel flow meters, the owner or operator may, with state approval,  satisfy the requirements of this paragraph by implementing the QA  program and plan described in section 1 of appendix B to part 75 of this  chapter.</p>
