                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a claimant files a claim under this part while another claim filed by the claimant under this part is still pending, the later claim must be merged with the earlier claim for all purposes. For purposes of this section, a claim must be considered pending if it has not yet been finally denied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a claimant files a claim under this part within one year after the effective date of a final order denying a claim previously filed by the claimant under this part (see Sec. 725.502(a)(2)), the later claim must be considered a request for modification of the prior denial and will be processed and adjudicated under Sec. 725.310.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a claimant files a claim under this part more than one year after the effective date of a final order denying a claim previously filed by the claimant under this part (see Sec. 725.502(a)(2)), the later claim must be considered a subsequent claim for benefits. A subsequent claim will be processed and adjudicated in accordance with the provisions of subparts E and F of this part. Except as provided in paragraph (1) below, a subsequent claim must be denied unless the claimant demonstrates that one of the applicable conditions of entitlement (see Sec. Sec. 725.202(d) (miner), 725.212 (spouse), 725.218 (child), and 725.222 (parent, brother, or sister)) has changed since the date upon which the order denying the prior claim became final. The applicability of this paragraph may be waived by the operator or fund, as appropriate. The following additional rules apply to the adjudication of a subsequent claim:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The requirement to establish a change in an applicable condition of entitlement does not apply to a survivor's claim if the requirements of Sec. Sec. 725.212(a)(3)(ii), 725.218(a)(2), or 725.222(a)(5)(ii) are met, and the survivor's prior claim was filed--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On or before January 1, 2005, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After January 1, 2005 and was finally denied prior to March 23, 2010.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any evidence submitted in connection with any prior claim must be made a part of the record in the subsequent claim, provided that it was not excluded in the adjudication of the prior claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this section, the applicable conditions of entitlement are limited to those conditions upon which the prior denial was based. For example, if the claim was denied solely on the basis that the individual was not a miner, the subsequent claim must be denied unless the individual

worked as a miner following the prior denial. Similarly, if the claim was denied because the miner did not meet one or more of the eligibility criteria contained in part 718 of this subchapter, the subsequent claim must be denied unless the miner meets at least one of the criteria that he or she did not meet previously.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the applicable condition(s) of entitlement relate to the miner's physical condition, the subsequent claim may be approved only if new evidence submitted in connection with the subsequent claim establishes at least one applicable condition of entitlement. A subsequent claim filed by a surviving spouse, child, parent, brother, or sister must be denied unless the applicable conditions of entitlement in such claim include at least one condition unrelated to the miner's physical condition at the time of his death.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the claimant demonstrates a change in one of the applicable conditions of entitlement, no findings made in connection with the prior claim, except those based on a party's failure to contest an issue (see Sec. 725.463), will be binding on any party in the adjudication of the subsequent claim. However, any stipulation made by any party in connection with the prior claim will be binding on that party in the adjudication of the subsequent claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In any case in which a subsequent claim is awarded, no benefits may be paid for any period prior to the date upon which the order denying the prior claim became final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In any case involving more than one claim filed by the same claimant, under no circumstances are duplicate benefits payable for concurrent periods of eligibility. Any duplicate benefits paid will be subject to collection or offset under subpart H of this part.
