                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever any contractor or subcontractor is found by the  Secretary of Labor to be in aggravated or willful violation of the labor  standards provisions of any of the applicable statutes listed in Sec.  5.1 other than the Davis-Bacon Act, such contractor or subcontractor or  any firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which such  contractor or subcontractor has a substantial interest shall be  ineligible for a period not to exceed 3 years (from the date of  publication by the Comptroller General of the name or names of said  contractor or subcontractor on the ineligible list as provided below) to  receive any contracts or subcontracts subject to any of the statutes  listed in Sec. 5.1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases arising under contracts covered by the Davis-Bacon Act,  the Administrator shall transmit to the Comptroller General the names of  the contractors or subcontractors and their responsible officers, if any  (and any firms in which the contractors or subcontractors are known to  have an interest), who have been found to have disregarded their  obligations to employees, and the recommendation of the Secretary of  Labor or authorized representative regarding debarment. The Comptroller  General will distribute a list to all Federal agencies giving the names  of such ineligible person or firms, who shall be ineligible to be  awarded any contract or subcontract of the United States or the District  of Columbia and any contract or subcontract subject to the labor  standards provisions of the statutes listed in Sec. 5.1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> In addition to cases under which debarment action is  initiated pursuant to Sec. 5.11, whenever as a result of an  investigation conducted by the Federal agency or the Department of  Labor, and where the Administrator finds reasonable cause to believe  that a contractor or subcontractor has committed willful or aggravated  violations of the labor standards provisions of any of the statutes  listed in Sec. 5.1 (other than the Davis-Bacon Act), or has committed  violations of the Davis-Bacon Act which constitute a disregard of its  obligations to employees or subcontractors under section 3(a) thereof,  the Administrator shall notify by registered or certified mail to the  last known address, the contractor or subcontractor and its responsible  officers, if any (and any firms in which the contractor or subcontractor  are known to have a substantial interest), of the finding. The  Administrator shall afford such contractor or subcontractor and   any other parties notified an opportunity for a hearing as to whether  debarment action should be taken under paragraph (a)(1) of this section  or section 3(a) of the Davis-Bacon Act. The Administrator shall furnish  to those notified a summary of the investigative findings. If the  contractor or subcontractor or any other parties notified wish to  request a hearing as to whether debarment action should be taken, such a  request shall be made by letter postmarked within 30 days of the date of  the letter from the Administrator, and shall set forth any findings  which are in dispute and the reasons therefor, including any affirmative  defenses to be raised. Upon receipt of such request for a hearing, the  Administrator shall refer the case to the Chief Administrative Law Judge  by Order of Reference, to which shall be attached a copy of the letter  from the Administrator and the response thereto, for designation of an  Administrative Law Judge to conduct such hearings as may be necessary to  determine the matters in dispute. In considering debarment under any of  the statutes listed in Sec. 5.1 other than the Davis-Bacon Act, the  Administrative Law Judge shall issue an order concerning whether the  contractor or subcontractor is to be debarred in accordance with  paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section. In considering debarment under the  Davis-Bacon Act, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue a  recommendation as to whether the contractor or subcontractor should be  debarred under section 3(a) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any person or firm debarred under Sec. 5.12(a)(1) may in  writing request removal from the debarment list after six months from  the date of publication by the Comptroller General of such person or  firm's name on the ineligible list. Such a request should be directed to  the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards  Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210, and  shall contain a full explanation of the reasons why such person or firm  should be removed from the ineligible list. In cases where the  contractor or subcontractor failed to make full restitution to all  underpaid employees, a request for removal will not be considered until  such underpayments are made. In all other cases, the Administrator will  examine the facts and circumstances surrounding the violative practices  which caused the debarment, and issue a decision as to whether or not  such person or firm has demonstrated a current responsibility to comply  with the labor standards provisions of the statutes listed in Sec. 5.1,  and therefore should be removed from the ineligible list. Among the  factors to be considered in reaching such a decision are the severity of  the violations, the contractor or subcontractor's attitude towards  compliance, and the past compliance history of the firm. In no case will  such removal be effected unless the Administrator determines after an  investigation that such person or firm is in compliance with the labor  standards provisions applicable to Federal contracts and Federally  assisted construction work subject to any of the applicable statutes  listed in Sec. 5.1 and other labor statutes providing wage protection,  such as the Service Contract Act, the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act,  and the Fair Labor Standards Act. If the request for removal is denied,  the person or firm may petition for review by the Administrative Review  Board pursuant to 29 CFR part 7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> Section 3(a) of the Davis-Bacon Act provides that for a  period of three years from date of publication on the ineligible list,  no contract shall be awarded to any persons or firms placed on the list  as a result of a finding by the Comptroller General that such persons or  firms have disregarded obligations to employees and subcontractors under  that Act, and further, that no contract shall be awarded to ``any firm,  corporation, partnership, or association in which such persons or firms  have an interest.'' Paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section similarly provides  that for a period not to exceed three years from   date of publication on the ineligible list, no contract subject to any  of the statutes listed in Sec. 5.1 shall be awarded to any contractor  or subcontractor on the ineligible list pursuant to that paragraph, or  to ``any firm, corporation, partnership, or association'' in which such  contractor or subcontractor has a ``substantial interest.'' A finding as  to whether persons or firms whose names appear on the ineligible list  have an interest (or a substantial interest, as appropriate) in any  other firm, corporation, partnership, or association, may be made  through investigation, hearing, or otherwise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Administrator, on his/her own motion or after receipt of  a request for a determination pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this  section may make a finding on the issue of interest (or substantial  interest, as appropriate).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the Administrator determines that there may be an interest  (or substantial interest, as appropriate), but finds that there is  insufficient evidence to render a final ruling thereon, the  Administrator may refer the issue to the Chief Administrative Law Judge  in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the Administrator finds that no interest (or substantial  interest, as appropriate) exists, or that there is not sufficient  information to warrant the initiation of an investigation, the  requesting party, if any, will be so notified and no further action  taken.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the Administrator finds that an interest (or substantial  interest, as appropriate) exists, the person or firm affected will be  notified of the Administrator's finding (by certified mail to the last  known address), which shall include the reasons therefor, and such  person or firm shall be afforded an opportunity to request that a  hearing be held to render a decision on the issue.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Such person or firm shall have 20 days from the date of the  Administrator's ruling to request a hearing. A detailed statement of the  reasons why the Administrator's ruling is in error, including facts  alleged to be in dispute, if any, shall be submitted with the request  for a hearing.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If no hearing is requested within the time mentioned in  paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, the Administrator's finding  shall be final and the Administrator shall so notify the Comptroller  General. If a hearing is requested, the ruling of the Administrator  shall be inoperative unless and until the administrative law judge or  the Administrative Review Board issues an order that there is an  interest (or substantial interest, as appropriate).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A request for a determination of interest (or substantial  interest, as appropriate), may be made by any interested party,  including contractors or prospective contractors and associations of  contractor's representatives of employees, and interested Government  agencies. Such a request shall be submitted in writing to the  Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards  Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The request shall include a statement setting forth in detail  why the petitioner believes that a person or firm whose name appears on  the debarred bidders list has an interest (or a substantial interest, as  appropriate) in any firm, corporation, partnership, or association which  is seeking or has been awarded a contract of the United States or the  District of Columbia, or which is subject to any of the statutes listed  in Sec. 5.1. No particular form is prescribed for the submission of a  request under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Referral to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The  Administrator, on his/her own motion under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this  section or upon a request for hearing where the Administrator determines  that relevant facts are in dispute, will by order refer the issue to the  Chief Administrative Law Judge, for designation of an Administrative Law  Judge who shall conduct such hearings as may be necessary to render a  decision solely on the issue of interest (or substantial interest, as  appropriate). Such proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the  procedures set forth at 29 CFR part 6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Referral to the Administrative Review Board. If the person or  firm affected requests a hearing and the Administrator determines that  relevant facts are not in dispute, the Administrator will refer the  issue and the record compiled thereon to the Administrative Review Board  to render a decision solely on the issue of interest (or substantial  interest, as appropriate). Such proceeding shall be conducted in  accordance with the procedures set forth at 29 CFR part 7.  [48 FR 19541, Apr. 29, 1983, as amended at 48 FR 50313, Nov. 1, 1983]</p>
