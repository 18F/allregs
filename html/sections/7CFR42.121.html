                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Following skip lot procedure authorization, inspect every lot  consecutively offered for inspection using normal inspection procedures  as set forth in Subpart B of this part. When 10 consecutive lots are  acceptable, inspect only one-half of the lots offered for inspection  using normal inspection procedures. While on the one-half inspection  rate, when 10 consecutively inspected lots are acceptable, inspect only  one-fourth of the lots offered for inspection using normal inspection  procedures. While on the one-half or one-fourth inspection rate, if any  formally inspected lot is unacceptable, revert immediately to the  inspection of every lot using normal inspection procedures and  recommence the above procedure. See Sec. 42.123 for a flow diagram of  the skip lot sampling plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Two exceptions to the procedures in paragraph (a) of this  section are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The skip lot sampling and inspection rate of one-half can be  instituted immediately if the lots from the producer are currently on,  or eligible to be on, reduced inspection and all other conditions in  Sec. 42.120 are met. After skip lot sampling and inspection begins,  however, only normal inspection is permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> While inspecting every lot consecutively as offered for  inspection, i.e., while not on the one-half or one-fourth sampling and  inspection rate, if requirements for switching from normal to tightened  inspection are met as specified in Sec. 42.108 then skip lot procedures  terminate, tightened inspection is initiated, and stationary lot  sampling and inspection procedures in Subpart B are instituted. Skip lot  procedures may be instituted again only when all conditions of Sec.  42.120 are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All lot selections for the one-half and one-fourth inspection  rates must be strictly random (for example, not every other lot or every  fourth lot). Use of random number tables, coin flipping, or numbered  cards is encouraged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Preliminary scanning procedures (see Sec. 42.105) shall be used  on all lots scheduled for formal inspection and also shall be used on  lots not scheduled for inspection (``skipped'' lots) whenever the  inspector feels such action is prudent to further insure the  acceptability of such lots.</p>
