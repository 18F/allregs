                            <p class="depth0">Interim controls of lead-based paint hazards identified in a risk assessment shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this section. Interim control measures include paint stabilization of deteriorated paint, treatments for friction and impact surfaces where levels of lead dust are above the levels specified in Sec. 35.1320, dust control, and lead-contaminated soil control. As provided by Sec. 35.155, interim controls may be performed in combination with, or be replaced by, abatement methods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements.

Interim control treatments of intact, factory applied prime coatings on metal surfaces are not required. Finish coatings on such surfaces shall be treated by interim controls if those coatings contain lead-based paint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any physical defect in the substrate of a painted surface or component that is causing deterioration of the surface or component shall be repaired before treating the surface or component. Examples of defective substrate conditions include dry-rot, rust, moisture-related defects, crumbling plaster, and missing siding or other components that are not securely fastened.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before applying new paint, all loose paint and other loose material

shall be removed from the surface to be treated. Acceptable methods for preparing the surface to be treated include wet scraping, wet sanding, and power sanding performed in conjunction with a HEPA filtered local exhaust attachment operated according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Dry sanding or dry scraping is permitted only in accordance with Sec. 35.140(e) (i.e., for electrical safety reasons or for specified minor amounts of work).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Paint stabilization shall include the application of a new protective coating or paint.
