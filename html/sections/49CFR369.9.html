                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section governs requests for exemptions from  public release of the report required under Sec. 369.1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(4)</em>. Information is considered to be confidential when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosure of the information in the carrier's report would be  likely to cause substantial harm to the carrier's competitive position;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disclosure of information in the report would be likely to  impair protectable government interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents of a request. A request for an exemption from public  release must contain information supporting the   claim. While the supporting information may contain opinions, the  request must consist of objective data to the extent possible. General  or nonspecific assertions or analysis will be insufficient to support a  request if FMCSA is unable to find that the criteria are met. The  supporting information must show:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the information claimed to be confidential is a trade  secret, or commercial or financial information that is privileged or  confidential.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Measures taken by the carrier to ensure that the information has  not been disclosed or otherwise made available to any person, company,  or organization other then the carrier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Insofar as is known by the carrier, the extent to which the  information has been disclosed, or otherwise become available, to  persons other than the carrier, and why such disclosure or availability  does not compromise the confidential nature of the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the carrier asserts that disclosure would be likely to result  in substantial competitive harm, what the harmful effects of disclosure  would be, why the effects should be viewed as substantial, and the  causal relationship between the effects and disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the carrier asserts that disclosure would be likely to impair  protectable government interests, what the effects of disclosure are  likely to be and why disclosure is likely to impair such interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When requests are due. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests for an exemption under this  section may be made at any time during the year. However, a request will  be deemed applicable to only those reports due on or after the date the  request is received. Requests received after a report's due date will  only be considered for the following year's report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request will be deemed received on the date the request is  physically received or, if it is sent by mail, on the date it is  postmarked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FMCSA will only allow a late request if there are extenuating  circumstances and the carrier gives adequate notice within a reasonable  time of the extenuating circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Decision to grant or deny a request. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After each due date of  each annual report specified in Sec. 369.1, FMCSA will publish a notice  in the Federal Register requesting comments on any requests received  under this section that are valid and pending.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request will be granted only if it provides all of the  supporting information required in paragraph (c) of this section and if  the supporting information is sufficient to establish that information  in the carrier's report meets the criteria in paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the carrier fails to comply with the timing requirements of  paragraph (d) of this section, the claim for confidentiality will be  waived unless FMCSA is notified of extenuating circumstances before the  information is disclosed to the public and FMCSA finds that the  extenuating circumstances warrant consideration of the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> FMCSA will grant or deny each request no later than 90 days  after the request's due date as defined in paragraph (d) of this  section. The decision by FMCSA shall be administratively final. For  Annual Form M, both the report and the request are due by March 31, and  the decision is due by June 30.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a request is granted, FMCSA will notify carrier of that  decision and of any appropriate limitations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If a request for confidentiality is denied, FMCSA will notify  the carrier of that decision and that the information will be made  available to the public not less than ten working days after the carrier  has received notice of the denial. The notice will specify the reasons  for denying the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Pendency. A request is deemed pending from the date it is  received by FMCSA until it is granted or denied by FMCSA. FMCSA will not  release publicly, unless otherwise required by law, any report for which  a valid request for an exemption from public release is pending.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Period of exemptions. If a request for an exemption under this  section is granted, FMCSA will not publicly release the reports covered  by the granted exemption, unless otherwise required by law, for a period  of three years from the report's due date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Modification of a decision to grant a request. If a request is  granted it remains in effect in accordance with its terms, unless  modified by a later finding that the decision was clearly erroneous. If  FMCSA believes such a finding should be made, FMCSA will notify the  requesting carrier in writing of the reasons for the modification and  that the carrier's report will be made available to the public in not  less than ten working days from the date of receipt of notice under this  paragraph. The carrier may seek reconsideration of the modification.  [64 FR 13922, Mar. 23, 1999.
