                            <p class="depth0">This part implements the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and  Homeless Assistance Act, as amended (10 U.S.C. 2687 note), which  instituted a new community-based process for addressing the needs of the  homeless at base closure and realignment sites. In this process, Local  Redevelopment Authorities (LRAs) identify interest from homeless  providers in installation property and develop a redevelopment plan for  the installation that balances the economic redevelopment and other  development needs of the communities in the vicinity of the installation  with the needs of the homeless in those communities. The Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reviews the LRA's plan to see that  an appropriate balance is achieved. This part also implements the  process for identifying interest from State and local entities for  property under a public benefit transfer. The LRA is responsible for  concurrently identifying interest from homeless providers and State and  local entities interested in property under a public benefit transfer.</p>
