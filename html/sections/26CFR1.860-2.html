                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general--(1) Determination, etc. A qualified investment entity is allowed a deduction for a deficiency dividend only if there is a determination (as defined in section 860(e) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section) that results in an adjustment (as defined in section 860(d) (1) or (2)) for the taxable year for which the deficiency dividend is paid. An adjustment does not include an increase in the excess of (i) the taxpayer's interest income excludable from gross income under section 103(a) over (ii) its deductions disallowed under sections 265 and 171(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determination, etc. A qualified investment entity is allowed a deduction for a deficiency dividend only if there is a determination (as defined in section 860(e) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section) that results in an adjustment (as defined in section 860(d) (1) or (2)) for the taxable year for which the deficiency dividend is paid. An adjustment does not include an increase in the excess of (i) the taxpayer's interest income excludable from gross income under section 103(a) over (ii) its deductions disallowed under sections 265 and 171(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment date and claim. The deficiency dividend must be paid on, or within 90 days after, the date of the determination and before the filing of a claim under section 860(g) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This claim must be filed within 120 days after the date of the determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nature and amount of distribution. (i) The deficiency dividend must be a distribution of property (including money) that would have been properly taken into account in computing the dividends paid deduction under section 561 for the taxable year for which tax liability resulting from the determination exists if the property had been distributed during that year. Thus, if the distribution would have been a dividend under section 316(a) if it had been made during the taxable year for which the determination applies, and the distribution may qualify under sections 316(b)(3), 562(a), and 860(f)(1), even though the distributing corporation, trust, or association has no current or accumulated earnings and profits for the taxable year in which the distribution is actually made. The amount of the distribution is determined under section 301 as of the date of the distribution.
The amount of the deduction is subject to the applicable limitations under sections 562 and 860(f)(2). Thus, if the entity distributes to an individual shareholder property (other than money) which on the date of the distribution has a fair market value in excess of its adjusted basis in the hands of the entity, the amount of the deficiency dividend in the individual's hands for purposes of section 316(b)(3) is determined by using the property's fair market value on that date. Nevertheless, the amount of the deficiency dividend the entity may deduct is limited, under Sec. 1.562-1(a), to the adjusted basis of the property and the amount taxable to the individual as a dividend is determined by reference to the current and accumulated earnings and profits for the year to which the determination applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The deficiency dividend must be a distribution of property (including money) that would have been properly taken into account in computing the dividends paid deduction under section 561 for the taxable year for which tax liability resulting from the determination exists if the property had been distributed during that year. Thus, if the distribution would have been a dividend under section 316(a) if it had been made during the taxable year for which the determination applies, and the distribution may qualify under sections 316(b)(3), 562(a), and 860(f)(1), even though the distributing corporation, trust, or association has no current or accumulated earnings and profits for the taxable year in which the distribution is actually made. The amount of the distribution is determined under section 301 as of the date of the distribution.
The amount of the deduction is subject to the applicable limitations under sections 562 and 860(f)(2). Thus, if the entity distributes to an individual shareholder property (other than money) which on the date of the distribution has a fair market value in excess of its adjusted basis in the hands of the entity, the amount of the deficiency dividend in the individual's hands for purposes of section 316(b)(3) is determined by using the property's fair market value on that date. Nevertheless, the amount of the deficiency dividend the entity may deduct is limited, under Sec. 1.562-1(a), to the adjusted basis of the property and the amount taxable to the individual as a dividend is determined by reference to the current and accumulated earnings and profits for the year to which the determination applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The qualified investment entity does not have to distribute the full amount of the adjustment in order to pay a deficiency dividend. For example, assume that in 1983 a determination with respect to a calendar year regulated investment company results in an increase of $100 in investment company taxable income (computed without the dividends paid deduction) for 1981 and no other change. The regulated investment company may choose to pay a deficiency dividend of $100 or of any lesser amount and be allowed a dividends paid deduction for 1981 for the amount of that deficiency dividend.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Status of distributor. The corporation, trust, or association that pays the

deficiency dividend does not have to be a qualified investment entity at the time of payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Certain definitions to apply. For purposes of sections 860(d) (defining adjustment) and (f)(2) (limitations) the definitions of the terms ``investment company taxable income,'' ``real estate investment trust taxable income,'' and ``capital gains dividends'' in sections 852(b)(2), 857(b)(2), 852(b)(3)(C), and 857(b)(3)(C) apply, as appropriate to the particular entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination and claim for deduction--(1) Determination. For purposes of applying section 860(e), the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determination. For purposes of applying section 860(e), the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date of determination by a decision of the United States Tax Court, the date upon which a judgment of a court becomes final, and the date of determination by a closing agreement shall be determined under the rules in Sec. 1.547-2(b)(1) (ii), (iii), and (iv).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A determination under section 860(e)(3) may be made by an agreement signed by the district director or another official to whom authority to sign the agreement is delegated, and by or on behalf of the taxpayer. The agreement shall set forth the amount, if any, of each adjustment described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of section 860(d) (1) or (2) (as appropriate) for the taxable year and the amount of the liability for any tax imposed by section 11(a), 56(a), 852(b)(1), 852(b)(3)(A), 857(b)(1), 857(b)(3)(A), or 1201(a) for the taxable year. The agreement shall also set forth the amount of the limitation (determined under section 860(f)(2)) on the amount of deficiency dividends that can qualify as capital gain dividends and ordinary dividends, respectively, for the taxable year. An agreement under this subdivision (ii) which is signed by the district director (or other delegate) shall be sent to the taxpayer at its last known address by either registered or certified mail. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see Sec. 301.6212-2 of this chapter. If registered mail is used, the date of registration is the date of determination. If certified mail is used, the date of the postmark on the sender's receipt is the date of determination. However, if a dividend is paid by the taxpayer before the registration or postmark date, but on or after the date the agreement is signed by the district director (or other delegate), the date of determination is the date of signing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Claim for deduction. A claim for deduction for a deficiency dividend shall be made, with the requisite declaration, on Form 976 and shall contain the following information and have the following attachments:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the corporation, trust, or association;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the deficiency and the taxable year or years involved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of the unpaid deficiency or, if the deficiency has been paid in whole or in part, the date of payment and the amount thereof;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement as to how the deficiency was established (i.e., by an agreement under section 860(e)(3), by a closing agreement under section 7121, or by a decision of the Tax Court or court judgment);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any date or other information with respect to the determination that is required by Form 976;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The amount and date of payment of the dividend with respect to which the claim for the deduction for deficiency dividends is filed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The amount claimed as a deduction for deficiency dividends;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> If the amount claimed as a deduction for deficiency dividends includes any amount designated (or to be designated) as capital gain dividends, the amount of capital gain dividends for which a deficiency dividend deduction is claimed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Any other information required by the claim form;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> A certified copy of the resolution of the trustees, directors, or other authority authorizing the payment of the dividend with respect to which the claim is filed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> A copy of any court decision, judgment, agreement, or other document required by Form 976.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Filing claim. The claim, together with the accompanying documents, shall be filed with the district director, or director of the internal revenue service center, with whom the income tax return for the taxable year for which the determination applies was

filed. In the event that the determination is an agreement with the district director (or other delegate) described in section 860(e)(3) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the claim may be filed with the district director with whom (or pursuant to whose delegation) the agreement was made.
