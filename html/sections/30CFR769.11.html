This right does not apply to areas set aside from surface coal mining operations under laws other than the Act. For the purpose of this section, a person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected must demonstrate how he or she meets an ``injury in fact'' test by describing the injury to his or her specific affected interests and demonstrate how he or she is among the injured.</p>
