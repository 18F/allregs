This right does not apply to areas set  aside from surface coal mining operations under laws other than the Act.  For the purpose of this section, a person having an interest which is or  may be adversely affected must demonstrate how he or she meets an  ``injury in fact'' test by describing the injury to his or her specific  affected interests and demonstrate how he or she is among the injured.</p>
