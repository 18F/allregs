Sec. 774.3(a) and 774.3(c) for legal sufficiency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A Section 4(f) approval may involve different levels of detail  where the Section 4(f) involvement is addressed in a tiered EIS under  Sec. 771.111(g) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the first-tier, broad-scale EIS is prepared, the detailed  information necessary to complete the Section 4(f) approval may not be  available at that stage in the development of the action. In such cases,  the documentation should address the potential impacts that a proposed  action will have on Section 4(f) property and whether those impacts  could have a bearing on the decision to be made. A preliminary Section  4(f) approval may be made at this time as to whether the impacts  resulting from the use of a Section 4(f) property are de minimis or  whether there are feasible and prudent avoidance alternatives. This  preliminary approval shall include all possible planning to minimize  harm to the extent that the level of detail available at the first-tier  EIS stage allows. It is recognized that such planning at this stage may  be limited to ensuring that opportunities to minimize harm at subsequent  stages in the development process have not been precluded by decisions  made at the first-tier stage. This preliminary Section 4(f) approval is   then incorporated into the first-tier EIS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Section 4(f) approval will be finalized in the second-tier  study. If no new Section 4(f) use, other than a de minimis impact, is  identified in the second-tier study and if all possible planning to  minimize harm has occurred, then the second-tier Section 4(f) approval  may finalize the preliminary approval by reference to the first-tier  documentation. Re-evaluation of the preliminary Section 4(f) approval is  only needed to the extent that new or more detailed information  available at the second-tier stage raises new Section 4(f) concerns not  already considered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The final Section 4(f) approval may be made in the second-tier  CE, EA, final EIS, ROD or FONSI.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> documentation shall be developed by the applicant in  cooperation with the Administration.</p>
