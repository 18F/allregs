This information includes the  standardized Federal rates, the resident classification system that  provides the basis for case-mix adjustment (including the designation of  those specific Resource Utilization Groups under the resident  classification system that represent the required SNF level of care, as  provided in Sec. 409.30 of this chapter), and the factors to be applied  in making the area wage adjustment. This information is published before  May 1 for the fiscal year 1998 and before August 1 for the fiscal years  1999 and after.  [78 FR 47968, Aug. 6, 2013]</p>
