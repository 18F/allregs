In negotiating a compromise with a business concern, consideration is given to requiring a waiver of the tax-loss-carry-forward and tax-loss-carry-back rights of the debtor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If two or more debtors are jointly or severally liable, collection action is not withheld against one debtor until the other or others pay their share. The amount of a compromise with one debtor is not considered a precedent or binding in determining the amount which will be required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.</p>
