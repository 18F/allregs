If an application for renewal has been filed at least 30 days before the expiration date stated in the existing license, the existing license expires at the end of the day on which the Commission makes a final determination to deny the renewal application or, if the determination states an expiration date, the expiration date stated in the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each specific license revoked by the Commission expires at the end of the day on the date of the Commission's final determination to revoke the license, or on the expiration date stated in the determination, or as otherwise provided by Commission Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each specific license continues in effect, beyond the expiration date if necessary, with respect to possession of special nuclear material until the Commission notifies the licensee in writing that the license is terminated. During this time, the licensee shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limit actions involving special nuclear material to those related to decommissioning; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continue to control entry to restricted areas until they are suitable

for release in accordance with NRC requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within 60 days of the occurrence of any of the following, consistent with the administrative directions in Sec. 70.5, each licensee shall provide notification to the NRC in writing and either begin decommissioning its site, or any separate building or outdoor area that contains residual radioactivity, so that the building or outdoor area is suitable for release in accordance with NRC requirements, or submit within 12 months of notification a decommissioning plan, if required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section, and begin decommissioning upon approval of that plan if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The license has expired pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The licensee has decided to permanently cease principal activities, as defined in this part, at the entire site or in any separate building or outdoor area; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No principal activities under the license have been conducted for a period of 24 months; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No principal activities have been conducted for a period of 24 months in any separate building or outdoor area that contains residual radioactivity such that the building or outdoor area is unsuitable for release in accordance with NRC requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Coincident with the notification required by paragraph (d) of this section, the licensee shall maintain in effect all decommissioning financial assurances established by the licensee pursuant to Sec. 70.25 in conjunction with a license issuance or renewal or as required by this section. The amount of the financial assurance must be increased, or may be decreased, as appropriate, to cover the detailed cost estimate for decommissioning established pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any licensee who has not provided financial assurance to cover the detailed cost estimate submitted with the decommissioning plan shall do so when this rule becomes effective November 24, 1995.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Following approval of the decommissioning plan, a licensee may reduce the amount of the financial assurance as decommissioning proceeds and radiological contamination is reduced at the site with the approval of the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Commission may grant a request to delay or postpone initiation of the decommissioning process if the Commission determines that this relief is not detrimental to the public health and safety and is otherwise in the public interest.
