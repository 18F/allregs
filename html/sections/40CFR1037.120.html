                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. You must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the new vehicle, including all parts of its emission control system, meets two conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is designed, built, and equipped so it conforms at the time of sale to the ultimate purchaser with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is free from defects in materials and workmanship that cause the vehicle to fail to conform to the requirements of this part during the applicable warranty period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Warranty period. (1) Your emission-related warranty must be valid for at least:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 5 years or 50,000 miles for spark-ignition vehicles and light heavy-duty vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 5 years or 100,000 miles for medium and heavy heavy-duty vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 2 years or 24,000 miles for tires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You may offer an emission-related warranty more generous than we require. The emission-related warranty for the vehicle may not be shorter than any basic mechanical warranty you provide to that owner without charge for the vehicle. Similarly, the emission-related warranty for any component may not be shorter than any warranty you provide to that owner without charge for that component. This means that your warranty for a given vehicle may not treat emission-related and non-emission-related defects differently for any component. The warranty period begins when the vehicle is placed into service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Components covered. The emission-related warranty covers vehicle speed limiters, idle shutdown systems, fairings, and hybrid system components, to the extent such emission-related components are included in the certified emission controls. The emission-related warranty covers all components whose failure would increase a vehicle's emissions of air conditioning refrigerants for vehicles subject to air conditioning leakage standards. The emission-related warranty covers tires and all components whose failure would increase a vehicle's evaporative emissions (for vehicles subject to evaporative emission standards). The emission-related warranty covers these components even if another company produces the component. Your emission-related warranty does not need to

cover components whose failure would not increase a vehicle's emissions of any regulated pollutant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Limited applicability. You may deny warranty claims under this section if the operator caused the problem through improper maintenance or use, as described in 40 CFR 1068.115.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Owner's manual. Describe in the owners manual the emission-related warranty provisions from this section that apply to the vehicle.</p>
