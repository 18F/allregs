If the consolidated institution does not so notify the Bank by the end of the period, the Bank shall require the liquidation of any outstanding indebtedness owed by the former member, shall settle all outstanding business transactions with the former member, and shall redeem or repurchase the Bank stock owned by the former member in accordance with Sec. 1263.29.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application.

If the capital plan for the Bank has taken effect, the amount of stock that the consolidated institution is required to own shall be equal to the minimum investment established by the capital plan for that Bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Disapproval of membership. If the Bank disapproves the application for membership of the consolidated institution, the Bank shall require the liquidation of any outstanding indebtedness owed by, and the settlement of all other outstanding business transactions with, the former member, and shall redeem or repurchase the Bank stock owned by the former member in accordance with Sec. 1263.29.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dividends on acquired Bank stock.
