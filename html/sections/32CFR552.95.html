                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unit commanders may, during training area scheduling, request  that no permit holders be allowed in their areas. Justification must be  in the remarks column of HFL Form 473 (Range, Facility and Training Area  Request). If this restriction is granted, the Ft. Lewis Area Access  Section will close the appropriate areas. In the absence of a trainer's  request for closure, the following military activities are considered  incompatible with non-training access and will, when scheduled, block  affected areas:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Live-fire training events with surface danger zones falling into  training areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Parachute and air assault operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Field artillery firing. The numbered training area occupied by  the weapons will be closed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Motorized infantry operations that will use the majority of the  road net in a training area, traveling at higher than normal speeds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Training employing riot agents or smoke generating equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Range Officer may close training areas based on multiple  occupation by large units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Areas allocated to modern firearm deer hunting are closed to  training and recreational activities. When State Fish and Game pheasant  release sites can be isolated by swamps, streams, or roads from the rest  of a training area, multiple occupancy is authorized.</p>
