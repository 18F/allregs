                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose of prehearing conference. Unless a conference appears  unnecessary, the Presiding Officer, at any time before the hearing  begins, shall direct the parties and their counsel or other  representatives to appear at a conference before him to consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The settlement of the case;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The simplification of issues and stipulation of facts not in  dispute;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The exchange of exhibits, documents, prepared testimony, and  admissions or stipulations of fact which will avoid unnecessary proof;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Setting a time and place for the hearing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any other matters which may expedite the disposition of the  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exchange of witness lists and documents. Unless otherwise  ordered by the Presiding Officer, each party at the prehearing  conference shall make available to all other parties: the names of the  expert and other witnesses he intends to call, together with a brief  narrative summary of their expected testimony; and copies of all  documents and exhibits which each party intends to introduce into  evidence. Documents and exhibits shall be marked for identification as  ordered by the Presiding Officer. Documents that have not been exchanged  and witnesses whose names have not been exchanged shall not be  introduced into evidence or allowed to testify without permission of the  Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer shall allow the parties  reasonable opportunity to review new evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Record of the prehearing conference. No transcript of a  prehearing conference relating to settlement shall be made. With respect  to other prehearing conferences, no transcript of any prehearing  conferences shall be made unless ordered by the Presiding Officer upon  motion of a party or sua sponte. The Presiding Officer shall prepare and  file for the record a written summary of the action taken at the  conference and shall serve that summary on all parties in the manner  provided in Sec. 305.5(b)(2). The summary shall incorporate any written  stipulations or agreements of the parties and all rulings and  appropriate orders containing directions to the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Location of the prehearing conference. The prehearing conference  shall be held in the county where the release occurred, in the city in  which the EPA Regional Office is located (in the Region where the  release or threat of release occurred), or in Washington, DC, unless the  Presiding Officer determines that there is good cause to hold it at  another location or by telephone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unavailability of a prehearing conference. If a prehearing  conference is unnecessary or impracticable, the Presiding Officer, on  motion or sua sponte, may direct the parties to correspond with him to  accomplish any of the objectives set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Other discovery. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Discovery shall include any of the methods  described in rule 26(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The parties may conduct any mutually agreed upon discovery  without participation or determination of the Presiding Officer except  that such voluntary discovery may be subject to such time limitations as  the Presiding Officer deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided by paragraphs (b) and (f)(2) of this section,  further discovery, under this section, shall be permitted only pursuant  to order of the Presiding Officer. Any party to the proceeding desiring  an order of discovery shall make a motion therefore. Such motion shall  set forth:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The circumstances warranting the discovery;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The nature of the information expected to be discovered; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The method of discovery sought, including, where relevant, the  proposed time and place where the discovery will be conducted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Presiding Officer shall issue an order for discovery only  upon a showing of good cause and upon a determination:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That such discovery will not in any way unreasonably delay the  proceeding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the information to be obtained is not otherwise  obtainable; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That such information has significant probative value.  If the Presiding Officer determines that the motion should be granted,  he shall issue an order for such discovery together with the conditions  and terms thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Presiding Officer shall order depositions upon oral  questions only upon a finding that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The information sought cannot be obtained by alternative methods  of discovery; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There is a substantial reason to believe that relevant and  probative evidence may otherwise not be preserved for presentation by a  witness at the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When the information sought to be obtained is within the control  of one of the parties, failure to comply with an order issued pursuant  to this paragraph may lead to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The inference that the information to be discovered would be  adverse to the party from whom the information was sought; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The issuance of a default order under Sec. 305.24(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Interpreters. The Presiding Officer shall make the necessary  arrangements for the services of an interpreter upon the motion of a  party or sua sponte. The cost of the interpreter shall normally be borne  by the party requesting the service, but the Presiding Officer may  apportion the cost among the parties as justice demands.</p>
