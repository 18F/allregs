                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exposure of joints. All joints including welds must be left  uninsulated and exposed for examination during the test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Addition of temporary supports. Piping systems designed for  vapor or gas may be provided with additional temporary supports, if  necessary, to support the weight of the test liquid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Restraint or isolation of expansion joints. Expansion joints  must be provided with temporary restraint, if required for the  additional pressure load under test, or they must be isolated from the  test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Isolation of equipment not subjected to pressure test. Equipment  that is not to be subjected to the pressure test must be either  disconnected from the piping subassembly or system or isolated by a  blank flange or similar means. Valves may be used if the valve with its  closure is suitable for the proposed test pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Treatment of flanged joints containing blinds. Flanged joints at  which blinds are inserted to blank off other equipment during the test  need not be tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Precautions against test medium expansion. If a pressure test is  to be maintained for a period of time and the test medium in the system  is subject to thermal expansion, precautions must be taken to avoid  excessive pressure. A small relief valve set to 1\1/3\ times the test  pressure is recommended during the pressure test.  [CGD 73-254, 40 FR 40167, Sept. 2, 1975]</p>
