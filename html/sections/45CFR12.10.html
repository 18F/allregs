No permit to use surplus real property shall allow the permittee to make, or cause to be made, any irreversible change in the condition of said property, and no use permit shall be employed for the purpose of delaying or avoiding compliance with the requirements of these Acts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicants shall be required to provide such information as the Department deems necessary to make an assessment of the impact of the proposed Federal action on the human environment. Materials contained in the applicant's official request, responses to a standard questionnaire prescribed by the Public Health Service, as well as other relevant information, will be used by the Department in making said assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the assessment reveals (1) That the proposed Federal action involves properties of historical significance which are listed, or eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic Places, or (2) that a more than insignificant impact on the human environment is reasonably foreseeable as a result of the proposed action, or (3) that the proposed Federal action could result in irreparable loss or destruction of archeologically significant items or data, the Department will, except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section, prepare and distribute, or cause to be prepared or distributed, such notices and statements and obtain such approvals as are required by the above cited Acts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a proposed action involves other Federal agencies in a sequence of actions, or a group of actions, directly related to each other because of their functional interdependence, the Department may enter into and support a lead agency agreement to designate a single lead agency which will assume primary responsibility for coordinating the assessment of environmental effects of proposed Federal actions, preparing and distributing such notices and statements, or obtaining such approvals, as are required by the above cited Acts. The procedures of the designated lead agency will be utilized in conducting the environmental assessment. In the event of disagreement between the Department and another Federal agency, the Department will reserve the right to abrogate its lead agency agreement with the other Federal Agency.
