(i) A PHA may disclose the criminal conviction records which the PHA receives from a law enforcement agency only as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A PHA may disclose the criminal conviction records which the PHA receives from a law enforcement agency only as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> To officers or employees of the PHA, or to authorized representatives of the PHA who have a job-related need to have access to the information. For example, if the PHA is seeking to evict a public housing tenant on the basis of criminal activity as shown in criminal conviction records provided by a law enforcement agency, the records may be disclosed to PHA employees performing functions related to the eviction, or to a PHA hearing officer conducting an administrative grievance hearing concerning the proposed eviction.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> To the owner for use in connection with judicial eviction proceedings by the owner to the extent necessary in connection with a judicial eviction proceeding. For example, criminal conviction records may be included in pleadings or other papers filed in an eviction action, may be disclosed to parties to the action or the court, and may be filed in court or offered as evidence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> This disclosure may be made only if the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the PHA has determined that criminal activity by the household member as shown by such records received from a law enforcement agency may be a basis for eviction from a Section 8 unit; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the owner certifies in writing that it will use the criminal conviction records only for the purpose and only to the extent necessary to seek eviction in a judicial proceeding of a Section 8 tenant based on the criminal activity by the household member that is described in the criminal conviction records.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The PHA may rely on an owner's certification that the criminal record is necessary to proceed with a judicial eviction to evict the tenant based on criminal activity of the identified household member, as shown in the criminal conviction record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Upon disclosure as necessary in connection with judicial eviction proceedings, the PHA is not responsible for controlling access to or knowledge of such records after such disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Opportunity to dispute. If a PHA obtains criminal record information from a State or local agency under this

section showing that a household member has been convicted of a crime relevant to applicant screening, lease enforcement or eviction, the PHA must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the information and must provide the subject of the record and the applicant or tenant a copy of such information, and an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of the information. This opportunity must be provided before a denial of admission, eviction or lease enforcement action on the basis of such information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Records management. Consistent with the limitations on disclosure of records in paragraph (e) of this section, the PHA must establish and implement a system of records management that ensures that any criminal record received by the PHA from a law enforcement agency is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintained confidentially;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not misused or improperly disseminated; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Destroyed, once the purpose(s) for which the record was requested has been accomplished, including expiration of the period for filing a challenge to the PHA action without institution of a challenge or final disposition of any such litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Penalties for improper release of information--(1) Criminal penalty. Conviction for a misdemeanor and imposition of a penalty of not more than $5,000 is the potential for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Criminal penalty. Conviction for a misdemeanor and imposition of a penalty of not more than $5,000 is the potential for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any person, including an officer, employee, or authorized representative of any PHA or of any project owner, who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any information concerning an applicant for, or tenant of, covered housing assistance under the authority of this section under false pretenses; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any person, including an officer, employee, or authorized representative of any PHA or a project owner, who knowingly and willfully discloses any such information in any manner to any individual not entitled under any law to receive the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Civil liability. (i) A PHA may be held liable to any applicant for, or tenant of, covered housing assistance affected by either of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A PHA may be held liable to any applicant for, or tenant of, covered housing assistance affected by either of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A negligent or knowing disclosure of criminal records information obtained under the authority of this section about such person by an officer, employee, or authorized representative of the PHA if the disclosure is not authorized by this section; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any other negligent or knowing action that is inconsistent with this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An applicant for, or tenant of, covered housing assistance may seek relief against a PHA in these circumstances by bringing a civil action for damages and such other relief as may be appropriate against the PHA responsible for such unauthorized action. The United States district court in which the affected applicant or tenant resides, in which the unauthorized action occurred, or in which the officer, employee, or representative alleged to be responsible resides, has jurisdiction. Appropriate relief may include reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs.</p>
