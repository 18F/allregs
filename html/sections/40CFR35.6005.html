This subpart also codifies requirements for administering Superfund  State Contracts (SSCs) for non-State-lead remedial responses undertaken  pursuant to section 104 of CERCLA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> 2 CFR part 200, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost  Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards to Non-Federal  Entities,'' establishes consistency and uniformity among Federal  agencies in the administration of grants and Cooperative Agreements to  non-federal entities. For CERCLA-funded Cooperative Agreements, this  subpart supplements the requirements contained in 2 CFR parts 200 and  1500 for States, political subdivisions thereof, and Indian Tribes. This  subpart references those sections of 2 CFR parts 200 and 1500 that are  applicable to CERCLA-funded Cooperative Agreements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Superfund monies for remedial actions cannot be used by  recipients for Federal facility cleanup activities. When a cleanup is  undertaken by another Federal entity, the State, political subdivision  or Indian Tribe can pursue funding for its involvement in   response activities from the appropriate Federal entity.
