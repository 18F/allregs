The dairy  operation must also provide proof that the eligible production was also  commercially marketed during the same period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To be eligible for payment, dairy producers marketing milk  during February through July 2009 must provide any required supporting  documents to assist FSA in verifying production. Supporting  documentation may be provided by either the dairy producer or by the  dairy operation for each of its producers. Examples of supporting  documentation may include, but are not limited to: Milk marketing  payment stubs, tank records, milk handler records, daily milk  marketings, copies of any payments received as compensation from other  sources, or any other documents available to confirm the production and  production history of the dairy operation. Dairy operations and  producers may also be required to allow FSA to examine the herd of  cattle as production evidence. If supporting documentation requested is  not presented to FSA, the request for benefits will be denied.</p>
