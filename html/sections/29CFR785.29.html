                                Sec. 785.29  Training directly related to employee's job.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The training is directly related to the employee's job if it is  designed to make the employee handle his job more effectively as  distinguished from training him for another job, or to a new or  additional skill. For example, a stenographer who is given a course in  stenography is engaged in an activity to make her a better stenographer.  Time spent in such a course given by the employer or under his auspices  is hours worked. However, if the stenographer takes a course in  bookkeeping, it may not be directly related to her job. Thus, the time  she spends voluntarily in taking such a bookkeeping course, outside of  regular working hours, need not be counted as working time. Where a  training course is instituted for the bona fide purpose of preparing for  advancement through upgrading the employee to a higher skill, and is not  intended to make the employee more efficient in his present job, the  training is not considered directly related to the employee's job even  though the course incidentally improves his skill in doing his regular  work.
