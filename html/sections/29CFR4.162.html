                                Sec. 4.162  Fringe benefits under contracts exceeding $2,500.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> of the Act, fringe benefits   include medical or hospital care, pensions on retirement or death,  compensation for injuries or illness resulting from occupational  activity, or insurance to provide any of the foregoing, unemployment  benefits, life insurance, disability and sickness insurance, accident  insurance, vacation and holiday pay, costs of apprenticeship or other  similar programs and other bona fide fringe benefits not otherwise  required by Federal, State, or local law to be provided by the  contractor or subcontractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under this provision, the fringe benefits, if any, which the  contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish the service employees  engaged in the performance of the contract are specified in the contract  documents (see Sec. 4.6). How the contractor may satisfy this  obligation is dealt with in Sec. Sec. 4.170 through 4.177 of this part.  A change in the fringe benefits required by the contract provision will  not result from the mere fact that other or additional fringe benefits  are determined to be prevailing for such employees in the locality at a  time subsequent to the award but before completion of the contract. Such  fringe benefit determinations are effective for contracts not yet  awarded (see Sec. 4.5(a)), or in the event that changes in an existing  contract requiring their insertion for prospective application have  occurred (see Sec. Sec. 4.143 through 4.145). However, none of the  provisions of this paragraph may be construed as altering a successor  contractor's obligations under section 4(c) of the Act. (See Sec.  4.163.)</p>
