                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as described in Sec. 2806.26 of this chapter, the BLM will use the Per Acre Rent Schedule (see paragraph (c) of this section) to calculate rent for all linear right-of-way authorizations, regardless of the granting authority (FLPMA, MLA, and their predecessors). Counties (or other geographical areas) are assigned to an appropriate zone in accordance with Sec. 2806.21. The BLM will adjust the per acre rent values in the schedule annually in accordance with Sec. 2806.22(a), and it will revise the schedule at the end of each 10-year period in accordance with Sec. 2806.22(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The annual per acre rent for all types of linear right-of-way facilities is the product of 4 factors: The per acre zone value multiplied by the encumbrance factor multiplied by the rate of return multiplied by the annual adjustment factor (see Sec. 2806.22(a)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may obtain a copy of the current Per Acre Rent Schedule from any BLM state or field office or by writing: Director, BLM, 1849 C St., NW., Mail Stop 1000 LS, Washington, DC 20240. The BLM also posts the current rent schedule on the BLM Homepage on the Internet at http://www.blm.gov.
