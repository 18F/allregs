                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section covers Agency requirements for fiber optic service entrance cables intended for aerial installation either by attachment to a support strand or by an integrated self-supporting arrangement, for underground application by placement in a duct, or for buried installations by trenching, direct plowing, directional or pneumatic boring. Cable meeting this section is recommended for fiber optic service entrances having 12 or fewer fibers with distances less than 100 meters (300 feet).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. (i) Specification requirements are given in SI units which are the controlling units in this part. Approximate English equivalent of units are given for information purposes only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Specification requirements are given in SI units which are the controlling units in this part. Approximate English equivalent of units are given for information purposes only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The optical waveguides are glass fibers having directly-applied protective coatings, and are called ``fibers,'' herein. These fibers may be assembled in either loose fiber bundles with a protective core tube, encased in several protective buffer tubes, in tight buffer tubes, or ribbon bundles with a protective core tube.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fillers, strength members, core wraps, and bedding tapes may complete the cable core.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The core or buffer tubes containing the fibers and the interstices between the buffer tubes, fillers, and strength members in the core structure are filled with a suitable material or water swellable elements to exclude water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The cable structure is completed by an extruded overall plastic jacket. A shield or armor or combination thereof may be included under the jacket. This jacket may have strength members embedded in it, in some designs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> For rodent resistance or for additional protection with direct buried installations, it is recommended the use of armor under the outer jacket.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For self-supporting cable the outer jacket may be extruded over the support messenger and cable core.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> For detection purposes, the cable may have toning elements embedded or extruded with the outer jacket.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The cable is fully color coded so that each fiber is distinguishable from every other fiber. A basic color scheme of twelve colors allows individual fiber identification. Colored tubes, binders, threads, striping, or markings provide fiber group identification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cables manufactured to the requirements of this section must demonstrate compliance with the qualification testing requirements to ensure satisfactory end-use performance characteristics for the intended applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Optical cable designs not specifically addressed by this section may be allowed. Justification for acceptance of a modified design must be provided to substantiate product utility and long term stability and endurance. For information on how to obtain Agency's acceptance of such a modified design, refer to the product acceptance procedures available at http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/listing--procedures/index--listing--procedures.htm as well as RUS Bulletin 345-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The cable must be designed for the temperatures ranges of Table 1-1, Cable Normal Temperature Ranges, of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Tensile rating. The cable must have ratings that are no less than the tensile ratings indicated in paragraph 1.1.4, Tensile Rating, of Part 1 of the ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Self-supporting cables. Based on the storm loading districts referenced in Section 25, Loading of Grades B and C, of ANSI/IEEE C2-2007 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(b)), and the maximum span and location of cable installation provided by the end user, the manufacturer must provide a cable design with sag and tension tables showing the maximum span and sag information for that particular installation. The information included must be for Rule B, Ice and Wind Loading, and when applicable, information on Rule 250C, Extreme Wind Loading. Additionally, to ensure the proper ground clearance, typically a minimum of 4.7 m (15.5 feet), the end user should factor in the maximum sag under loaded conditions as well as height of attachment for each application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Minimum bend diameter. For cable under loaded and unloaded conditions, the cable must have the minimum bend diameters indicated in paragraph 1.1.5, Minimum Bend Diameter, of Part 1 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)). For very small cables, manufacturers may specify fixed cable minimum bend diameters that are independent of the outside diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> All cables sold to RUS Telecommunications borrowers must be accepted by the Agency's Technical Standards Committee ``A'' for projects involving RUS loan funds. All design changes to Agency acceptable designs must be submitted to the Agency for acceptance. Optical cable designs not specifically addressed by this section may be allowed, if accepted by the Agency. Justification for acceptance of a modified design must be provided to substantiate product utility and long term stability and endurance. For information on how to obtain the Agency's acceptance of cables, refer to the product acceptance procedures available at http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/listing--procedures/index--listing--procedures.htm as well as RUS Bulletin 345-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The Agency intends that the optical fibers contained in the cables meeting the requirement of this section have characteristics that will allow signals, having a range of wavelengths, to be carried simultaneously.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> The manufacturer is responsible to establish a quality assurance system meeting industry standards described in paragraph 1.8 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> The cable made must meet paragraph 1.10 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Optical fibers.

However, when the end user stipulates a low water peak fiber, the optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of Table 4, G.652.D attributes, of ITU-T Recommendation G.652; or when the end user stipulates a low bending loss fiber, the optical fibers must meet the fiber

attributes of Table 7-1, G.657 class A attributes, of ITU-T Recommendation G.657 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(f)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Additionally, optical ribbon fibers must meet paragraph 3.3, Optical Fiber Ribbons, of Part 3 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Multimode fibers. Optical fibers must meet the requirements of paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Matched cable. Unless otherwise specified by the buyer, all single mode fiber cables delivered to an Agency-financed project must be manufactured to the same MFD specification. However, notwithstanding the requirements indicated in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, the maximum MFD tolerance allowed for cables meeting the requirements of this section must be of a magnitude meeting the definition of ``matched cable,'' as defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1755.900. With the use of cables meeting this definition the user can reasonably expect that the average bi-directional loss of a fusion splice to be <=0.1 dB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Buyers will normally specify the MFD for the fibers in the cable. When a buyer does not specify the MFD at 1310 nm, the fibers must be manufactured to an MFD of 9.2 [micro]m with a maximum tolerance range of [0.5 [micro]m (362 [20 microinch), unless the buyer agrees to accept cable with fibers specified to a different MFD. When the buyer does specify a MFD and tolerance conflicting with the MFD maximum tolerance allowed by paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the requirements of paragraph (d)(4) must prevail.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Factory splices are not allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> All optical fibers in any single length of cable must be of the same type unless otherwise specified by end user.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Optical fiber dimensions and data reporting must be as required by paragraph 7.13.1.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Buffers/coating.
