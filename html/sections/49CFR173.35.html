                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No person may offer or accept a hazardous material for  transportation in an IBC except as authorized by this subchapter. Each  IBC used for the transportation of hazardous materials must conform to  the requirements of its specification and regulations for the  transportation of the particular commodity. A specification IBC, for  which the prescribed periodic retest or inspection under subpart D of  part 180 of this subchapter is past due, may not be filled and offered  for transportation until the retest or inspection have been successfully  completed. This requirement does not apply to any IBC filled prior to  the retest or inspection due date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial use and reuse of IBCs. (Also see Sec. 180.352 of this  subchapter.) An IBC other than a multiwall paper IBC (13M1 and 13M2) may  be reused. If an inner liner is required, the inner liner must be  replaced before each reuse. Before an IBC is filled and offered for  transportation, the IBC and its service equipment must be given an  external visual inspection, by the person filling the IBC, to ensure  that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The IBC is free from corrosion, contamination, cracks, cuts, or  other damage which would render it unable to pass the prescribed design  type test to which it is certified and marked; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The IBC is marked in accordance with requirements in  Sec. 178.703 of this subchapter. Additional marking allowed for each  design type may be present. Required markings that are missing, damaged  or difficult to read must be restored or returned to original condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)(iv)</em> of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding requirements in Sec. 173.24b of this subpart,  when filling an IBC with liquids, sufficient ullage must be left to  ensure that, at the mean bulk temperature of 50 C (122 F), the IBC is  not filled to more than 98 percent of its water capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where two or more closure systems are fitted in series, the  system nearest to the hazardous material being carried must be closed  first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> During transportation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No hazardous material may remain on the outside of the IBC; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each IBC must be securely fastened to or contained within the  transport unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each IBC used for transportation of solids which may become  liquid at temperatures likely to be encountered during transportation  must also be capable of containing the substance in the liquid state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Liquid hazardous materials may only be offered for  transportation in a metal, rigid plastic, or composite IBC that is  appropriately resistant to an increase in internal pressure likely to  develop during transportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(iv)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The gauge pressure (pressure in the IBC above ambient  atmospheric pressure) measured in the IBC at 55 C (131 F). This gauge  pressure must not exceed two-thirds of the marked test pressure and must  be determined after the IBC was filled and closed at 15 C (60 F) to  less than or equal to 98 percent of its capacity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The absolute pressure (vapor pressure of the hazardous material  plus atmospheric pressure) in the IBC at 50 C (122 F). This absolute  pressure must not exceed four-sevenths of the sum of the marked test  pressure and 100 kPa (14.5 psia).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The absolute pressure (vapor pressure of the hazardous  material plus atmospheric pressure) in the IBC at 55 C (131 F). This  absolute pressure must not exceed two-thirds of the sum of the marked  test pressure and 100 kPa (14.5 psia).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Twice the static pressure of the substance, measured at the  bottom of the IBC. This value must not be less than twice the static  pressure of water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Liquids having a vapor pressure greater than 110 kPa (16 psig)  at 50 C (122 F) or 130 kPa (18.9 psig) at 55 C (131 F) may not be  transported in metal IBCs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The requirements in this section do not apply to DOT-56 or -57  portable tanks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> No IBC may be filled with a Packing Group I liquid. Rigid  plastic, composite, flexible, wooden or fiberboard IBC used to transport  Packing Group I solid materials may not exceed 1.5 cubic meters (53  cubic feet) capacity. For Packing Group I solids, a metal IBC may not  exceed 3 cubic meters (106 cubic feet) capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> When an IBC is used for the transportation of liquids with a  flash point of 60 C (140 F) (closed cup) or lower, or powders with the  potential for dust explosion, measures must be taken during product  loading and unloading to prevent a dangerous electrostatic discharge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> IBC filling limits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in this section, an  IBC may not be filled with a hazardous material in excess of the maximum  gross mass marked on that container.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An IBC which is tested and marked for Packing Group II liquid  materials may be filled with a Packing Group III liquid material to a  gross mass not exceeding 1.5 times the maximum gross mass marked on that  container, if all the performance criteria can still be met at the  higher gross mass.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An IBC which is tested and marked for liquid hazardous materials  may be filled with a solid hazardous material to a gross mass not  exceeding the maximum gross mass marked on that container. In addition,  an IBC intended for the transport of liquids which is tested and marked  for Packing Group II liquid materials may be filled with a Packing Group  III solid hazardous material to a gross mass not exceeding the marked  maximum gross   mass multiplied by 1.5 if all the performance criteria can still be met  at the higher gross mass.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An IBC which is tested and marked for Packing Group I solid  materials may be filled with a Packing Group II solid material to a  gross mass not exceeding the maximum gross mass marked on that  container, multiplied by 1.5, if all the performance criteria can be met  at the higher gross mass; or a Packing Group III solid material to a  gross mass not exceeding the maximum gross mass marked on the IBC,  multiplied by 2.25, if all the performance criteria can be met at the  higher gross mass. An IBC which is tested and marked for Packing Group  II solid materials may be filled with a Packing Group III solid material  to a gross mass not exceeding the maximum gross mass marked on the IBC,  multiplied by 1.5.
