                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Criteria for removal. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f) of  this section, national natural landmark designation is removed from an  area:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When it can be shown that an error in professional judgment was  made such that the site did not meet the criteria for national  significance at the time of designation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the values which originally qualified it for designation  have been lost or destroyed; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When applicable designation procedures were not followed  because of prejudicial failure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any affected owner of a designated national natural landmark may  initiate the removal by submitting to the Director a request for removal  of designation, stating the grounds for this removal and specifying the  error in professional judgment, loss of natural values or prejudicial  procedural error. A prejudicial procedural error is one that reasonably  may be considered to have affected the outcome of the designation  process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within 60 days of receiving a removal request, the NPS notifies  the party submitting the request of whether the NPS considers the  documentation sufficient to consider removal of the natural landmark  designation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review of removal information. The NPS reviews the information  outlining the grounds for removal. When necessary, an on-site evaluation  of the area may be made, as outlined in Sec. 62.4(c). Based on all  available information, the NPS determines whether the area no longer  merits designation as a national natural landmark.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notifications. When NPS has determined that area no longer  merits designation as a national natural landmark, the NPS notifies the  owner(s) and other interested parties as specified in Sec. 62.4(d)(1)- (3). Notice of the proposed removal is also published in the Federal  Register. The notified individuals may comment within 60 days of the  date of the notice before a recommendation for removal is submitted to  the Secretary. All comments received will be considered in the review  and in the decision to remove the national natural landmark designation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Removal from the registry. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Director reviews the  information about a recommended removal from the Registry and determines  whether the procedural requirements in this section have been met. If  the Director confirms the findings, he or she submits a recommendation  for removal to the National Park System Advisory Board. The Advisory  Board reviews the submitted information and recommends the removal from  or retention of the area in the registry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The recommendations of the Advisory Board and the Director are  submitted by the Director to the Secretary for his or her consideration.  If the Secretary concurs, he or she directs the removal of the landmark  from the National Registry of Natural Landmarks. Any area from which  designation is withdrawn solely because of procedural error as described  in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section continues to meet the criteria  for national significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notification of removal from the registry. When the Secretary  removes a landmark from the National Registry of Natural Landmarks, the  Secretary will notify the national natural landmark owner(s), the  executive of the local government jurisdiction in which the area is  located, Native American tribal governments and native villages and  corporations in the area, the governor of the State, Congressional  members who represent the Congressional District and State in which the  area is located, and other interested authorities, organizations, and  individuals, as outlined in Sec. 62.4(d)(1), (2) and (3). The NPS is  responsible for preparing and distributing the written notices. The NPS  periodically publishes notice(s) of removal in the Federal Register. The  NPS may reclaim the natural landmark plaque when a landmark is removed  from the National Registry of Natural Landmarks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Previously designated landmarks. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NPS will notify owners of  national natural landmarks designated before the effective date of these  regulations to give them an opportunity within 90 days of the notice to  request the removal of a national natural landmark designation from  their property by writing to the Director. If owners do not respond  within 90 days of the notification, the national natural landmark  designations of their properties will be retained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When only some owners of a national natural landmark in multiple  ownership request the removal of a national natural landmark designation  from their portions, the NPS determines whether, after removal of these  portions, a sufficient acreage of the national natural landmark remains  to demonstrate the original nationally significant features without  undue compromise. If so, the boundaries of the national natural landmark  are adjusted to remove the properties of owners who object to the  designation. If not, the entire national natural landmark designation is  removed and the area is removed from the National Registry of Natural  Landmarks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any removals of existing national natural landmark designations  and related recommended boundary adjustments, must be presented by the  Director to the National Park System Advisory Board for review before  being presented to the Secretary who formally removes a national natural  landmark from the national registry or approves changes in the national  natural landmark boundary. Areas from which the designation has been  removed may be reconsidered for designation under these regulations if  ownership or other circumstances change.</p>
