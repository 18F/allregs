In this case, the owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle will be informed that law enforcement personnel are not responsible for safeguarding the POV.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The POV is illegally parked--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked, and interferes with the orderly flow of traffic.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a cross-walk, on a railroad track, in a fire lane, or is blocking a driveway, so that the vehicle interferes

with operations or creates a safety hazard to other roadway users or the general public. An example would be a vehicle parked within 15 feet of a fire hydrant or blocking a properly marked driveway of a fire station or aircraft-alert crew facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place (installation theater, club, dining hall, hospital, and other facility).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In a ``tow-away'' zone that is so marked with proper signs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The POV interferes with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Street cleaning or snow removal operations and attempts to contact the owner have been unsuccessful.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Emergency operations during a natural disaster or fire or must be removed from the disaster area during cleanup operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The POV has been used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner or person in charge has been apprehended and is unable or unwilling to arrange for custody or removal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the public roadways.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The POV is disabled by a traffic incident and the operator is either unavailable or physically incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or safekeeping.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.</p>
