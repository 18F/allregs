                                Sec. 179.95  Admission or exclusion of evidence; objections; offers of proof.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Written material identified as direct testimony or as an  evidentiary exhibit and offered by a party in a hearing, and oral  testimony, whether on direct or on cross-examination, is admissible as  evidence unless the presiding officer excludes it (on objection of a  party or on the presiding officer's own initiative) because it is  irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitive, or because its exclusion  is necessary to enforce a specific requirement of this part relating to  the admissibility of evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a party objects to the admission or rejection of any evidence  or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross- examination, the party shall state briefly the grounds for such  objection. The transcript shall include any argument or debate thereon,  unless the presiding officer, with the consent of all the parties,  orders that such argument not be transcribed. The ruling and the reasons  given therefor by the presiding officer on any objection shall be a part  of the transcript. An automatic exception to that ruling will follow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever evidence is deemed inadmissible, the party offering  such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the  transcript. The offer of proof for excluded oral testimony shall consist  of a brief statement describing the nature of the   evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a document or exhibit, it  shall be inserted in the record in total. If the Administrator in  reviewing the record under Sec. 179.112 decides that the presiding  officer's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous and  prejudicial, the hearing may be reopened to permit the taking of such  evidence, or, where appropriate, the Administrator may evaluate the  evidence and proceed to a final decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Official notice may be taken of Agency proceedings, any matter  that might be judicially noticed by the courts of the United States, or  any other fact within the knowledge and experience of the Agency as an  expert agency. Any party shall be given adequate opportunity to show  that such facts are erroneously noticed by presenting evidence to the  contrary.</p>
