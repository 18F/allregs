                            <p class="depth0">The return, along with remittance of special tax, must be filed on  or before the date of commencing business as a manufacturer of tobacco  products, manufacturer of cigarette papers or tubes, or export warehouse  proprietor, and thereafter every year on or before July 1. If the return  and applicable tax are received in the mail and the U.S. postmark on the  cover shows that it   was deposited in the mail in the United States within the time  prescribed for filing in an envelope or other appropriate wrapper which  was properly addressed with postage prepaid, the return will be  considered as timely filed. If the postmark is not legible, the sender  has the burden of proving the date when the postmark was made. When  registered mail is used, the date of registration will be accepted as  the postmark date. When certified mail is used, the date of the postmark  on the sender's receipt of certified mail is treated as the postmark  date.  (26 U.S.C. 5732, 6011, 6071)</p>
