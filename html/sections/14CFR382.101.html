                            <p class="depth0">When level-entry boarding and deplaning assistance is not required  to be provided under this subpart, you must, as a carrier, provide or  ensure the provision of boarding and deplaning assistance by any  available means to which the passenger consents. However, you must never  use hand-carrying (i.e., directly picking up the passenger's body in the  arms of one or more carrier personnel to effect a level change the  passenger needs to enter or leave the aircraft), even if the passenger  consents, unless this is the only way of evacuating the individual in  the event of an emergency. The situations in which level-entry boarding  is not required but in which you must provide   this boarding and deplaning assistance include, but are not limited to,  the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The boarding or deplaning process occurs at a U.S. airport that  is not a commercial service airport that has 10,000 or more enplanements  per year;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The boarding or deplaning process occurs at a foreign airport;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of this subpart;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The deadlines established in Sec. 382.99(c) have not yet  passed; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Circumstances beyond your control (e.g., unusually severe  weather; unexpected mechanical problems) prevent the use of a lift.</p>
