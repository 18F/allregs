                            <p class="depth0">The following examples will illustrate the application of the foregoing provisions to some of the programs aided by the Foundation. (In all cases the discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin prohibited by title VI of the Act and this part, as a condition of the receipt of Federal financial assistance.)</p><p class="depth0">1. For support to elementary or secondary schools such as for the acquisition of equipment discrimination by the recipient school district in any of its elementary or secondary schools, or by the recipient private institution, in the admission of students, or in the treatment of its students in any aspect of the educational process, is prohibited. In this and the following illustration the prohibition of discrimination in the treatment of students or other trainees includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or other facilities of the grantee or other recipient.</p><p class="depth0">2. In a research, training, or other grant to a university for activities to be conducted in a graduate school, discrimination in the admission and treatment of students in the

graduate school is prohibited, and the prohibition extends to the entire university.</p><p class="depth0">3. In a training grant to a hospital or other nonacademic institution, discrimination is prohibited in the selection of individuals to be trained and in their treatment by the grantee during their training. In a research or demonstration grant to such an institution, discrimination is prohibited with respect to any educational activity, any provision of medical or other services and any financial aid to individuals incident to the program.</p><p class="depth0">4. In grants to assist in the construction of facilities for research or for the provision of educational services, assurances will be required that services will be provided without discrimination, to the same extent that discrimination would be prohibited as a condition of Federal operating grants for the support of such services. Thus, as a condition of grants for the construction of academic, research, or other facilities at institutions of higher education, assurances will be required that there will be no discrimination in the admission or treatment of students. In other construction grants the assurances required will similarly be adapted to the nature of the activities to be conducted in the facilities for construction of which the grants have been authorized by Congress.</p><p class="depth0">5. Upon transfers of real or personal property for research or educational uses, discrimination is prohibited to the same extent as in the case of grants for the construction of facilities or the provision of equipment for like purposes.</p><p class="depth0">6. In some situations even though past discriminatory practices have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under Sec. 611.6(d) to provide information as to the availability of the program or activity, and the rights of beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example, of special arrangements for obtaining referrals which will insure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served but not the establishment of discriminatory qualifications for participation in any program.</p><p class="depth0">7. Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service.
