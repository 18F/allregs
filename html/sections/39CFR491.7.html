No other employee may release any information about employees except in conformity with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the regulations in 39 CFR Part 266, ``Privacy of Information.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Authorized Agent's response to legal process is sufficient if it contains only that information not otherwise protected from release by any federal statute including the Privacy Act.

Employment verification may be obtained by accessing the Postal Service's employment verification system by dialing 1-(800) 276-9850.</p>
