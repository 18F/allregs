Reserve funds will be used, as needed, for additional distributions during the remainder of the fiscal year and for those States that do not receive an initial distribution. States may not receive reserve funds for TAA administration or employment and case management services without a request for training funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A State requesting reserve funds must demonstrate that at least 50 percent of its training funds have been expended, or that it needs more funds to meet unusual and unexpected events. A State requesting reserve funds also must provide a documented estimate of expected funding needs through the end of the fiscal year. That estimate must be based on an analysis that includes at least the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The average cost of training in the State;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The expected number of participants in training through the end of the fiscal year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The remaining funds the State has available for training.</p>
