                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The minimum service required to qualify an applicant for an  endorsement as chief engineer (OSV) is 4 years of total service in the  engineroom of vessels. One year of this service must have been as an  engineer officer while holding an engineer officer endorsement. Two  years of the service must have been as a qualified member of the engine  department or equivalent position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an applicant has not obtained at least 50 percent of the  required experience on vessels of 4,000 HP/3,000 kW or more, a  propulsion power limitation is placed on the MMC based on the  applicant's qualifying experience. The endorsement is limited to the  maximum propulsion power on which at least 25 percent of the required  experience was obtained, or 150 percent of the maximum propulsion power  on which at least 50 percent of the service was obtained, whichever is  higher. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000 HP/750 kW, using the next  higher figure when an intermediate propulsion power is calculated. When  the limitation as calculated equals or exceeds 10,000 HP/7,500 kW, an  unlimited propulsion power endorsement is issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A person holding an endorsement as chief engineer (OSV) may  qualify for an STCW endorsement, according to Secs. 11.325, 11.327, and  11.331 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Coast Guard may exempt an applicant from meeting any  requirement under STCW Regulation III/2 (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 11.102 of this part) that the Coast Guard determines to be  inappropriate or unnecessary for service on an OSV, or that the  applicant meets under the equivalency provisions of Article IX of STCW.</p>
