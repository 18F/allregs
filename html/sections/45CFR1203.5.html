                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An application for Federal financial assistance to  which this part applies, except an application to which paragraph (d) of  this section applies, and every application for Federal financial  assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval  and the extension of Federal financial assistance pursuant to the  application, contain or be accompanied by, assurances that the program  will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with the  requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. Every award of Federal  financial assistance shall require the submission of these assurances.  In the case where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is  in the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein  or structures thereon, the assurances shall obligate the recipient, or,  in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period  during which the property is used for a purpose for which the Federal  financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the  provision of similar services or benefits, or for as long as the  recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is  longer. In other cases, the assurances obligate the recipient for the  period during which the Federal financial assistance is extended to the  program. In the case where the assistance is sought for the construction  of a facility or part of a facility, the assurances shall extend to the  entire facility and to the facilities operated in connection therewith.  ACTION shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances and the extent  to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors  and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other  participants. The assurances shall include provisions which give the  United States the right to seek judicial enforcement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a  transfer of real property, structures, or improvements thereon, or  interest therein, from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting  or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land  assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property  is used for a purpose involving the provision of similar services or  benefits. When no transfer of property of interest therein from the  Federal Government is involved, but property is acquired or improved  with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include  a covenant in any subsequent transfer of the property. When the property  is obtained from the Federal Government, the covenant may also include a  condition coupled with a right to be reserved by ACTION to revert title  to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the  discretion of ACTION, such a condition and right of reverter is  appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and  to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In the event a transferee of  real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real  property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement  of existing, facilities on property for the purposes for which the  property was transferred, ACTION may agree, on request of the transferee  and if necessary to accomplish the financing, and on conditions as he  deems appropriate, to subordinate a right of reversion to the lien of a  mortgage or other encumbrance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assurances from Government agencies. In the case of an  application from a department, agency, or office of a State or local  government for Federal financial assistance for a specified purpose, the  assurance required by this section shall extend to any other department,  agency, or office of the same governmental unit if the policies of the  other department, agency, or office will substantially affect the  project for which Federal financial assistance is requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assurance from academic and other institutions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case  of an application for Federal financial assistance by an academic  institution, the assurance required by this section extends to admission  practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of  students.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The assurance required by an academic institution, detention or  correctional facility, or any other institution or facility, relating to  the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment  of individuals as students, patients, wards, inmates, persons subject to  control, or clients of the institution or facility or to the opportunity  to participate in the provision of services, disposition, treatment, or  benefits to these individuals, is applicable to the entire institution  or facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Continuing Federal financial assistance. Every application by a  State or a State agency for continuing Federal financial assistance to  which this part applies (including the types of Federal financial  assistance listed in Appendix A to this part) shall as a condition to  its approval and the extension of Federal financial assistance pursuant  to the application:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program is  (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with  the requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide or be accompanied by provision for methods of  administration for the program as are found by ACTION to give reasonable  guarantee that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial  assistance under the program will comply with the requirements imposed  by or pursuant to this part.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  3001-0016, paragraph (a)(1))  [39 FR 27322, July 26, 1974, as amended at 47 FR 3553, Jan. 26, 1982; 68  FR 51387, Aug. 26, 2003]</p>
