                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and not exempted under section 4(b) of the  Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Obligation to establish and maintain reasonable claims  procedures. Every employee benefit plan shall establish and maintain  reasonable procedures governing the filing of benefit claims,  notification of benefit determinations, and appeal of adverse benefit  determinations (hereinafter collectively referred to as claims  procedures). The claims procedures for a plan will be deemed to be  reasonable only if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The claims procedures comply with the requirements of paragraphs  (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j) of this section, as  appropriate, except to the extent that the claims procedures are deemed  to comply with some or all of such provisions pursuant to paragraph  (b)(6) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of all claims procedures (including, in the case  of a group health plan within the meaning of paragraph (m)(6) of this  section, any procedures for obtaining prior approval as a prerequisite  for obtaining a benefit, such as preauthorization procedures or  utilization review procedures) and the applicable time frames is  included as part of a summary plan description meeting the requirements  of 29 CFR 2520.102-3;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The claims procedures do not contain any provision, and are not  administered in a way, that unduly inhibits or hampers the initiation or  processing of claims for benefits. For example, a provision or practice  that requires payment of a fee or costs as a condition to making a claim  or to appealing an adverse benefit determination would be considered to  unduly inhibit the initiation and processing of claims for benefits.  Also, the denial of a claim for failure to obtain a prior approval under  circumstances that would make obtaining such prior approval impossible  or where application of the prior approval process could seriously  jeopardize the life or health of the claimant (e.g., in the case of a  group health plan, the claimant is unconscious and in need of immediate  care at the time medical treatment is required) would   constitute a practice that unduly inhibits the initiation and processing  of a claim;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The claims procedures do not preclude an authorized  representative of a claimant from acting on behalf of such claimant in  pursuing a benefit claim or appeal of an adverse benefit determination.  Nevertheless, a plan may establish reasonable procedures for determining  whether an individual has been authorized to act on behalf of a  claimant, provided that, in the case of a claim involving urgent care,  within the meaning of paragraph (m)(1) of this section, a health care  professional, within the meaning of paragraph (m)(7) of this section,  with knowledge of a claimant's medical condition shall be permitted to  act as the authorized representative of the claimant; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The claims procedures contain administrative processes and  safeguards designed to ensure and to verify that benefit claim  determinations are made in accordance with governing plan documents and  that, where appropriate, the plan provisions have been applied  consistently with respect to similarly situated claimants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In the case of a plan established and maintained pursuant to a  collective bargaining agreement (other than a plan subject to the  provisions of section 302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act,  1947 concerning joint representation on the board of trustees)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Such plan will be deemed to comply with the provisions of  paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section if the collective bargaining  agreement pursuant to which the plan is established or maintained sets  forth or incorporates by specific reference--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Provisions concerning the filing of benefit claims and the  initial disposition of benefit claims, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A grievance and arbitration procedure to which adverse benefit  determinations are subject.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Such plan will be deemed to comply with the provisions of  paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) of this section (but will not be deemed to  comply with paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section) if the  collective bargaining agreement pursuant to which the plan is  established or maintained sets forth or incorporates by specific  reference a grievance and arbitration procedure to which adverse benefit  determinations are subject (but not provisions concerning the filing and  initial disposition of benefit claims).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Group health plans. The claims procedures of a group health plan  will be deemed to be reasonable only if, in addition to complying with  the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The claims procedures provide that, in the case of a failure  by a claimant or an authorized representative of a claimant to follow  the plan's procedures for filing a pre-service claim, within the meaning  of paragraph (m)(2) of this section, the claimant or representative  shall be notified of the failure and the proper procedures to be  followed in filing a claim for benefits. This notification shall be  provided to the claimant or authorized representative, as appropriate,  as soon as possible, but not later than 5 days (24 hours in the case of  a failure to file a claim involving urgent care) following the failure.  Notification may be oral, unless written notification is requested by  the claimant or authorized representative.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall apply only in the  case of a failure that--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is a communication by a claimant or an authorized representative  of a claimant that is received by a person or organizational unit  customarily responsible for handling benefit matters; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Is a communication that names a specific claimant; a specific  medical condition or symptom; and a specific treatment, service, or  product for which approval is requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The claims procedures do not contain any provision, and are not  administered in a way, that requires a claimant to file more than two  appeals of an adverse benefit determination prior to bringing a civil  action under section 502(a) of the Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To the extent that a plan offers voluntary levels of appeal  (except to the extent that the plan is required to do so by State law),  including voluntary arbitration or any other form of dispute resolution,  in addition to those   permitted by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the claims procedures  provide that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The plan waives any right to assert that a claimant has failed  to exhaust administrative remedies because the claimant did not elect to  submit a benefit dispute to any such voluntary level of appeal provided  by the plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The plan agrees that any statute of limitations or other  defense based on timeliness is tolled during the time that any such  voluntary appeal is pending;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The claims procedures provide that a claimant may elect to  submit a benefit dispute to such voluntary level of appeal only after  exhaustion of the appeals permitted by paragraph (c)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The plan provides to any claimant, upon request, sufficient  information relating to the voluntary level of appeal to enable the  claimant to make an informed judgment about whether to submit a benefit  dispute to the voluntary level of appeal, including a statement that the  decision of a claimant as to whether or not to submit a benefit dispute  to the voluntary level of appeal will have no effect on the claimant's  rights to any other benefits under the plan and information about the  applicable rules, the claimant's right to representation, the process  for selecting the decisionmaker, and the circumstances, if any, that may  affect the impartiality of the decisionmaker, such as any financial or  personal interests in the result or any past or present relationship  with any party to the review process; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> No fees or costs are imposed on the claimant as part of the  voluntary level of appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The claims procedures do not contain any provision for the  mandatory arbitration of adverse benefit determinations, except to the  extent that the plan or procedures provide that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The arbitration is conducted as one of the two appeals described  in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and in accordance with the  requirements applicable to such appeals; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The claimant is not precluded from challenging the decision  under section 502(a) of the Act or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Plans providing disability benefits. The claims procedures of a  plan that provides disability benefits will be deemed to be reasonable  only if the claims procedures comply, with respect to claims for  disability benefits, with the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c)(2),  (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Claim for benefits. For purposes of this section, a claim for  benefits is a request for a plan benefit or benefits made by a claimant  in accordance with a plan's reasonable procedure for filing benefit  claims. In the case of a group health plan, a claim for benefits  includes any pre-service claims within the meaning of paragraph (m)(2)  of this section and any post-service claims within the meaning of  paragraph (m)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Timing of notification of benefit determination--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.  Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, if a  claim is wholly or partially denied, the plan administrator shall notify  the claimant, in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, of the  plan's adverse benefit determination within a reasonable period of time,  but not later than 90 days after receipt of the claim by the plan,  unless the plan administrator determines that special circumstances  require an extension of time for processing the claim. If the plan  administrator determines that an extension of time for processing is  required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the  claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period. In no  event shall such extension exceed a period of 90 days from the end of  such initial period. The extension notice shall indicate the special  circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the  plan expects to render the benefit determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iii)</em> of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> shall be made in accordance with  paragraph (g) of this section. The plan administrator shall notify the  claimant of the plan's benefit determination as soon as possible, but in  no case later than 48 hours after the earlier of--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The plan's receipt of the specified information, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The end of the period afforded the claimant to provide the  specified additional information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Concurrent care decisions. If a group health plan has approved  an ongoing course of treatment to be provided over a period of time or  number of treatments--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any reduction or termination by the plan of such course of  treatment (other than by plan amendment or termination) before the end  of such period of time or number of treatments shall constitute an  adverse benefit determination. The plan administrator shall notify the  claimant, in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, of the  adverse benefit determination at a time sufficiently in advance of the  reduction or termination to allow the claimant to appeal and obtain a  determination on review of that adverse benefit determination before the  benefit is reduced or terminated.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any request by a claimant to extend the course of treatment  beyond the period of time or number of treatments that is a claim  involving urgent care shall be decided as soon as possible, taking into  account the medical exigencies, and the plan administrator shall notify  the claimant of the benefit determination, whether adverse or not,  within 24 hours after receipt of the claim by the plan, provided that  any such claim is made to the plan at least 24 hours prior to the  expiration of the prescribed period of time or number of treatments.  Notification of any adverse benefit determination concerning a request  to extend the course of treatment, whether involving urgent care or not,  shall be made in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, and  appeal shall be governed by paragraph (i)(2)(i), (i)(2)(ii), or  (i)(2)(iii), as appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)(B)</em> of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> shall be made in accordance with paragraph (g)  of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Post-service claims. In the case of a post-service claim, the  plan administrator shall notify the claimant, in accordance with  paragraph (g) of this section, of the plan's adverse benefit  determination within a reasonable period of time, but not later than 30  days after receipt of the claim. This period may be extended one time by  the plan for up to 15 days, provided that the plan administrator both  determines that such an extension is necessary due to matters beyond the  control of the plan and notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration  of the initial 30-day period, of the circumstances requiring the  extension of time and the date by which the plan expects to render a  decision. If such an extension is necessary due to a failure of the  claimant to submit the information necessary to decide the claim, the  notice of extension shall specifically describe the required  information, and the claimant shall be afforded at least 45 days from  receipt of the notice within which to provide the specified information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>, the notice of extension shall  specifically explain the standards on which entitlement to a benefit is  based, the unresolved issues that prevent a decision on the claim, and  the additional information needed to resolve those issues, and the  claimant shall be afforded at least 45 days within which to provide the  specified information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Calculating time periods. For purposes of paragraph (f) of this  section, the period of time within which a benefit determination is  required to be made shall begin at the time a claim is filed in  accordance with the reasonable procedures of a plan, without regard to  whether all the information necessary to make a benefit determination  accompanies the filing. In the event that a period of time is extended  as permitted pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(iii) or (f)(3) of this section  due to a claimant's failure to submit information necessary to decide a  claim, the period for making the benefit determination shall be tolled  from the date on which the notification of the extension is sent to the  claimant until the date on which the claimant responds to the request  for additional information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(2)</em> of this section, the plan  administrator shall provide a claimant with written or electronic  notification of any adverse benefit determination. Any electronic  notification shall comply with the standards imposed by 29 CFR  2520.104b-1(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em>, (iii), and (iv). The notification shall set forth,  in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reference to the specific plan provisions on which the  determination is based;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A description of any additional material or information  necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of  why such material or information is necessary;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A description of the plan's review procedures and the time  limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the  claimant's right to bring a civil action under section 502(a)   of the Act following an adverse benefit determination on review;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In the case of an adverse benefit determination by a group  health plan or a plan providing disability benefits,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If an internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar  criterion was relied upon in making the adverse determination, either  the specific rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion; or a  statement that such a rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar  criterion was relied upon in making the adverse determination and that a  copy of such rule, guideline, protocol, or other criterion will be  provided free of charge to the claimant upon request; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the adverse benefit determination is based on a medical  necessity or experimental treatment or similar exclusion or limit,  either an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the  determination, applying the terms of the plan to the claimant's medical  circumstances, or a statement that such explanation will be provided  free of charge upon request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> In the case of an adverse benefit determination by a group  health plan concerning a claim involving urgent care, a description of  the expedited review process applicable to such claims.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em>  of this section, provided that a written or electronic notification in  accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section is furnished to the  claimant not later than 3 days after the oral notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Appeal of adverse benefit determinations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Every  employee benefit plan shall establish and maintain a procedure by which  a claimant shall have a reasonable opportunity to appeal an adverse  benefit determination to an appropriate named fiduciary of the plan, and  under which there will be a full and fair review of the claim and the  adverse benefit determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Full and fair review. Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(3)  and (h)(4) of this section, the claims procedures of a plan will not be  deemed to provide a claimant with a reasonable opportunity for a full  and fair review of a claim and adverse benefit determination unless the  claims procedures--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide claimants at least 60 days following receipt of a  notification of an adverse benefit determination within which to appeal  the determination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide claimants the opportunity to submit written comments,  documents, records, and other information relating to the claim for  benefits;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide that a claimant shall be provided, upon request and  free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents,  records, and other information relevant to the claimant's claim for  benefits. Whether a document, record, or other information is relevant  to a claim for benefits shall be determined by reference to paragraph  (m)(8) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provide for a review that takes into account all comments,  documents, records, and other information submitted by the claimant  relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was  submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Group health plans. The claims procedures of a group health plan  will not be deemed to provide a claimant with a reasonable opportunity  for a full and fair review of a claim and adverse benefit determination  unless, in addition to complying with the requirements of paragraphs  (h)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section, the claims procedures--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide claimants at least 180 days following receipt of a  notification of an adverse benefit determination within which to appeal  the determination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide for a review that does not afford deference to the  initial adverse benefit determination and that is conducted by an  appropriate named fiduciary of the plan who is neither the individual  who made the adverse benefit determination that is the subject of the  appeal, nor the subordinate of such individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide that, in deciding an appeal of any adverse benefit  determination that is based in whole or in part   on a medical judgment, including determinations with regard to whether a  particular treatment, drug, or other item is experimental,  investigational, or not medically necessary or appropriate, the  appropriate named fiduciary shall consult with a health care  professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of  medicine involved in the medical judgment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provide for the identification of medical or vocational experts  whose advice was obtained on behalf of the plan in connection with a  claimant's adverse benefit determination, without regard to whether the  advice was relied upon in making the benefit determination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Provide that the health care professional engaged for purposes  of a consultation under paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section shall be  an individual who is neither an individual who was consulted in  connection with the adverse benefit determination that is the subject of  the appeal, nor the subordinate of any such individual; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Provide, in the case of a claim involving urgent care, for an  expedited review process pursuant to which--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A request for an expedited appeal of an adverse benefit  determination may be submitted orally or in writing by the claimant; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> All necessary information, including the plan's benefit  determination on review, shall be transmitted between the plan and the  claimant by telephone, facsimile, or other available similarly  expeditious method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Plans providing disability benefits. The claims procedures of a  plan providing disability benefits will not, with respect to claims for  such benefits, be deemed to provide a claimant with a reasonable  opportunity for a full and fair review of a claim and adverse benefit  determination unless the claims procedures comply with the requirements  of paragraphs (h)(2)(ii) through (iv) and (h)(3)(i) through (v) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em>, (i)(2), and  </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(3)</em> of this section, the plan administrator shall notify a claimant  in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section of the plan's benefit  determination on review within a reasonable period of time, but not  later than 60 days after receipt of the claimant's request for review by  the plan, unless the plan administrator determines that special  circumstances (such as the need to hold a hearing, if the plan's  procedures provide for a hearing) require an extension of time for  processing the claim. If the plan administrator determines that an  extension of time for processing is required, written notice of the  extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of  the initial 60-day period. In no event shall such extension exceed a  period of 60 days from the end of the initial period. The extension  notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension  of time and the date by which the plan expects to render the  determination on review.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a plan with a committee or board of trustees  designated as the appropriate named fiduciary that holds regularly  scheduled meetings at least quarterly, paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this  section shall not apply, and, except as provided in paragraphs (i)(2)  and (i)(3) of this section, the appropriate named fiduciary shall  instead make a benefit determination no later than the date of the  meeting of the committee or board that immediately follows the plan's  receipt of a request for review, unless the request for review is filed  within 30 days preceding the date of such meeting. In such case, a  benefit determination may be made by no later than the date of the  second meeting following the plan's receipt of the request for review.  If special circumstances (such as the need to hold a hearing, if the  plan's procedures provide for a hearing) require a further extension of  time for processing, a benefit determination shall be rendered not later  than the third meeting of the committee or board following the plan's  receipt of the request for review. If such an extension of time for  review is required because of special circumstances, the plan  administrator shall provide the claimant with written notice of the  extension, describing the special circumstances and the date as of which  the benefit determination will be made, prior to the commencement   of the extension. The plan administrator shall notify the claimant, in  accordance with paragraph (j) of this section, of the benefit  determination as soon as possible, but not later than 5 days after the  benefit determination is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through  (iii), as appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Urgent care claims.

In the case of a pre-service claim, the  plan administrator shall notify the claimant, in accordance with  paragraph (j) of this section, of the plan's benefit determination on  review within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the medical  circumstances. In the case of a group health plan that provides for one  appeal of an adverse benefit determination, such notification shall be  provided not later than 30 days after receipt by the plan of the  claimant's request for review of an adverse benefit determination. In  the case of a group health plan that provides for two appeals of an  adverse determination, such notification shall be provided, with respect  to any one of such two appeals, not later than 15 days after receipt by  the plan of the claimant's request for review of the adverse  determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Post-service claims. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a post-service claim,  except as provided in paragraph (i)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the plan  administrator shall notify the claimant, in accordance with paragraph  (j) of this section, of the plan's benefit determination on review  within a reasonable period of time. In the case of a group health plan  that provides for one appeal of an adverse benefit determination, such  notification shall be provided not later than 60 days after receipt by  the plan of the claimant's request for review of an adverse benefit  determination. In the case of a group health plan that provides for two  appeals of an adverse determination, such notification shall be  provided, with respect to any one of such two appeals, not later than 30  days after receipt by the plan of the claimant's request for review of  the adverse determination.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a multiemployer plan with a committee or board of  trustees designated as the appropriate named fiduciary that holds  regularly scheduled meetings at least quarterly, paragraph  (i)(2)(iii)(A) of this section shall not apply, and the appropriate  named fiduciary shall instead make a benefit determination no later than  the date of the meeting of the committee or board that immediately  follows the plan's receipt of a request for review, unless the request  for review is filed within 30 days preceding the date of such meeting.

If such an  extension of time for review is required because of special  circumstances, the plan administrator shall notify the claimant in  writing of the extension, describing the special circumstances and the  date as of which the benefit determination will be made, prior to the  commencement of the extension.
