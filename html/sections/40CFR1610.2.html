A suspension shall be in writing, shall  state the grounds on which it is based, and shall advise the person  suspended of the right to appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An attorney suspended pursuant to this section may within ten  (10) days after issuance of the order file an appeal with the Board. The  appeal shall be in writing and state concisely, with supporting  argument, why the appellant believes the order was erroneous, either as  a matter of fact or law. If necessary for a full and fair consideration  of the facts, the Board as a whole may conduct further evidentiary  hearings, or may refer the matter to another presiding officer for  development of a record. Such presiding officer may be an attorney who  is a Member of the Board or is employed in the Office of General  Counsel, or an administrative law judge detailed from another agency  pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3344. If the Board refers the matter to a presiding  officer, unless the Board provides specific directions to the presiding  officer, that officer shall determine the procedure to be followed and  who shall present evidence, subject to applicable provisions of law.  Such hearing shall commence as soon as possible. If no appeal is taken  of a suspension, or, if the suspension is upheld at the conclusion of  the appeal, the presiding officer, or the Board, as appropriate, shall  notify the state bar(s) to which the attorney is admitted. Such  notification shall include copies of the order of suspension, and, if an  appeal was taken, briefs of the parties, and the decision of the Board.  [66 FR 17363, Mar. 30, 2001]</p>
