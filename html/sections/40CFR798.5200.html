                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The mouse visible specific locus test (MSLT) may be  used to detect and quantitate mutations in the germ line of a mammalian  species.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A visible specific locus mutation is a genetic  change that alters factors responsible for coat color and other visible  characteristics of certain mouse strains.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The germ line is the cells in the gonads of higher eukaryotes  which are the carriers of the genetic information for the species.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reference substances. Not applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Test method--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Principle. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The principle of the MSLT is to  cross individuals who differ with respect to the genes present at  certain specific loci, so that a genetic alteration involving the  standard gene at any one of these loci will produce an offspring  detectably different from the standard heterozygote. The genetic change  may be detectable by various means, depending on the loci chosen to be  marked.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Three variations of the method currently exist for detecting  newly arising point mutations in mouse germ cells:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The visible specific locus test using either 5 or 7 loci.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The biochemical specific locus test using up to 20 enzymes.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The test for mutations at histocompatibility loci.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Of the three tests, the visible specific locus test has been  most widely used in assessing genetic hazard due to environmental  agents. It is the method described in this guideline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Description. For technical reasons, males rather than females  are generally treated with the test agent. Treated males are then mated  to females which are genetically homozygous for certain specific visible  marker loci. Offspring are examined in the next generation for evidence  that a new mutation has arisen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Animal selection--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Species and strain. Mice shall be used as  the test species. Male mice shall be either  (C3Hx101)F1 or (101xC3H)F1  hybrids. Females shall be T stock virgins.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Age. Healthy sexually mature animals shall be used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Number. A decision on the minimum number of treated animals  should take into account the spontaneous variation of the biological  characterization being evaluated. Other considerations should include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The use of either historical or concurrent controls.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The power of the test.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The minimal rate of induction required.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The use of positive controls.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The level of significance desired.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Assignment to groups. Animals shall be randomized and assigned  to treatment and control groups.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Control groups--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Concurrent controls. The use of positive or  spontaneous controls is left to the discretion of the investigator.  However, any laboratory which has had no prior experience with the test  shall, at its first attempt, produce a negative control sample of 20,000  and a positive control, using 100 mg/kg 1-ethyl-nitrosourea, in a sample  of 5,000 offspring.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Historical controls. Long term, accumulated spontaneous control  data of 43/801,406 are available for comparative purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Test chemicals--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vehicle. When possible, test chemicals  should be dissolved or suspended in distilled water or isotonic saline  buffered appropriately, if needed, for stability. Water-insoluble  chemicals shall be dissolved or suspended in appropriate vehicles. The  vehicle used shall neither interfere with the test compound nor produce  major toxic effects. Fresh preparations of the test chemical should be  employed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Dose levels. Usually, only one dose level need be tested. This  should be the highest dose tolerated without toxic effects, provided  that any temporary sterility induced due to elimination of spermatagonia  is of only moderate duration, as determined by a return of males to  fertility within 80 days after treatment. For evaluation of dose- response, it is recommended that at least two dose levels be tested.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Route of administration. Acceptable routes of administration  include gavage, inhalation, admixture with food or water, and IP or IV  injections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Test performance--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Treatment and mating. Hybrid F1  (C3 Hx101 or 101xC3 H) male mice shall be treated  with the test substance and immediately mated to virgin T stock females.  Each treated male shall be mated to a fresh group of 2 to 4 virgin  females each week for 7 weeks, after which he shall be returned to the  first group of females and rotated through the seven sets of females  repeatedly. This mating schedule generally permits sampling of all  postspermatagonial stages of germ cell development during the first 7  weeks and rapid accumulation of data for exposed spermatagonial stem  cells thereafter. Repeated mating cycles should be conducted until the  entire spermatogonial cycle has been evaluated and enough offspring have  been obtained to meet the power criterion of the assay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examination of offspring. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Offspring may be examined at (or  soon after) birth but must be examined at about 3 weeks of age at which  time the numbers of mutant and nonmutant offspring in each litter shall  be recorded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Nonmutant progeny should be discarded. Mutant progeny shall be  subjected to genetic tests for verification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Data and report--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Treatment of results. Data shall be  presented in tabular form and shall permit independent   analysis of cell stage specific effects and dose dependent phenomena.  The data shall be recorded and analyzed in such a way that clusters of  identical mutations are clearly identified. The individual mutants  detected shall be thoroughly described. In addition, concurrent positive  and negative control data, if they are available, shall be tabulated so  that it is possible to differentiate between concurrent (when available)  and long-term accumulated mutation frequencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statistical evaluation. Data shall be evaluated by appropriate  statistical methods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interpretation of results. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There are several criteria for  determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically  significant dose-related increase in the number of specific locus  mutations. Another criterion may be based upon detection of a  reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at  least one of the test points.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A test substance which does not produce either a statistically  significant dose-related increase in the number of specific locus  mutations or a statistically significant and reproducible positive  response at any one of the test points is considered nonmutagenic in  this system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Both biological and statistical significance should be  considered together in the evaluation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Test evaluation. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Positive results in the MSLT indicate that  under the test conditions the test substance induces heritable gene  mutations in the test species.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the  test substance does not induce heritable gene mutations in the test  species.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Test report. In addition to the reporting requirements as  specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J, and paragraph (h) of this  section, the following specific information shall be reported:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Strain, age and weight of animals used, number of animals of  each sex in experimental and control groups.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Test chemical vehicle, doses used and rationale for dose  selection, toxicity data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Route and duration of exposure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Mating schedule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Time of examination for mutant progeny.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Criteria for scoring mutants.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Use of concurrent or negative controls.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Dose response relationship, if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> References. For additional background information on this test  guideline the following references should be consulted:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Russell, L.B., Shelby, P.B., von Halle, E., Sheridan, W.,  Valcovic, L.
