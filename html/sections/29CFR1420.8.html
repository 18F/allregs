                                Sec. 1420.8  FMCS deferral to parties' own private factfinding procedures.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Service will defer to the parties' own privately agreed to  factfinding procedure and decline to appoint a Board of Inquiry (BoI) as  long as the parties' own procedure meets certain conditions so as to  satisfy the   Service's responsibilities under the Act. The Service will decline to  appoint a BoI and leave the selection and appointment of a factfinder to  the parties to a dispute if both the parties have agreed in writing to  their own factfinding procedure which meets the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The factfinding procedure must be invoked automatically at a  specified time (for example, at contract expiration if no agreement is  reached).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It must provide a fixed and determinate method for selecting the  impartial factfinder(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It must provide that there can be no strike or lockout and no  changes in conditions of employment (except by mutual agreement) prior  to or during the factfinding procedure and for a period of at least  seven days after the factfinding is completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It must provide that the factfinder(s) will make a written  report to the parties, containing the findings of fact and the  recommendations of the factfinder(s) for settling the dispute, a copy of  which is sent to the Service. The parties to a dispute who have agreed  to such a factfinding procedure should jointly submit a copy of such  agreed upon procedure to the appropriate regional office of the Service  at as early a date as possible, but in any event prior to the  appointment of a BoI by the Service. See Sec. 1420.5(f) for the  addresses of the regional offices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Since the Service does not appoint the factfinder under  paragraph (a) of this section, the Service cannot pay for such  factfinder. In this respect, such deferral by the Service to the  parties' own factfinding procedure is different from the use of  stipulation agreements between the parties which give to the Service the  authority to select and appoint a factfinder at a later date than the  date by which a BoI would have to be appointed under the Act. Under such  stipulation agreements by which the parties give the Service authority  to appoint a factfinder at a later date, the Service can pay for the  factfinder. However, in the deferral to the parties' own factfinding  procedure, the parties choose their own factfinder and they pay for the  factfinder.</p>
