                                Sec.  653.104  Services to MSFW family members, farm labor contractors,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition to other requirements in this subpart, the following special requirements are established for services to MSFW family members, farm labor contractors and crew members. Except as provided at Sec. Sec.  653.103(e) and 653.105, no local office shall refer an MSFW family or crew unless each working member of the family or crew being referred, has filed either a full or partial application pursuant to Sec.  653.103(b) at a local office or has been issued a JS card in instances set forth in Sec.  653.103(h). Local offices may, upon request, provide general information, e.g., the types of crops in other areas, to farm labor contractors and family heads prior to the registration of all working members.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No local office shall accept an application from an individual for employment as a farm labor contractor or fill an agricultural job order submitted by a farm labor contractor (``FLC'') or farm labor contractor employee (``FLCE'') unless the FLC or FLCE shows or obtains a valid FLC certificate, or FLCE identification card where required by Federal law, and a valid State certification where required by State law. If a FLC or FLCE is temporarily without his or her valid FLC certificate or FLCE identification card the local office shall try to verify the existence of the valid certificate or identification card by telephoning the State central office and/or the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Administration regional office. The local office, however, shall not serve the FLC or FLCE until the existence of the valid certificate or identification card is verified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Local offices may refer workers to registered farm labor contractors who are employers provided that a valid job

order has been placed with the local office which clearly specifies all the terms and conditions of employment with the farm labor contractor shown as employer of record. Before a local office may refer workers to a farm labor contractor offering employment in another area of the State or in another State, one of two requirements must be met: Either a valid interstate clearance order from another State agency is on file in the office, or an intrastate order has been received from an office in another area of the State which is not within commuting distance of the office where the farm labor contractor is recruiting workers. Unless one of these conditions exists, the local office may only refer workers to a registered farm labor contractor who is an employer placing a local job order. Whenever the job order includes the provision of transportation, a FLC certificate authorizing transportation must be shown before workers are referred on the order.</p>
