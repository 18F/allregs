If a community water system serving 25 to 1,000 persons has no history  of total coliform contamination in its current configuration and a  sanitary survey conducted in the past five years shows that the system  is supplied solely by a protected groundwater source and is free of  sanitary defects, the State may reduce the monitoring frequency  specified above, except that in no case may the State reduce the  monitoring frequency to less than one sample per quarter. The State must  approve the reduced monitoring frequency in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The monitoring frequency for total coliforms for non-community  water systems is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A non-community water system using only ground water (except  ground water under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in  Sec.  141.2) and serving 1,000 persons or fewer must monitor each  calendar quarter that the system provides water to the public, except  that the State may reduce this monitoring frequency, in writing, if a  sanitary survey shows that the system is free of sanitary defects.  Beginning June 29, 1994, the State cannot reduce the monitoring  frequency for a non-community water system using only ground water  (except ground water under the direct influence of surface water, as  defined in Sec.  141.2) and serving 1,000 persons or fewer to less than  once/year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A non-community water system using only ground water (except  ground water under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in  Sec.  141.2) and serving more than 1,000 persons during any month must  monitor at the same frequency as a like-sized community water system, as  specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except the State may  reduce this monitoring frequency, in writing, for any month the system  serves 1,000 persons or fewer. The State cannot reduce the monitoring  frequency to less than once/year. For systems using ground water under  the direct influence of surface water, paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this  section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A non-community water system using surface water, in total or  in part, must monitor at the same frequency as a like-sized community  water system, as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section,  regardless of the number of persons it serves.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A non-community water system using ground water under the  direct influence of surface water, as defined in Sec.  141.2, must  monitor at the same frequency as a like-sized community water system, as  specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The system must begin  monitoring at this frequency beginning six months after the State  determines that the ground water is under the direct influence of  surface water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The public water system must collect samples at regular time  intervals throughout the month, except that a system which uses only  ground water (except ground water under the direct influence of surface  water, as defined in Sec.  141.2), and serves 4,900 persons or fewer,  may collect all required samples on a single day if they are taken from  different sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A public water system that uses surface water or ground water  under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in Sec.  141.2,  and does not practice filtration in compliance with Subpart H must  collect at least one sample near the first service connection each day  the turbidity level of the source water, measured as specified in Sec.   141.74(b)(2), exceeds 1 NTU. This sample must be analyzed for the  presence of total coliforms. When one or more turbidity measurements in  any day exceed 1 NTU, the system must collect this coliform sample  within 24 hours of the first exceedance, unless the State determines  that the system, for logistical reasons outside the system's control,  cannot have the sample analyzed within 30 hours of collection. Sample  results from this coliform monitoring must be included in determining  compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in Sec.  141.63.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special purpose samples, such as those taken to determine  whether disinfection practices are sufficient following pipe placement,  replacement, or repair, shall not be used to determine compliance with  the MCL for total coliforms in Sec.  141.63. Repeat samples taken  pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section are not considered special  purpose samples, and must be used to determine compliance with the MCL  for total coliforms in Sec.  141.63.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Repeat monitoring. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a routine sample is total coliform- positive, the public water system must collect a set of repeat samples  within 24 hours of being notified of the positive result. A system which  collects more than one routine sample/month must collect no fewer than  three repeat samples for each total coliform-positive sample found. A  system which collects one routine sample/month or fewer must collect no  fewer than four repeat samples for each total coliform-positive sample  found. The State may extend the 24-hour limit on a case-by-case basis if  the system has a logistical   problem in collecting the repeat samples within 24 hours that is beyond  its control. In the case of an extension, the State must specify how  much time the system has to collect the repeat samples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The system must collect at least one repeat sample from the  sampling tap where the original total coliform-positive sample was  taken, and at least one repeat sample at a tap within five service  connections upstream and at least one repeat sample at a tap within five  service connections downstream of the original sampling site. If a total  coliform-positive sample is at the end of the distribution system, or  one away from the end of the distribution system, the State may waive  the requirement to collect at least one repeat sample upstream or  downstream of the original sampling site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The system must collect all repeat samples on the same day,  except that the State may allow a system with a single service  connection to collect the required set of repeat samples over a four-day  period or to collect a larger volume repeat sample(s) in one or more  sample containers of any size, as long as the total volume collected is  at least 400 ml (300 ml for systems which collect more than one routine  sample/month).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If one or more repeat samples in the set is total coliform- positive, the public water system must collect an additional set of  repeat samples in the manner specified in paragraphs (b) (1)-(3) of this  section. The additional samples must be collected within 24 hours of  being notified of the positive result, unless the State extends the  limit as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The system must  repeat this process until either total coliforms are not detected in one  complete set of repeat samples or the system determines that the MCL for  total coliforms in Sec.  141.63 has been exceeded and notifies the  State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> (i) or (ii) of this  section are met. The State cannot waive the requirement for a system to  collect repeat samples in paragraphs (b) (1)-(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State may waive the requirement to collect five routine  samples the next month the system provides water to the public if the  State, or an agent approved by the State, performs a site visit before  the end of the next month the system provides water to the public.  Although a sanitary survey need not be performed, the site visit must be  sufficiently detailed to allow the State to determine whether additional  monitoring and/or any corrective action is needed. The State cannot  approve an employee of the system to perform this site visit, even if  the employee is an agent approved by the State to perform sanitary  surveys.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State may waive the requirement to collect five routine  samples the next month the system provides water to the public if the  State has determined why the sample was total coliform-positive and  establishes that the system has corrected the problem or will correct  the problem before the end of the next month the system serves water to  the public. In this case, the State must document this decision to waive  the following month's additional monitoring requirement in writing, have  it approved and signed by the supervisor of the State official who  recommends such a decision, and make this document available to the EPA  and public. The written documentation must describe the specific cause  of the total coliform-positive sample and what action the system has  taken and/or will take to correct this problem. The State cannot waive  the requirement to collect five routine samples the next month the  system provides water to the public solely on the grounds that all  repeat samples are total coliform-negative. Under this paragraph, a  system must still take at least one routine sample before the end of the  next month it serves water to the public and use it to determine  compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in Sec.  141.63, unless the  State has   determined that the system has corrected the contamination problem  before the system took the set of repeat samples required in paragraphs  (b) (1)-(4) of this section, and all repeat samples were total coliform- negative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> After a system collects a routine sample and before it learns  the results of the analysis of that sample, if it collects another  routine sample(s) from within five adjacent service connections of the  initial sample, and the initial sample, after analysis, is found to  contain total coliforms, then the system may count the subsequent  sample(s) as a repeat sample instead of as a routine sample.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Results of all routine and repeat samples not invalidated by the  State must be included in determining compliance with the MCL for total  coliforms in Sec.  141.63.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> does not count  towards meeting the minimum monitoring requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> (i), (ii), or (iii) of this  section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis caused  the total coliform-positive result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State, on the basis of the results of repeat samples  collected as required by paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) of this section,  determines that the total coliform-positive sample resulted from a  domestic or other non-distribution system plumbing problem. The State  cannot invalidate a sample on the basis of repeat sample results unless  all repeat sample(s) collected at the same tap as the original total  coliform-positive sample are also total coliform-positive, and all  repeat samples collected within five service connections of the original  tap are total coliform-negative (e.g., a State cannot invalidate a total  coliform-positive sample on the basis of repeat samples if all the  repeat samples are total coliform-negative, or if the public water  system has only one service connection).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The State has substantial grounds to believe that a total  coliform-positive result is due to a circumstance or condition which  does not reflect water quality in the distribution system. In this case,  the system must still collect all repeat samples required under  paragraphs (b) (1)-(4) of this section, and use them to determine  compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in Sec.  141.63. To  invalidate a total coliform-positive sample under this paragraph, the  decision with the rationale for the decision must be documented in  writing, and approved and signed by the supervisor of the State official  who recommended the decision. The State must make this document  available to EPA and the public. The written documentation must state  the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample, and what  action the system has taken, or will take, to correct this problem. The  State may not invalidate a total coliform-positive sample solely on the  grounds that all repeat samples are total coliform-negative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A laboratory must invalidate a total coliform sample (unless  total coliforms are detected) if the sample produces a turbid culture in  the absence of gas production using an analytical method where gas  formation is examined (e.g., the Multiple-Tube Fermentation Technique),  produces a turbid culture in the absence of an acid reaction in the  Presence-Absence (P-A) Coliform Test, or exhibits confluent growth or  produces colonies too numerous to count with an analytical method using  a membrane filter (e.g., Membrane Filter Technique). If a laboratory  invalidates a sample because of such interference, the system must  collect another sample from the same location as the original sample  within 24 hours of being notified of the interference problem, and have  it analyzed for the presence of total coliforms. The system must  continue to re-sample within 24 hours and have the samples analyzed  until it obtains a valid result. The State may waive the 24-hour time  limit on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Sanitary surveys. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Public water systems which do not  collect five or more routine samples/month must undergo an initial  sanitary survey by June 29, 1994, for community public water systems and  June 29, 1999, for   non-community water systems. Thereafter, systems must undergo another  sanitary survey every five years, except that non-community water  systems using only protected and disinfected ground water, as defined by  the State, must undergo subsequent sanitary surveys at least every ten  years after the initial sanitary survey. The State must review the  results of each sanitary survey to determine whether the existing  monitoring frequency is adequate and what additional measures, if any,  the system needs to undertake to improve drinking water quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In conducting a sanitary survey of a system using ground water  in a State having an EPA-approved wellhead protection program under  section 1428 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, information on sources of  contamination within the delineated wellhead protection area that was  collected in the course of developing and implementing the program  should be considered instead of collecting new information, if the  information was collected since the last time the system was subject to  a sanitary survey.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sanitary surveys must be performed by the State or an agent  approved by the State. The system is responsible for ensuring the survey  takes place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sanitary surveys conducted by the State under the provisions of  Sec.  142.16(o)(2) of this chapter may be used to meet the sanitary  survey requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Fecal coliforms/Escherichia coli (E. coli) testing. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If any  routine or repeat sample is total coliform-positive, the system must  analyze that total coliform-positive culture medium to determine if  fecal coliforms are present, except that the system may test for E. coli  in lieu of fecal coliforms. If fecal coliforms or E. coli are present,  the system must notify the State by the end of the day when the system  is notified of the test result, unless the system is notified of the  result after the State office is closed, in which case the system must  notify the State before the end of the next business day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State has the discretion to allow a public water system, on  a case-by-case basis, to forgo fecal coliform or E. coli testing on a  total coliform-positive sample if that system assumes that the total  coliform-positive sample is fecal coliform-positive or E. coli-positive.  Accordingly, the system must notify the State as specified in paragraph  (e)(1) of this section and the provisions of Sec.  141.63(b) apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Analytical methodology. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The standard sample volume required  for total coliform analysis, regardless of analytical method used, is  100 ml.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Public water systems need only determine the presence or absence  of total coliforms; a determination of total coliform density is not  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Public water systems must conduct total coliform analyses in  accordance with one of the analytical methods in the following table or  one of the alternative methods listed in appendix A to subpart C of this  part.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Organism                             Methodology \12\                       Citation \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Coliforms \2\...................

EPA also encourages laboratories to establish false-positive and</p><p class="depth0">false-negative rates within their own laboratory and sample matrix (drinking water or source water) with the</p><p class="depth0">intent that if the method they choose has an unacceptable false-positive or negative rate, another method can</p><p class="depth0">be used. The Agency suggests that laboratories perform these studies on a minimum of 5% of all total coliform-</p><p class="depth0">positive samples, except for those methods where verification/confirmation is already required, e.g., the M-</p><p class="depth0">Endo and LES Endo Membrane Filter Tests, Standard Total Coliform Fermentation Technique, and Presence-Absence</p><p class="depth0">Coliform Test.

When the MTF Technique or  Presence-Absence (PA) Coliform Test is used to test for total coliforms,  shake the lactose-positive presumptive tube or P-A vigorously and  transfer the growth with a sterile 3-mm loop or sterile applicator stick  into brilliant green lactose bile broth and EC medium to determine the  presence of total and fecal coliforms, respectively. For EPA-approved  analytical methods which use a membrane filter, transfer the total  coliform-positive culture by one of the following methods: remove the  membrane containing the total coliform colonies from the substrate with  a sterile forceps and carefully curl and insert the membrane into a tube  of EC medium (the laboratory may first remove a small portion of  selected colonies for verification), swab the entire membrane filter  surface with a sterile cotton swab and transfer the inoculum to EC  medium (do not leave the cotton swab in the EC medium), or inoculate  individual total coliform-positive colonies into EC Medium. Gently shake  the inoculated tubes of EC medium to insure adequate mixing and incubate  in a waterbath at 44.5 0.2 [deg]C for 24 2 hours. Gas production of any amount in the inner  fermentation tube of the EC medium indicates a positive fecal coliform  test. The preparation of EC medium is described in Method 9221E  (paragraph 1a) in Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and  Wastewater, 18th edition (1992), 19th edition (1995), and 20th edition  (1998); the cited method in any one of these three editions may be used.  Public water systems need only determine the presence or absence of  fecal coliforms; a determination of fecal coliform density is not  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Public water systems must conduct analysis of Escherichia coli  in accordance with one of the following analytical methods or one of the  alternative methods listed in appendix A to subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> EC medium supplemented with 50 [micro]g/mL of 4- methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide (MUG) (final concentration), as  described in Method 9222G in Standard Methods for the Examination of  Water and Wastewater, 19th edition (1995) and 20th edition (1998).  Either edition may be used. Alternatively, the 18th edition (1992) may  be used if at least 10 mL of EC medium, as described in paragraph (f)(5)  of this section, is supplemented with 50 [micro]g/mL of MUG before  autoclaving. The inner inverted fermentation tube may be omitted. If the  18th edition is used, apply the procedure in paragraph (f)(5) of this  section for transferring a total coliform-positive culture to EC medium  supplemented with MUG, incubate the tube at 44.5 0.2 [deg]C for 24 2 hours, and  then observe fluorescence with an ultraviolet light (366 nm) in the  dark. If fluorescence is visible, E. coli are present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nutrient agar supplemented with 100 [micro]g/mL of 4- methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide (MUG) (final concentration), as  described in Method 9222G in Standard Methods for the Examination of  Water and Wastewater, 19th edition (1995) and 20th edition (1998).  Either edition may be used for determining if a total coliform-positive  sample, as determined by a membrane filter technique, contains E. coli.  Alternatively, the 18th edition (1992) may be used if the membrane  filter containing a total coliform-positive colony(ies) is transferred  to nutrient agar, as described in Method 9221B (paragraph 3) of Standard  Methods (18th edition), supplemented with 100 [micro]g/mL of MUG. If the  18th edition is used, incubate the agar plate at 35 [deg]C for 4 hours  and then observe the colony(ies) under ultraviolet light (366 nm) in the  dark for fluorescence. If fluorescence is visible, E. coli are present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Minimal Medium ONPG-MUG (MMO-MUG) Test, as set forth in the  article ``National Field Evaluation of a Defined Substrate Method for  the Simultaneous Detection of Total Coliforms and Escherichia coli from  Drinking Water: Comparison with Presence-Absence Techniques'' (Edberg et  al.), Applied and Environmental Microbiology, Volume 55, pp. 1003-1008,  April 1989. (Note: The Autoanalysis Colilert System is an MMO-MUG test).  If the MMO-MUG test is total coliform-positive after a 24-hour  incubation, test the medium for fluorescence with a 366-nm ultraviolet  light (preferably with a 6-watt lamp) in the dark. If fluorescence is  observed, the sample is E. coli-positive. If fluorescence is  questionable (cannot be definitively read) after 24 hours incubation,  incubate the culture for an additional four hours (but not to exceed 28  hours total), and again test the medium for fluorescence. The MMO-MUG  Test with hepes buffer in lieu of phosphate buffer is the only approved  formulation for the detection of E. coli.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Colisure Test.
