                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a condition of obtaining and retaining market-based rate authority, a Seller must timely report to the Commission any change in status that would reflect a departure from the characteristics the Commission relied upon in granting market-based rate authority. A change in status includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ownership or control of generation capacity or long-term firm purchases of capacity and/or energy that results in cumulative net increases (i.e., the difference between increases and decreases in affiliated generation capacity) of 100 MW or more of nameplate capacity in any individual relevant geographic market, or of inputs

to electric power production, or ownership, operation or control of transmission facilities; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Affiliation with any entity not disclosed in the application for market-based rate authority that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Owns or controls generation facilities or has long-term firm purchases of capacity and/or energy that results in cumulative net increases (i.e., the difference between increases and decreases in affiliated generation capacity) of 100 MW or more of capacity based on nameplate or seasonal capacity ratings, or, for energy-limited resources, five-year average capacity factors, in any individual relevant geographic market;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Owns or controls inputs to electric power production;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Owns, operates or controls transmission facilities; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Has a franchised service area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any change in status subject to paragraph (a) of this section must be filed no later than 30 days after the change in status occurs. Power sales contracts with future delivery are reportable 30 days after the physical delivery has begun. Failure to timely file a change in status report constitutes a tariff violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When submitting a change in status notification regarding a change that impacts the pertinent assets held by a Seller or its affiliates with market-based rate authorization, a Seller must include an appendix of all assets, including the new assets and/or affiliates reported in the change in status, in the form provided in appendix B of this subpart, and an organizational chart. The organizational chart must depict the Seller's prior and new corporate structures indicating all affiliates unless the Seller demonstrates that the change in status does not affect the corporate structure of the Seller's affiliations.
