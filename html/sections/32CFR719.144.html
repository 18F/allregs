                            </h3>

If such a case is considered upon application of the accused, the application must be filed in the Office of the Judge Advocate General by the accused on or before the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date the sentence is approved under section 860(c) of this title (article 60(c)), unless the accused establishes good cause for failure to file within that time.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time limitations. In order to be considered by the Judge Advocate General, an application for relief must be placed in military channels if the applicant is on active duty, or be deposited in the mail if the applicant is no longer on active duty, on or before the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date the sentence is approved by the convening authority. An application not filed in compliance with these time limits may be considered if the Judge Advocate General determines, in his or her sole discretion, that ``good cause'' for failure to file within the time limits has been established by the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Submission procedures. Applications for relief may be submitted to the Judge Advocate General by letter. If the accused is on active duty, the application shall be submitted via the applicant's commanding officer, and the command that convened the court, and the command that reviewed the case under 10 U.S.C. 864(a) or (b). If the original record of trail is held by the command that reviewed the case under 10 U.S.C. 864(a) or (b), it shall be forwarded as an enclosure to the endorsement. If the original record of trial has been filed in the National Personnel Records Center, the endorsement will include all necessary retrieval data (accession number, box number, and shelf location) obtained from the receipt returned from the National Personnel Records Center to the sending activity. This endorsement shall also include information and specific comment on the grounds for relief asserted in the application, and an opinion on

the merits of the application. If the applicant is no longer on active duty, the application may be submitted directly to the Judge Advocate General.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contents of applications. All applications for relief shall contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Full name of the applicant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Social Security number and branch of service, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Present grade if on active duty or retired, or ``civilian'' or ``deceased'' as applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Address at time the application is forwarded;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Date of trial;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Place of trial;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Command title of the organization at which the court-martial was convened (convening authority);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Command title of the officer exercising review authority in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 864 over the applicant at the time of trial, if applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Type of court-martial which convicted the applicant, and sentence adjudged;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> General grounds for relief which must be one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Newly discovered evidence;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fraud on the court;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Lack of jurisdiction over the accused or the offense;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Error prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Appropriateness of the sentence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> An elaboration of the specific prejudice resulting from any error cited. (Legal authorities to support the applicant's contentions may be included, and the format used may take the form of a legal brief if the applicant so desires.);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Any other matter which the applicant desires to submit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Relief requested; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Facts and circumstances to establish ``good cause'' for a failure to file the application within the time limits prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, if applicable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> If the application is signed by a person other than the applicant pursuant to subsection e, an explanation of the circumstances rendering the applicant incapable of making application. The applicant's copy of the record of trial will not be forwarded with the application for relief, unless specifically requested by the Judge Advocate General.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Signatures on applications. Unless incapable of making application, the applicant shall personally sign the application under oath before an official authorized to administer oaths. If the applicant is incapable of making application, the application may be signed under oath and submitted by the applicant's spouse, next of kin, executor, guardian or other person with a proper interest in the matter.
