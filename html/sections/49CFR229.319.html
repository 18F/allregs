A performance criterion is  deemed to be met if, after undergoing a test established in this  appendix D for that criterion, the ERMM has preserved all of the data  stored in it. The data set stored in the ERMM to be tested shall include  all the recording elements required by Sec. 229.135(b).

FRA will consider a performance  criterion not to be potentially affected if a preliminary engineering  analysis or other pertinent data establishes that the modification or  upgrade will not change the performance of the older model ERMM against  the performance criterion in question.

Appendix F to Part 229--Recommended Practices for Design and Safety</p><p class="depth0">Analysis</p><p class="depth0">The purpose of this appendix is to provide recommended criteria for  design and safety analysis that will maximize the safety of electronic  locomotive control systems and mitigate potential negative safety  effects. It seeks to promote full disclosure of potential safety risks  to facilitate minimizing or eliminating elements of risk where  practicable. It discuses critical elements of good engineering practice  that the designer should consider when developing safety critical  electronic locomotive control systems to accomplish this objective. The  criteria and processes specified this appendix is intended to minimize  the probability of failure to an acceptable level within the limitations  of the available engineering science, cost, and other constraints.  Railroads procuring safety critical electronic locomotive controls are  encouraged to ensure that their vendor addresses each of the elements of  this appendix in the design of the product being procured. FRA uses the  criteria and processes set forth in this appendix (or other technically  equivalent criteria and processes that may be recommended by industry)  when evaluating analyses, assumptions, and conclusions provided in the  SA documents.</p><p class="depth0">Definitions</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the definitions contained in Sec. 229.305, the  following definitions are applicable to this Appendix:</p><p class="depth0">Hazard means an existing or potential condition that can result in  an accident.</p><p class="depth0">High degree of confidence, as applied to the highest level of  aggregation, means there exists credible safety analysis supporting the  conclusion that the risks associated with the product have been  adequately mitigated.</p><p class="depth0">Human factors refers to a body of knowledge about human limitations,  human abilities, and other human characteristics, such as behavior and  motivation, that shall be considered in product design.</p><p class="depth0">Human-machine interface (HMI) means the interrelated set of controls  and displays that allows humans to interact with the machine.</p><p class="depth0">Risk means the expected probability of occurrence for an individual  accident event (probability) multiplied by the severity of   the expected consequences associated with the accident (severity).</p><p class="depth0">Risk assessment means the process of determining, either  quantitatively or qualitatively, the measure of risk associated with use  of the product under all intended operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0">System Safety Precedence means the order of precedence in which  methods used to eliminate or control identified hazards within a system  are implemented.</p><p class="depth0">Validation means the process of determining whether a product's  design requirements fulfill its intended design objectives during its  development and life-cycle. The goal of the validation process is to  determine ``whether the correct product was built.''</p><p class="depth0">Verification means the process of determining whether the results of  a given phase of the development cycle fulfill the validated  requirements established at the start of that phase. The goal of the  verification process is to determine ``whether the product was built  correctly.''</p><p class="depth0">Safety Assessments--Recommended Contents</p><p class="depth0">The safety-critical assessment of each product should include all of  its interconnected subsystems and components and, where applicable, the  interaction between such subsystems. FRA recommends that such  assessments contain the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A complete description of the product, including a list of all  product components and their physical relationship in the subsystem or  system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A description of the railroad operation or categories of  operations on which the product is designed to be used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An operational concepts document, including a complete  description of the product functionality and information flows; as well  as identifying which functions are intended to enhance or preserve  safety and the manner in which the product architecture implements these  functions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A safety requirements document, including a list with complete  descriptions of all functions, which the product performs to enhance or  preserve safety, and that describes the manner in which product  architecture satisfies safety requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A hazard log consisting of a comprehensive description of all  safety relevant hazards addressed during the life cycle of the product,  including maximum threshold limits for each hazard (for unidentified  hazards, the threshold shall be exceeded at one occurrence);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> A risk assessment and analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The risk metric for the proposed product should describe with a  high degree of confidence the accumulated risk of a locomotive control  system that operates over the intended product life. Each risk metric  for the proposed product should be expressed with an upper bound, as  estimated with a sensitivity analysis, and the risk value selected is  demonstrated to have a high degree of confidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each risk calculation should consider the totality of the  locomotive control system and its method of operation. The failure modes  of each subsystem or component, or both, should be determined for the  integrated hardware/software (where applicable) as a function of the  Mean Time to Hazardous Events (MTTHE), failure restoration rates, and  the integrated hardware/software coverage of all processor based  subsystems or components, or both. Train operating and movement rules,  along with components that are layered in order to enhance safety- critical behavior, should also be considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An MTTHE value should be calculated for each subsystem or  component, or both, indicating the safety-critical behavior of the  integrated hardware/software subsystem or component, or both. The human  factor impact should be included in the assessment, whenever applicable,  to provide an integrated MTTHE value. The MTTHE calculation should  consider the rates of failures caused by permanent, transient, and  intermittent faults accounting for the fault coverage of the integrated  hardware/software subsystem or component, phased-interval maintenance,  and restoration of the detected failures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The analysis should clearly document:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any assumptions regarding the reliability or availability of  mechanical, electric, or electronic components. Such assumptions include  MTTF projections, as well as Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) projections,  unless the risk assessment specifically explains why these assumptions  are not relevant. The analysis should document these assumptions in such  a form as to permit later comparisons with in-service experience (e.g.,  a spreadsheet). The analysis should also document any assumptions  regarding human performance. The documentation should be in a form that  facilitates later comparisons with in-service experience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any assumptions regarding software defects. These assumptions  should be in a form which permits the railroad to project the likelihood  of detecting an in-service software defect and later comparisons with  in-service experience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All of the identified safety-critical fault paths leading to a  mishap as predicted by the SA. The documentation should be in a form  that facilitates later comparisons with in-service faults.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> MTTHE compliance verification and validation should be based on  the assessment of the design for verification and validation process,  historical performance data, analytical methods and experimental safety  critical performance testing performed on the subsystem or component.  The compliance   process shall be demonstrated to be compliant and consistent with the  MTTHE metric and demonstrated to have a high degree of confidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The safety-critical behavior of all non-processor based  components, which are part of a processor-based system or subsystem,  should be quantified with an MTTHE metric. The MTTHE assessment  methodology should consider failures caused by permanent, transient, and  intermittent faults, phase interval maintenance and restoration of  failures and the effect of fault coverage of each non-processor-based  subsystem or component. The MTTHE compliance verification and validation  should be based on the assessment of the design for verification and  validation process, historical performance data, analytical methods and  experimental safety critical performance testing performed on the  subsystem or component. The non-processor based quantification  compliance should also be demonstrated to have a high degree of  confidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> A hazard mitigation analysis, including a complete and  comprehensive description of all hazards to be addressed in the system  design and development, mitigation techniques used, and system safety  precedence followed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> A complete description of the safety assessment and verification  and validation processes applied to the product and the results of these  processes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A complete description of the safety assurance concepts used in  the product design, including an explanation of the design principles  and assumptions; the designer should address each of the following  safety considerations when designing and demonstrating the safety of  products covered by this part. In the event that any of these principles  are not followed, the analysis should describe both the reason(s) for  departure and the alternative(s) utilized to mitigate or eliminate the  hazards associated with the design principle not followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Normal operation. The system (including all hardware and  software) should demonstrate safe operation with no hardware failures  under normal anticipated operating conditions with proper inputs and  within the expected range of environmental conditions. All safety- critical functions should be performed properly under these normal  conditions. Absence of specific operator actions or procedures will not  prevent the system from operating safely. Hazards categorized as  unacceptable should be eliminated by design. Best effort should also be  made by the designer to eliminate hazards that are undesirable. Those  undesirable hazards that cannot be eliminated must be mitigated to an  acceptable level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Systematic failure. It should be shown how the product is  designed to mitigate or eliminate unsafe systematic failures--those  conditions which can be attributed to human error that could occur at  various stages throughout product development. This includes unsafe  errors in the software due to human error in the software specification,  design or coding phase, or both; human errors that could impact hardware  design; unsafe conditions that could occur because of an improperly  designed human-machine interface; installation and maintenance errors;  and errors associated with making modifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Random failure. The product should be shown to operate safely  under conditions of random hardware failure. This includes single as  well as multiple hardware failures, particularly in instances where one  or more failures could occur, remain undetected (latent) and react in  combination with a subsequent failure at a later time to cause an unsafe  operating situation. In instances involving a latent failure, a  subsequent failure is similar to there being a single failure. In the  event of a transient failure, and if so designed, the system should  restart itself if it is safe to do so. Frequency of attempted restarts  should be considered in the hazard analysis. There should be no single  point failures in the product that can result in hazards categorized as  unacceptable or undesirable. Occurrence of credible single point  failures that can result in hazards shall be detected and the product  shall be detected and the product should achieve a known state that  eliminates the possibility of false activation of any physical  appliance. If one non-self-revealing failure combined with a second  failure can cause a hazard that is categorized as unacceptable or  undesirable, then the second failure should be detected and the product  must achieve a known safe state that eliminates the possibility of false  activation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Common Mode failure. Another concern of multiple failures  involves common mode failure in which two or more subsystems or  components intended to compensate one another to perform the same  function all fail by the same mode and result in unsafe conditions. This  is of particular concern in instances in which two or more elements  (hardware or software, or both) are used in combination to ensure  safety. If a common mode failure exists, then any analysis cannot rely  on the assumption that failures are independent. Examples include: the  use of redundancy in which two or more elements perform a given function  in parallel and when one (hardware or software) element checks/monitors  another element (of hardware or software) to help ensure its safe  operation. Common mode failure relates to independence, which shall be  ensured in these instances. When dealing with the effects of hardware  failure, the designer should address the effects of the failure not only  on other hardware, but also on the execution of   the software, since hardware failures can greatly affect how the  software operates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> External influences. The product should operate safely when  subjected to different external influences, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Electrical influences such as power supply anomalies/transients,  abnormal/improper input conditions (e.g., outside of normal range inputs  relative to amplitude and frequency, unusual combinations of inputs)  including those related to a human operator, and others such as  electromagnetic interference or electrostatic discharges, or both;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Mechanical influences such as vibration and shock; and climatic  conditions such as temperature and humidity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Modifications. Safety must be ensured following modifications to  the hardware or software, or both. All or some of the concerns  previously identified may be applicable depending upon the nature and  extent of the modifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Software. Software faults should not cause hazards categorized  as unacceptable or undesirable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Closed Loop Principle. The product design should require  positive action to be taken in a prescribed manner to either begin  product operation or continue product operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> A human factors analysis, including a complete description of  all human-machine interfaces, a complete description of all functions  performed by humans in connection with the product to enhance or  preserve safety, and an analysis of the physical ergonomics of the  product on the operators and the safe operation of the system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> A complete description of the specific training of railroad and  contractor employees and supervisors necessary to ensure the safe and  proper installation, implementation, operation, maintenance, repair,  inspection, testing, and modification of the product;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> A complete description of the specific procedures and test  equipment necessary to ensure the safe and proper installation,  implementation, operation, maintenance, repair, inspection, test, and  modification of the product. These procedures, including calibration  requirements, should be consistent with or explain deviations from the  equipment manufacturer's recommendations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> A complete description of the necessary security measures for  the product over its life-cycle;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> A complete description of each warning to be placed in the  Operations and Maintenance Manual and of all warning labels required to  be placed on equipment as necessary to ensure safety;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> A complete description of all initial implementation testing  procedures necessary to establish that safety-functional requirements  are met and safety-critical hazards are appropriately mitigated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> A complete description of all post-implementation testing  (validation) and monitoring procedures, including the intervals  necessary to establish that safety-functional requirements, safety- critical hazard mitigation processes, and safety-critical tolerances are  not compromised over time, through use, or after maintenance (repair,  replacement, adjustment) is performed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> A complete description of each record necessary to ensure the  safety of the system that is associated with periodic maintenance,  inspections, tests, repairs, replacements, adjustments, and the system's  resulting conditions, including records of component failures resulting  in safety relevant hazards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> A complete description of any safety-critical assumptions  regarding availability of the product, and a complete description of all  backup methods of operation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(s)</em> The configuration/revision control measures designed to ensure  that safety-functional requirements and safety-critical hazard  mitigation processes are not compromised as a result of any change.  Changes classified as maintenance require validation.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance Regarding the Application of Human Factors in the Design of</p><p class="depth0">Products</p><p class="depth0">The product design should sufficiently incorporate human factors  engineering that is appropriate to the complexity of the product; the  gender, educational, mental, and physical capabilities of the intended  operators and maintainers; the degree of required human interaction with  the component; and the environment in which the product will be used.  HMI design criteria minimize negative safety effects by causing  designers to consider human factors in the development of HMIs. As used  in this discussion, ``designer'' means anyone who specifies requirements  for--or designs a system or subsystem, or both, for--a product subject  to this part, and ``operator'' means any human who is intended to  receive information from, provide information to, or perform repairs or  maintenance on a safety critical locomotive control product subject to  this part.</p><p class="depth0">I. FRA recommends that system designers should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Design systems that anticipate possible user errors and include  capabilities to catch errors before they propagate through the system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conduct cognitive task analyses prior to designing the system to  better understand the information processing requirements of operators  when making critical decisions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Present information that accurately represents or predicts  system states; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Ensure that electronics equipment radio frequency emissions are  compliant with appropriate Federal Communications   Commission (FCC) regulations.

This document has  been prepared to provide a basic understanding of the FCC regulations  for digital (computing) devices, and includes answers to some commonly- asked questions.</p><p class="depth0">II. Human factors issues designers should consider with regard to  the general functioning of a system include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reduced situational awareness and over-reliance. HMI design  shall give an operator active functions to perform, feedback on the  results of the operator's actions, and information on the automatic  functions of the system as well as its performance. The operator shall  be ``in-the loop.'' Designers should consider at minimum the following  methods of maintaining an active role for human operators:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The system should require an operator to initiate action to  operate the train and require an operator to remain ``in-the-loop'' for  at least 30 minutes at a time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The system should provide timely feedback to an operator  regarding the system's automated actions, the reasons for such actions,  and the effects of the operator's manual actions on the system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The system should warn operators in advance when they require an  operator to take action;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> HMI design should equalize an operator's workload; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> HMI design should not distract from the operator's safety  related duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Expectation of predictability and consistency in product  behavior and communications. HMI design should accommodate an operator's  expectation of logical and consistent relationships between actions and  results. Similar objects should behave consistently when an operator  performs the same action upon them. End users have a limited memory and  ability to process information. Therefore, HMI design should also  minimize an operator's information processing load.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To minimize information processing load, the designer should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Present integrated information that directly supports the  variety and types of decisions that an operator makes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provide information in a format or representation that  minimizes the time required to understand and act; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Conduct utility tests of decision aids to establish clear  benefits such as processing time saved or improved quality of decisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To minimize short-term memory load, the designer should  integrate data or information from multiple sources into a single format  or representation (``chunking'') and design so that three or fewer  ``chunks'' of information need to be remembered at any one time. To  minimize long-term memory load, the designer should design to support  recognition memory, design memory aids to minimize the amount of  information that should be recalled from unaided memory when making  critical decisions, and promote active processing of the information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When creating displays and controls, the designer shall consider  user ergonomics and should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Locate displays as close as possible to the controls that affect  them;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Locate displays and controls based on an operator's position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Arrange controls to minimize the need for the operator to  change position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Arrange controls according to their expected order of use;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Group similar controls together;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Design for high stimulus-response compatibility (geometric and  conceptual);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Design safety-critical controls to require more than one  positive action to activate (e.g., auto stick shift requires two  movements to go into reverse);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Design controls to allow easy recovery from error; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Design display and controls to reflect specific gender and  physical limitations of the intended operators.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Detailed locomotive ergonomics human machine interface guidance  may be found in ``Human Factors Guidelines for Locomotive Cabs'' (FRA/ ORD-98/03 or DOT-VNTSC-FRA-98-8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The designer should also address information management. To that  end, HMI design should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Display information in a manner which emphasizes its relative  importance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Comply with the ANSI/HFS 100-2007, or more recent standard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Utilize a display luminance that has a difference of at least  35cd/m2 between the foreground and background (the displays should be  capable of a minimum contrast 3:1 with 7:1 preferred, and controls  should be provided to adjust the brightness level and contrast level);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Display only the information necessary to the user;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Where text is needed, use short, simple sentences or phrases  with wording that an operator will understand and appropriate to the  educational and cognitive capabilities of the intended operator;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Use complete words where possible; where abbreviations are  necessary, choose a commonly accepted abbreviation or consistent method  and select commonly used terms and words that the operator will  understand;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Adopt a consistent format for all display screens by placing  each design element in a consistent and specified location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Display critical information in the center of the operator's  field of view by placing items that need to be found quickly in the  upper left hand corner and items which are not time-critical in the  lower right hand corner of the field of view;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Group items that belong together;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Design all visual displays to meet human performance criteria  under monochrome conditions and add color only if it will help the user  in performing a task, and use color coding as a redundant coding  technique;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Limit the number of colors over a group of displays to no more  than seven;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Design warnings to match the level of risk or danger with the  alerting nature of the signal; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> With respect to information entry, avoid full QWERTY  keyboards for data entry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> With respect to problem management, the HMI designer should  ensure that the HMI design:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> enhances an operator's situation awareness;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> supports response selection and scheduling; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> supports contingency planning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Designers should comply with FCC requirements for Maximum  Permissible Exposure limits for field strength and power density for the  transmitters operating at frequencies of 300 kHz to 100 GHz and specific  absorption rate (SAR) limits for devices operating within close  proximity to the body. The Commission's requirements are detailed in  Parts 1 and 2 of the FCC's Rules and Regulations (47 CFR 1.1307(b),  1.1310, 2.1091, 2.1093).

The railroad, the supplier, or FRA may  conclude it is necessary for a third party assessment of the system. A  third party assessor should be ``independent''. An ``independent third  party'' means a technically competent entity responsible to and  compensated by the railroad (or an association on behalf of one or more  railroads) that is independent of the supplier of the product. An entity  that is owned or controlled by the supplier, that is under common  ownership or control with the supplier, or that is otherwise involved in  the development of the product would not be considered ``independent''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The reviewer should not engage in design efforts, in order to  preserve the reviewer's independence and maintain the supplier's  proprietary right to the product. The supplier should provide the  reviewer access to any, and all, documentation that the reviewer  requests and attendance at any design review or walk through that the  reviewer determines as necessary to complete and accomplish the third  party assessment. Representatives from FRA or the railroad might  accompany the reviewer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Third party reviews can occur at a preliminary level, a  functional level, or implementation level. At the preliminary level, the  reviewer should evaluate with respect to safety and comment on the  adequacy of the processes, which the supplier applies to the design, and  development of the product. At a minimum, the reviewer should compare  the supplier processes with industry best practices to determine if the  vendor methodology is acceptable and employ any other such tests or  comparisons if they have been agreed to previously with the railroad or  FRA. Based on these analyses, the reviewer shall identify and document  any significant safety vulnerabilities that are not adequately mitigated  by the supplier's (or user's) processes. At the functional level, the  reviewer evaluates the adequacy, and comprehensiveness, of the safety  analysis, and any other documents pertinent to the product being  assessed for completeness, correctness, and compliance with applicable  standards. This includes, but is not limited to the Preliminary Hazard  Analysis (PHA), the Hazard Log (HL), all Fault Tree Analyses (FTA), all  Failure Mode and Effects Criticality Analysis (FMECA), and other hazard  analyses. At the implementation level, the reviewer randomly selects  various safety-critical software modules for audit to verify whether the  system process and design requirements were followed. The number of  modules audited shall be determined as a representative number  sufficient to provide confidence that all un-audited modules were  developed in similar manner as the audited module. During this phase the  reviewer would also evaluate and comment on the adequacy of the plan for  installation and test of the product for revenue service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reviewer Report. Upon completion of an assessment, the reviewer  prepares a final report of the assessment. The report should contain the  following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The reviewer's evaluation of the adequacy of the risk analysis,  including the supplier's MTTHE and risk estimates for the product, and  the supplier's confidence interval in these estimates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Product vulnerabilities which the reviewer felt were not  adequately mitigated, including the method by which the railroad would  assure product safety in the event of a hardware or software failure  (i.e., how does the railroad or vendor assure that all potentially  hazardous failure modes are identified?) and the method by which the  railroad or vendor addresses comprehensiveness of the product design for  the requirements of the operations it will govern (i.e., how does the  railroad and/or vendor assure that all potentially hazardous operating  circumstances are identified? Who records any deficiencies identified in  the design process? Who tracks   the correction of these deficiencies and confirms that they are  corrected?);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A clear statement of position for all parties involved for each  product vulnerability cited by the reviewer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Identification of any documentation or information sought by the  reviewer that was denied, incomplete, or inadequate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A listing of each design procedure or process which was not  properly followed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Identification of the software verification and validation  procedures for the product's safety-critical applications, and the  reviewer's evaluation of the adequacy of these procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Methods employed by the product manufacturer to develop safety- critical software, such as use of structured language, code checks,  modularity, or other similar generally acceptable techniques; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Methods by which the supplier or railroad addresses  comprehensiveness of the product design which considers the safety  elements.
