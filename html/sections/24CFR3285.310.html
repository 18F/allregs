                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The location and spacing of piers depends upon the dimensions of  the home, the live and dead loads, the type of construction (single-or  multi-section), I-beam size, soil bearing capacity, footing size, and  such other factors as the location of doors or other openings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mate-line and column pier supports must be in accordance with  this subpart and consistent with Figures A through C to this section,  unless the pier support and footing configuration is designed by a  registered professional engineer or registered architect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Piers supporting the frame must be no more than 24 inches from  both ends and not more than 120 inches center to center under the main  rails.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pier support locations. Pier support locations and spacing must  be presented to be consistent with Figures A and B to Sec. 3285.312, as  applicable, unless alternative designs are provided by a professional  engineer or registered architect in accordance with acceptable  engineering practice. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC07.009</p><p class="depth2">Notes: 1. Bottom of footings must extend below frost line depth,  unless designed for placement above the frost line. (See Sec.  3285.312(b)).</p><p class="depth2">2. Piers may be offset up to 6 in. in either direction along the  supported members to allow for plumbing, electrical, mechanical,  equipment, crawlspaces, or other devices.</p><p class="depth2">3. Single-stack concrete block pier loads must not exceed 8,000 lbs.</p><p class="depth2">4. Prefabricated piers must not exceed their approved or listed  maximum vertical or horizontal design loads.</p><p class="depth2">5. When a full-height mating wall does not support the ridge beam,  this area is considered an unsupported span--Span B.</p><p class="depth2">6. Piers are not required at openings in the mating wall that are  less than 48 inches in width. Place piers on both sides of mating wall  openings that are 48 inches or greater in width. For roof loads of 40  psf or greater, a professional engineer or registered architect must  determine the maximum mating wall opening permitted without pier or  other supports.

Column piers are in addition to piers required under full-height  mating walls.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC07.011</p><p class="depth2">Notes: 1. Mate-line column support piers are installed with the long  dimension of the concrete block perpendicular to the rim joists.</p><p class="depth2">2.
