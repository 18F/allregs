It is abbreviated as Ldn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Decibel means the unit measure of sound level, abbreviated as dB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Energy Average Level means a quantity calculated by taking ten times the common logarithm of the arithmetic average of the antilogs of one-tenth of each of the levels being averaged.

The levels may be of any consistent type, e.g., day-night sound level or equivalent sound level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Equivalent Sound Level means the level, in decibels, of the mean-square A-weighted sound pressure during a stated time period, with reference to the square of the standard reference sound pressure of 20 micropascals. It is the level of the sound exposure divided by the time period and is abbreviated as Leq.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Fast Meter Response means that the ``fast'' response of the sound level meter shall be used. The fast dynamic response shall comply with the meter dynamic characteristics in paragraph 5.3 of the American National Standard Specification for Sound Level Meters. ANSI S1.4-1971. This publication is available from the American National Standards Institute, Inc., 1430 Broadway, New York, New York 10018.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Idle means that condition where all engines capable of providing motive power to the locomotive are set at the lowest operating throttle position; and where all auxiliary non-motive power engines are not operating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Interstate Commerce means the commerce between any place in a State and any place in another State, or between places in the same State through another State, whether such commerce moves wholly by rail or partly by rail and partly by motor vehicle, express, or water. This definition of ``interstate commerce'' for purposes of this regulation is similar to the definition of ``interstate commerce'' in section 203(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 303(a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Load Cell means a device external to the locomotive, of high electrical resistance, used in locomotive testing to simulate engine loading while the locomotive is stationary. (Electrical energy produced by the diesel generator is dissipated in the load cell resistors instead of the traction motors).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Locomotive means for the purpose of this regulation, a self-propelled vehicle designed for and used on railroad tracks in the transport or rail cars, including self-propelled rail passenger vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Locomotive Load Cell Test Stand means the load cell Sec. 201.1(o) and associated structure, equipment, trackage and locomotive being tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> Maximum Sound Level means the greatest A-weighted sound level in decibels measured during the designated time interval or during the event, with either fast meter response Sec. 201.1(l) or slow meter response Sec. 201.1(ii) as specified. It is abbreviated as Lmax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(s)</em> Measurement Period means a continuous period of time during which noise of railroad yard operations is assessed, the beginning and finishing times of which may be selected after completion of the measurements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(t)</em> Rail Car means a non-self-propelled vehicle designed for and used on railroad tracks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(u)</em> Railroad means all the roads in use by any common carrier operating a railroad, whether owned or operated under a contract, agreement, or lease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Receiving Property Measurement Location means a location on receiving property that is on or beyond the railroad facility boundary and that meets the receiving property measurement location criteria of subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(w)</em> Receiving Property means any residential or commercial property that receives the sound from railroad facility operations, but that is not owned or operated by a railroad; except that occupied residences located on property owned or controlled by the railroad are included in the definition of ``receiving property.'' For purposes of this definition railroad crew sleeping quarters located on property owned or controlled by the railroad are not considered as residences. If, subsequent to the publication date of these regulations, the use of any property that is currently not applicable to this regulation changes, and it is newly classified as either residential or commercial, it is not receiving property until four years have elapsed from the date of the actual change in use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Residential Property means any property that is used for any of the purposes described in the following standard land use codes (ref. Standard Land Use Coding Manual. U.S. DOT/FHWA Washington, DC, reprinted March 1977): 1, Residential: 651, Medical and other Health Services; 68, Educational Services; 691, Religious Activities; and 711, Cultural Activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(y)</em> Retarder (Active) means a device or system for decelerating rolling rail cars and controlling the degree of deceleration on a car by car basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(z)</em> Retarder Sound means a sound which is heard and identified by the observer as that of a retarder, and that causes a sound level meter indicator at fast meter response Sec. 201.1(l) to register an increase of at least ten decibels above the level observed immediately before hearing the sound.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(aa)</em> Sound Level means the level, in decibels, measured by instrumentation which satisfies the requirements of American National Standard Specification for Sound Level Meters S1.4-1971 Type 1 (or S1A) or Type 2 if adjusted as shown in Table 1. This publication is available from the American National Standards Institute, Inc., 1430 Broadway, New York, New York 10018. For the purpose of these procedures the sound level is to be measured using the Aweighting of spectrum and either the FAST or SLOW dynamic averaging characteristics, as designated. It is abbreviated as LA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(bb)</em> Sound Exposure Level means the level in decibels calculated as ten times the common logarithm of time integral of squared A-weighted sound pressure over a given time period or event divided by the square of the standard reference sound pressure of 20 micropascals and a reference duration of one second.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(cc)</em> Sound Pressure Level (in stated frequency band) means the level, in decibels, calculated as 20 times the common logarithm of the ratio of a sound pressure to the reference sound pressure of 20 micropascals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(dd)</em> Special Purpose Equipment means maintenance-of-way equipment which may be located on or operated from rail cars including: Ballast cribbing machines, ballast regulators, conditioners and scarifiers, bolt machines, brush cutters, compactors, concrete mixers, cranes and derricks, earth boring machines, electric welding machines, grinders, grouters, pile drivers, rail heaters, rail layers, sandblasters, snow plows, spike drivers, sprayers and other types of such maintenance-of-way equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ee)</em> Special Track Work means track other than normal tie and ballast bolted or welded rail or containing devices such as retarders or switching mechanisms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ff)</em> Statistical Sound Level means the level in decibels that is exceeded in a stated percentage (x) of the duration of the measurement period. It is abbreviated as Lx.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(gg)</em> Switcher Locomotive means any locomotive designated as a switcher by the builder or reported to the ICC as a switcher by the operator-owning-railroad and including, but not limited to, all locomotives of the builder/model designations listed in Appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(hh)</em> Warning Device means a sound emitting device used to alert and warn people of the presence of railroad equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Slow Meter Response means that the slow response of the sound level meter shall be used. The slow dynamic response shall comply with the meter dynamic characteristics in paragraph 5.4 of the American National Standard Specification for Sound Level Meters. ANSI S1.4-1971.
