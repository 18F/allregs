                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Since the clause at 52.232-32, Performance-Based Payments, gives the Government title to the property described in paragraph (f) of the clause, the contracting officer shall ensure that the Government title is not compromised by other encumbrances. Ordinarily, the contracting officer, in the absence of reason to believe otherwise, may rely upon the contractor's certification contained in the payment request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the contracting officer becomes aware of any arrangement or condition that would impair the Government's title to the property affected by the Performance-Based Payments clause, the contracting officer shall require additional protective provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The existence of any such encumbrance is a violation of the contractor's obligations under the contract, and the contracting officer may, if necessary, suspend or reduce payments under the terms of the Performance-Based Payments clause covering failure to comply with a material requirement of the contract. In addition, if the contractor fails to disclose an existing encumbrance in the certification, the contracting officer should consult with legal counsel concerning possible violation of 31 U.S.C. 3729, the False Claims Act.
