                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Discretionary withdrawals of specific duration, whether made prior to or after October 21, 1976, shall be reviewed by the Secretary commencing at least 2 years before the expiration date of the withdrawal. When requested, the department, agency or office benefitting from the withdrawal shall promptly provide the Secretary with the information required by Sec. 2310.1-2(c) of this title, and the information required by Sec. 2310.3-2(b) of this title, in the form of a withdrawal extension application with supplemental information. If the concerned department, agency or office is delinquent in responding to such request, the deliquency shall constitute a ground for not extending the withdrawal. Such withdrawals may be extended or further extended only upon compliance with these regulations, and only if the Secretary determines that the purpose for which the withdrawal was first made requires the extension, and then only for a period that shall not exceed the duration of the original withdrawal period. In allowing an extension, the Secretary shall comply with the provisions of section 204(c) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1714(c)), or section 204(d) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1714(d)), whichever is applicable; and, whether or not an extension is allowed, the Secretary shall report promptly on the decision for each pending extension to the Congressional Committees that are specified in section 204(f) of the Act (43 U.S.C. 1714(f)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if the Secretary determines that a National Wildlife Refuge System withdrawal of specific duration shall not be extended, the Secretary shall nevertheless extend or reextend the withdrawal until such time as the withdrawal is terminated by an Act of Congress.</p>
