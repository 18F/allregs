Such application shall be accompanied by a written explanation and shall state the last known address of the missing owner. Notice of the filing of the application shall be forwarded by the Office to the missing owner at the last known address. If such notice is returned to the Office undelivered, or if

the address of the missing owner is unknown, notice of the filing of the application shall be published once in the Official Journal.
