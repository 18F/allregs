                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Military Police Investigators (MPI) and Department of the Army  Civilian (DAC) detectives/investigators fulfill a special need for an  investigative element within the military police to investigate many  incidents, complaints, and matters not within U.S. Army Criminal  Investigation Command (USACIDC) jurisdiction, but which cannot be  resolved immediately   through routine military police operations. Investigative personnel are  assets of the installation or activity commander, under the supervision  of the local provost marshal. USACIDC elements will provide  investigative assistance in the form of professional expertise,  laboratory examinations, polygraph examinations, or any other assistance  requested which does not distract from the USACIDC mission of  investigating serious crimes. A spirit of cooperation and close working  relationship is essential between USACIDC and the provost marshal office  in order to accomplish the mission and project a professional police  image.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Creation of a formalized investigation program does not  constitute the establishment of a dual ``detective'' force. The  separation of investigative responsibilities is very distinct. The MPI  Program is neither a career program nor a separate Military Occupational  Specialty (MOS). Individuals in the MPI Program are specially selected,  trained, and experienced military or civilian men and women performing  traditional military police functions. Military personnel are identified  by their additional skill identifiers (ASI V5) and may be employed in  any assignment appropriate to their grade and MOS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The provost marshal may authorize wearing of civilian clothing  for the MPI investigative mission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> MPI and DAC detective/investigator personnel must be familiar  with and meet the requirements of Army Regulation (AR) 190-14 (Carrying  of Firearms and Use of Force for Law Enforcement and Security Duties).</p>
