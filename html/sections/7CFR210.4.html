                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. To the extent funds are available, FNS will make cash assistance available in accordance with the provisions of this section to each State agency for lunches and meal supplements served to children under the National School Lunch and Commodity School Programs. To the extent donated foods are available, FNS will provide donated food assistance to distributing agencies for each lunch served in accordance with the provisions of this part and part 250 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assistance for the National School Lunch Program. The Secretary will make cash and/or donated food assistance available to each State agency and distributing agency, as appropriate, administering the National School Lunch Program, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cash assistance will be made available to each State agency administering the National School Lunch Program as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General: Cash assistance payments are composed of a general cash assistance payment and a performance-based cash assistance payment, authorized under section 4 of the Act, and a special cash assistance payment, authorized under section 11 of the Act. General cash assistance is provided to each State agency for all lunches served to children in accordance with the provisions of the National School Lunch Program. Performance-based cash assistance is provided to each State agency for lunches served in accordance with Sec. 210.7(d). Special cash assistance is provided to each State agency for lunches served under the National School Lunch Program to children determined eligible for free or reduced price lunches in accordance with part 245 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cash assistance for lunches. The total general cash assistance paid to each State for any fiscal year shall not exceed the lesser of amounts reported to FNS as reimbursed to school food authorities in accordance with Sec. 210.5(d)(3) or the total calculated by multiplying the number of lunches reported in accordance with Sec. 210.5(d)(1) for each month of service during the fiscal year, by the applicable national average payment rate prescribed by FNS. The total performance-based cash assistance paid to each State for any fiscal year shall not exceed the lesser of amounts reported to FNS as reimbursed to school food authorities in accordance with Sec. 210.5(d)(3) or the total calculated by multiplying the number of lunches reported in accordance with Sec. 210.5(d)(1) for each month of service during the fiscal year, by 6 cents for school year 2012-2013, adjusted annually thereafter as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. The total special assistance paid to each State for any fiscal year shall not exceed the lesser of amounts reported to FNS as reimbursed to school food authorities in accordance with Sec. 210.5(d)(3) or the total calculated by multiplying the number of free and reduced price lunches reported in accordance with Sec. 210.5(d)(1) for each month of service during the fiscal year by the applicable national average payment rate prescribed by FNS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Annual adjustments. In accordance with section 11 of the Act, FNS will prescribe annual adjustments to the per meal national average payment rate (general cash assistance), the performance-based cash assistance rate (performance-based cash assistance), and the special assistance national average payment rates (special cash assistance) which are effective on July 1 of each year. These adjustments, which reflect changes in the food away from home series of the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, are annually announced by Notice in July of each year in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Maximum per meal rates. FNS will also establish maximum per meal rates of reimbursement within which a State may vary reimbursement rates to school food authorities. These maximum rates of reimbursement are established at the same time and announced in the same Notice as the national average payment rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Donated food assistance. For each school year, FNS will provide distributing agencies with donated foods for lunches served under the National School Lunch Program as provided under part 250 of this chapter. The per lunch value of donated food assistance is adjusted by the Secretary annually to reflect changes as required under section 6 of the Act. These adjustments, which reflect changes in the Price Index for Foods Used in Schools and Institutions, are effective on July 1 of each year and are announced by Notice in the Federal Register in July of each year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cash assistance for meal supplements. For those eligible schools (as defined in Sec. 210.10(n)(1)) operating afterschool care programs and electing to serve meal supplements to enrolled children, funds shall be made available to each State agency, each school year in an amount no less than the sum of the products obtained by multiplying:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The number of meal supplements served in the afterschool care program within the State to children from families that do not satisfy the income standards for free and reduced price school meals by 2.75 cents;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The number of meal supplements served in the afterschool care program within the State to children from families that satisfy the income standard for free school meals by 30 cents;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The number of meal supplements served in the afterschool care program within the State to children from families that satisfy the income standard for reduced price school meals by 15 cents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The rates in paragraph (b)(3) are the base rates established in August 1981 for the CACFP. FNS shall prescribe annual adjustments to these rates in the same Notice as the National Average Payment Rates for lunches. These adjustments shall ensure that the reimbursement rates for meal supplements served under this part are the same as those implemented for meal supplements in the CACFP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assistance for the Commodity School Program. FNS will make special cash

assistance available to each State agency for lunches served in commodity schools in the same manner as special cash assistance is provided in the National School Lunch Program. Payment of such amounts to State agencies is subject to the reporting requirements contained in Sec. 210.5(d). FNS will provide donated food assistance in accordance with part 250 of this chapter. Of the total value of donated food assistance to which it is entitled, the school food authority may elect to receive cash payments of up to 5 cents per lunch served in its commodity school(s) for donated foods processing and handling expenses. Such expenses include any expenses incurred by or on behalf of a commodity school for processing or other aspects of the preparation, delivery, and storage of donated foods. The school food authority may have all or part of these cash payments retained by the State agency for use on its behalf for processing and handling expenses by the State agency or it may authorize the State agency to transfer to the distributing agency all or any part of these payments for use on its behalf for these expenses. Payment of such amounts to State agencies is subject to the reporting requirements contained in Sec. 210.5(d). The total value of donated food assistance is calculated on a school year basis by adding:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicable national average payment rate (general cash assistance) prescribed by the Secretary for the period of July 1 through June 30 multiplied by the total number of lunches served during the school year under the Commodity School Program; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The national per lunch average value of donated foods prescribed by the Secretary for the period of July 1 through June 30 multiplied by the total number of lunches served during the school year under the Commodity School Program.
