                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons to mitigate losses or expenses incurred because of the Karnal bunt regulations and emergency actions, as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Growers, handlers, and seed companies in areas under first regulated crop season. Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section if: The wheat was grown in a State where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency; and the wheat was grown in an area of that State that became regulated for Karnal bunt after the crop was planted, or for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) was issued after the crop was planted; and the wheat was grown in an area that remained regulated or under Emergency Action Notification at the time the wheat was sold. Growers and handlers of wheat grown in Oklahoma during the 2000-2001 growing season are eligible to receive compensation if the wheat was commingled in storage with wheat that meets the above requirements of this paragraph. Growers, handlers, and seed companies in areas under the first regulated crop season are eligible for compensation for 1999-2000 or subsequent crop season wheat and for wheat inventories in their possession that were unsold at the time the area became regulated. The compensation provided in this paragraph is for wheat grain, certified wheat seed, wheat held back from harvest by a grower in the 2000-2001 growing season for use as seed in the next growing season, and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Growers. Growers of wheat in an area under the first regulated crop season, who sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after sale and the price received by the grower is contingent on the test results, are eligible to receive compensation as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section. However, compensation for positive-testing wheat will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the wheat was grown under contract and a price was determined in the contract before the area where the wheat was grown became regulated, compensation will equal the contract price minus the actual price received by the grower.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the wheat was not grown under contract or a price was determined in the contract after the area where the wheat was grown became regulated, compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) minus the actual price received by the grower. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the harvest months for the area, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. Separate estimated market prices will be calculated for certified wheat seed and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed, and wheat grain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Handlers and seed companies. Handlers and seed companies who sell wheat grown in an area under the first regulated crop season are eligible to receive compensation only if the wheat was not tested by APHIS prior to purchase by the handler or seed company, but was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after purchase by the handler or seed company, as long as the price to be paid is not contingent on the test results. Compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) minus the actual price received by the handler or seed company. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the harvest months for the

area, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. Separate estimated market prices will be calculated for certified wheat seed and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed, and wheat grain. However, compensation will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Growers, handlers, and seed companies in previously regulated areas. For the 1999-2000 crop season and the 2000-2001 crop season only, growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section if: The wheat was grown in a State where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency; and the wheat was grown in an area of that State that became regulated for Karnal bunt before the crop was planted, or for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) was issued before the crop was planted; and the wheat was grown in an area that remained regulated or under Emergency Action Notification at the time the wheat was sold. Growers, handlers, and seed companies in previously regulated areas will not be eligible for compensation for wheat from the 2001-2002 and subsequent crop seasons; except that, for growers or handlers of wheat harvested in any field in the Texas counties of Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young during the 2000-2001 crop season that has not been found to contain a bunted wheat kernel, this requirement applies to compensation for wheat from the 2002-2003 and subsequent crop seasons. The compensation provided in this paragraph is for wheat grain, certified wheat seed, and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Growers. Growers of wheat in a previously regulated area who sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after sale and the price received by the grower is contingent on the test results, are eligible to receive compensation at the rate of $.60 per bushel of positive testing wheat.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Handlers and seed companies. Handlers and seed companies who sell wheat grown in a previously regulated area are eligible to receive compensation only if the wheat was not tested by APHIS prior to purchase by the handler, but was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after purchase by the handler or seed company, as long as the price to be paid by the handler or seed company is not contingent on the test results. Compensation will be at the rate of $.60 per bushel of positive testing wheat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To claim compensation. Compensation payments to growers, handlers, and seed companies under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by FSA on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for subsequent crop seasons must be received by FSA on or before March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend the deadline, upon request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates. To claim compensation, a grower, handler, or seed company must complete and submit to the local FSA county office the following documents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Growers, handlers, and seed companies. A grower, handler, or seed company must submit a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA. If the wheat was grown in an area that is not a regulated area, but for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) (EAN) has been issued, the grower, handler, or seed company must submit a copy of the EAN. Growers, handlers, and seed companies must also submit a copy of the Karnal bunt certificate issued by APHIS that shows the Karnal bunt test results, and verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat that tested positive (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket, or other verification). For compensation claims for wheat seed, a grower or seed company must submit documentation showing that the wheat is either certified seed or was grown with the intention of producing certified seed

(this documentation may include one or more of the following types of documents: an application to the State seed certification agency for field inspection; a bulk sale certificate; certification tags or labels issued by the State seed certification agency; or a document issued by the State seed certification agency verifying that the wheat is certified seed);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Growers. In addition to the documents required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, growers must submit a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total price received by the grower. Growers compensated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section (previously regulated areas) whose wheat was not tested prior to sale must submit documentation showing that the price paid to the grower was contingent on test results (such as a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat or a copy of the contract the grower has for the wheat, if this information appears on those documents).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Handlers and seed companies. In addition to the documents required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, handlers and seed companies must submit a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total price received by the handler or seed company. The handler or seed company must also submit documentation showing that the price paid or to be paid to the grower is not contingent on the test results (such as a copy of the receipt for the purchase of the wheat or a copy of the contract the handler or seed company has with the grower, if this information appears on those documents).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special allowance for negative wheat grown in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young Counties, TX, in the 2000-2001 growing season. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, wheat that was harvested from fields in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, in the 2000-2001 growing season, and that tested negative for Karnal bunt after harvest, is eligible for compensation in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special allowance for disposal costs for treated uncertified wheat seed in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young Counties, TX, in the 2000-2001 growing season. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, growers in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, who own treated uncertified wheat seed that tested positive for Karnal bunt spores during the 2000-2001 growing season are eligible for compensation in accordance with this paragraph. The grower is eligible for compensation for the costs of disposing of such wheat seed, by burial on the grower's premises, by burial at a landfill, or through another means approved by APHIS. The compensation for disposing of wheat seed by burial on the grower's premises is $1.00 per bushel. The compensation for disposing of wheat seed by burial at a landfill, or through another means approved by APHIS, is the actual cost of disposal, up to $1.20 per bushel, as verified by receipts for disposal costs. To apply for this compensation, the grower must submit a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA, and must also submit a copy of the Karnal bunt certificate issued by APHIS that shows the Karnal bunt test results, and verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the uncertified wheat seed that tested positive for spores (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket, or other verification). For seed disposed of by burial at a landfill the grower must also submit one or more receipts for the disposal costs of the uncertified wheat seed, showing the total bushels destroyed and the total disposal costs (landfill fees, transportation costs, etc.).
