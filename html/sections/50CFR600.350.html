                                Sec. 600.350  National Standard 9--Bycatch.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standard 9. Conservation and management measures shall, to the  extent practicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Minimize bycatch; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the extent bycatch cannot be avoided, minimize the mortality  of such bycatch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General. This national standard requires Councils to consider  the bycatch effects of existing and planned conservation and management  measures. Bycatch can, in two ways, impede efforts to protect marine  ecosystems and achieve sustainable fisheries and the full benefits they  can provide to the Nation. First, bycatch can increase substantially the  uncertainty concerning total fishing-related mortality, which makes it  more difficult to assess the status of stocks, to set the appropriate OY  and define overfishing levels, and to ensure that OYs are attained and  overfishing levels are not exceeded. Second, bycatch may also preclude  other more productive uses of fishery resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definition--Bycatch. The term ``bycatch'' means fish that are  harvested in a fishery, but that are not sold or kept for personal use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inclusions. Bycatch includes the discard of whole fish at sea or  elsewhere, including economic discards and regulatory discards, and  fishing mortality due to an encounter with fishing gear that does not  result in capture of fish (i.e., unobserved fishing mortality).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exclusions. Bycatch excludes the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fish that legally are retained in a fishery and kept for  personal, tribal, or cultural use, or that enter commerce through sale,  barter, or trade.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fish released alive under a recreational catch-and-release  fishery management program. A catch-and-release fishery management  program is one in which the retention of a particular species is  prohibited. In such a program, those fish released alive would not be  considered bycatch.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fish harvested in a commercial fishery managed by the  Secretary under Magnuson-Stevens Act sec. 304(g) or the Atlantic Tunas  Convention Act of 1975 (16 U.S.C. 971d) or highly migratory species  harvested in a commercial fishery managed by a Council under the  Magnuson-Stevens Act or the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries  Convention Implementation Act, that are not regulatory discards and that  are   tagged and released alive under a scientific tagging and release program  established by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Minimizing bycatch and bycatch mortality. The priority under  this standard is first to avoid catching bycatch species where  practicable. Fish that are bycatch and cannot be avoided must, to the  extent practicable, be returned to the sea alive. Any proposed  conservation and management measure that does not give priority to  avoiding the capture of bycatch species must be supported by appropriate  analyses. In their evaluation, the Councils must consider the net  benefits to the Nation, which include, but are not limited to: Negative  impacts on affected stocks; incomes accruing to participants in directed  fisheries in both the short and long term; incomes accruing to  participants in fisheries that target the bycatch species; environmental  consequences; non-market values of bycatch species, which include non- consumptive uses of bycatch species and existence values, as well as  recreational values; and impacts on other marine organisms. To evaluate  conservation and management measures relative to this and other national  standards, as well as to evaluate total fishing mortality, Councils  must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Promote development of a database on bycatch and bycatch  mortality in the fishery to the extent practicable. A review and, where  necessary, improvement of data collection methods, data sources, and  applications of data must be initiated for each fishery to determine the  amount, type, disposition, and other characteristics of bycatch and  bycatch mortality in each fishery for purposes of this standard and of  section 303(a)(11) and (12) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Bycatch should  be categorized to focus on management responses necessary to minimize  bycatch and bycatch mortality to the extent practicable. When  appropriate, management measures, such as at-sea monitoring programs,  should be developed to meet these information needs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each management measure, assess the effects on the amount  and type of bycatch and bycatch mortality in the fishery. Most  conservation and management measures can affect the amounts of bycatch  or bycatch mortality in a fishery, as well as the extent to which  further reductions in bycatch are practicable. In analyzing measures,  including the status quo, Councils should assess the impacts of  minimizing bycatch and bycatch mortality, as well as consistency of the  selected measure with other national standards and applicable laws. The  benefits of minimizing bycatch to the extent practicable should be  identified and an assessment of the impact of the selected measure on  bycatch and bycatch mortality provided. Due to limitations on the  information available, fishery managers may not be able to generate  precise estimates of bycatch and bycatch mortality or other effects for  each alternative. In the absence of quantitative estimates of the  impacts of each alternative, Councils may use qualitative measures.  Information on the amount and type of bycatch should be summarized in  the SAFE reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Select measures that, to the extent practicable, will minimize  bycatch and bycatch mortality. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A determination of whether a  conservation and management measure minimizes bycatch or bycatch  mortality to the extent practicable, consistent with other national  standards and maximization of net benefits to the Nation, should  consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Population effects for the bycatch species.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Ecological effects due to changes in the bycatch of that species  (effects on other species in the ecosystem).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Changes in the bycatch of- other species of fish and the  resulting population and ecosystem effects.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Effects on marine mammals and birds.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Changes in fishing, processing, disposal, and marketing costs.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Changes in fishing practices and behavior of fishermen.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Changes in research, administration, and enforcement costs and  management effectiveness.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Changes in the economic, social, or cultural value of fishing  activities and nonconsumptive uses of fishery resources.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> Changes in the distribution of benefits and costs.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(J)</em> Social effects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Councils should adhere to the precautionary approach found  in the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Article 6.5), which is  available from the Director, Publications Division, FAO, Viale delle  Terme di Caracalla, 00100 Rome, Italy, when faced with uncertainty  concerning any of the factors listed in this paragraph (d)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Monitor selected management measures. Effects of implemented  measures should be evaluated routinely. Monitoring systems should be  established prior to fishing under the selected management measures.  Where applicable, plans should be developed and coordinated with  industry and other concerned organizations to identify opportunities for  cooperative data collection, coordination of data management for cost  efficiency, and avoidance of duplicative effort.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other considerations. Other applicable laws, such as the MMPA,  the ESA, and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, require that Councils  consider the impact of conservation and management measures on living  marine resources other than fish; i.e., marine mammals and birds.
