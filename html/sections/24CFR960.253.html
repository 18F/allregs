                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Rent options--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual choice by family. Once a year, the PHA  must give each family the opportunity to choose between the two methods  for determining the amount of tenant rent payable monthly by the family.  The family may choose to pay as tenant rent either a flat rent as  determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, or an  income-based rent as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this  section. Except for financial hardship cases as provided in paragraph  (d) of this section, the family may not be offered this choice more than  once a year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Relation to minimum rent. Regardless of whether the family  chooses to pay a flat rent or income-based rent, the family must pay at  least the minimum rent as determined in accordance with Sec. 5.630 of  this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Flat rent. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The flat rent is based on the market rent charged  for comparable units in the private unassisted rental market. It is  equal to the estimated rent for which the PHA could promptly lease the  public housing unit after preparation for occupancy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The PHA must use a reasonable method to determine the flat rent  for a unit. To determine the flat rent, the PHA must consider:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The location, quality, size, unit type and age of the unit; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any amenities, housing services, maintenance and utilities  provided by the PHA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The flat rent is designed to encourage self-sufficiency and to  avoid creating disincentives for continued residency by families who are  attempting to become economically self-sufficient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the family chooses to pay a flat rent, the PHA does not pay  any utility reimbursement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The PHA must maintain records that document the method used to  determine flat rents, and also show how flat rents are determined by the  PHA in accordance with this method, and document flat rents offered to  families under this method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Income-based rent. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An income-based rent is a tenant rent  that is based on the family's income and the PHA's rent policies for  determination of such rents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The PHA rent policies may specify that the PHA will use  percentage of family income or some other reasonable system to determine  income-based rents. The PHA rent policies may provide for depositing a  portion of tenant rent in an escrow or savings account, for imposing a  ceiling on tenant rents, for adoption of permissive income deductions  (see Sec. 5.611(b) of this title), or for another reasonable system to  determining the amount of income-based tenant rent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The income-based tenant rent must not exceed the total tenant  payment (Sec. 5.628 of this title) for the family minus any applicable  utility allowance for tenant-paid utilities. If the utility allowance  exceeds the total tenant   payment, the PHA shall pay such excess amount (the utility  reimbursement) either to the family or directly to the utility supplier  to pay the utility bill on behalf of the family. If the PHA elects to  pay the utility supplier, the PHA must notify the family of the amount  of utility reimbursement paid to the utility supplier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ceiling rent. Instead of using flat rents, a PHA may retain  ceiling rents that were authorized and established before October 1,  1999, for a period of three years from October 1, 1999. After this three  year period, the PHA must adjust such ceiling rents to the level  required for flat rents under this section; however, ceiling rents are  subject to paragraph (a) of this section, the annual reexamination  requirements, and the limitation that the tenant rent plus any utility  allowance may not exceed the total tenant payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Information for families. For the family to make an informed  choice about its rent options, the PHA must provide sufficient  information for an informed choice. Such information must include at  least the following written information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The PHA's policies on switching type of rent in circumstances of  financial hardship, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The dollar amounts of tenant rent for the family under each  option. If the family chose a flat rent for the previous year, the PHA  is required to provide the amount of income-based rent for the  subsequent year only the year the PHA conducts an income reexamination  or if the family specifically requests it and submits updated income  information. For a family that chooses the flat rent option, the PHA  must conduct a reexamination of family income at least once every three  years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Switch from flat rent to income-based rent because of hardship.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A family that is paying a flat rent may at any time request a switch  to payment of income-based rent (before the next annual option to select  the type of rent) if the family is unable to pay flat rent because of  financial hardship. The PHA must adopt written policies for determining  when payment of flat rent is a financial hardship for the family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the PHA determines that the family is unable to pay the flat  rent because of financial hardship, the PHA must immediately allow the  requested switch to income-based rent. The PHA shall make the  determination within a reasonable time after the family request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The PHA policies for determining when payment of flat rent is a  financial hardship must provide that financial hardship include the  following situations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The family has experienced a decrease in income because of  changed circumstances, including loss or reduction of employment, death  in the family, or reduction in or loss of earnings or other assistance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The family has experienced an increase in expenses, because of  changed circumstances, for medical costs, child care, transportation,  education, or similar items; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Such other situations determined by the PHA to be appropriate.</p>
