                            <p class="depth0">Statements of identity, indications, warnings, and directions for use, respectively, applicable to each ingredient in the product may be combined to eliminate duplicative words or phrases so that the resulting information is clear and understandable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Statement of identity. For a combination drug product that has an established name, the labeling of the product states the established name of the combination drug product, followed by the statement of identity for each ingredient in the combination, as established in the statement of identity sections of the applicable OTC drug monographs. For a combination drug product that does not have an established name, the labeling of the product states the statement of identity for each ingredient in the combination, as established in the statement of identity sections of the applicable OTC drug monographs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Indications. The labeling of the product states, under the heading ``Uses,'' the indication(s) for each ingredient in the combination as established in the indications sections of the applicable OTC drug monographs, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph. Other truthful and nonmisleading statements, describing only the indications for use that have been established in the applicable OTC drug monographs or listed in this paragraph (b), may also be used, as provided by Sec.  330.1(c)(2) of this chapter, subject to the provisions of section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) relating to misbranding and the prohibition in section 301(d) of the act against the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of unapproved new drugs in violation of section 505(a) of the act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition, the labeling of the product may contain any of the ``other allowable statements'' that are identified in the applicable monographs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For permitted combinations containing a sunscreen and a skin protectant identified in Sec.  352.20(b), any or all of the applicable indications for sunscreens in Sec.  352.52(b) and the indication for skin protectants in Sec.  347.50(b)(2)(i) of this chapter should be used. For products marketed as a lip protectant, the indication in Sec.  352.52(f)(1)(ii) should be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Warnings.

When the time intervals or age limitations for administration of the individual ingredients differ, the directions for the combination product may not contain any dosage that exceeds those established for any individual ingredient in the applicable OTC drug monograph(s), and may not provide for use by any age group lower than the highest minimum age limit established for any individual ingredient. For permitted combinations containing a sunscreen and a skin protectant identified in Sec.  352.20(b), the directions for sunscreens in Sec.  352.52(d) should be used. For products marketed as a lip protectant or lipstick, Sec.  352.52(d)(4) applies.
