In addition, the EPA enters other information describing the nature of your disqualification. Federal award officials and others who administer Federal programs consult the EPLS before entering into or approving procurement and nonprocurement transactions. Anyone may access the EPLS through the internet, currently at http://www.epls.gov.</p>
