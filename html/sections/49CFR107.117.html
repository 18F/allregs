The Associate  Administrator will review an application for emergency processing of a  special permit in conformance with the standard operating procedures  specified in appendix A of this part (``Standard Operating Procedures  for Special Permits and Approvals'') to determine if it is complete and  conforms with the requirements of this subpart. If the Associate  Administrator determines that an emergency exists under Sec. 107.117(a)  and that, with reference to the criteria of Sec. 107.113(f), granting of  the application is in the public interest, the Associate Administrator  will grant the application subject to such terms as necessary and  immediately notify the applicant. If the Associate Administrator  determines that an emergency does not exist or that granting of the  application is not in the public interest, the applicant will be  notified immediately.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p>
