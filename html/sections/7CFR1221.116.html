The Secretary shall have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations concerning assessments and the collection of assessments, if the Board is not in place or is otherwise unable to develop such rules and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Payment remitted pursuant to this subpart shall be in the form of a negotiable instrument made payable to the Board.
