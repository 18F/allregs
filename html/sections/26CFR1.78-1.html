Any reduction under section 907(a) of the foreign income taxes deemed to be paid with respect to foreign oil and gas extraction income does not affect the amount treated as a section 78 dividend. If a domestic corporation chooses to have the benefits of the foreign tax credit under section 901 for any taxable year, an amount which is equal to the foreign income taxes deemed to be paid by such corporation for such year under section 902(a) in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.902-1 and 1.902-2 and Sec. 1.902(b)(2), or under section 960(a)(1) in accordance with Sec. 1.960-7, shall, to the extent provided by this section, be treated as a dividend (hereinafter referred to as a section 78 dividend) received by such domestic corporation from the foreign corporation described in section 902(a) in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.902-1 and 1.902-2 or section 960(c)(1) in accordance with Sec. 1.960-7, as the case may be. A section 78 dividend shall be treated as a dividend for all purposes of the Code, except that it shall not be treated as a dividend under section 245, relating to dividends received from certain foreign corporations, or increase the earnings and profits of the domestic corporation. For purposes of determining the source of a section 78 dividend in computing the limitation on

For rules respecting the reduction of foreign income taxes under section 6038(b) in applying section 902(a) in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.902-1 and 1.902-2 or section 960(c)(1) in accordance with Sec. 1.960-7, where there has been a failure to furnish certain information and for an illustration of the effect of such reduction upon the amount of a section 78 dividend, see paragraph (l) of Sec. 1.6038-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certain taxes not treated as a section 78 dividend.
