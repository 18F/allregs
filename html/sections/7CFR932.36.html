                            <p class="depth0">Decisions of the committee shall be by majority vote of the members  present and voting, and a quorum must be present: Provided, That  decisions requiring a recommendation to the Secretary on matters  pertaining to grade and size regulations shall require at least 10  affirmative votes, at least 5 of which must be from producer members and  at least 5 of which must be from handler members and, if the committee   is increased by the addition of a public member, at least 11 affirmative  votes shall be required, at least 5 of which must be from producer  members and at least 5 of which must be from handler members. A quorum  shall consist of at least 10 members of whom at least 5 shall be  producer members and at least 5 shall be handler members and, if the  committee is increased by the addition of a public member, a quorum  shall consist of at least 11 members of which at least 5 shall be  producer members and at least 5 shall be handler members. Except in case  of an emergency, a minimum of 5 days advance notice shall be given with  respect to any meeting of the committee. In case of an emergency, to be  determined within the discretion of the chairman of the committee, as  much advance notice of a meeting as is practicable in the circumstances  shall be given. The committee may vote by mail or telegram upon due  notice to all members, but any proposition to be so voted upon first  shall be explained accurately, fully, and identically by mail or  telegram to all members. When voted on by such method, at least 14  affirmative votes, of which seven shall be producer member votes and  seven shall be handler member votes, shall be required for adoption and,  if the committee is increased by the addition of a public member, votes  by mail or telegram shall require at least 15 affirmative votes, of  which at least 7 shall be producer member votes and at least 7 shall be  handler member votes. The committee may recommend for the Secretary's  approval changes in the number of affirmative votes required for  adoption of any proposition voted upon by means of a mail or telegram  ballot: Provided, That the number of affirmative votes required for  adoption shall not be less than ten, and in any case an equal number of  producer member and handler member votes shall be required for adoption  and, if the committee is increased by the addition of a public member,  the number of affirmative votes required for adoption shall be increased  by one.
