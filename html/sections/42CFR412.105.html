                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">CMS makes an additional payment to hospitals for indirect medical education costs using the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Basic data.

with or follows the start of the sixth program year of the first new program started, for hospitals for which the full-time equivalent cap may be adjusted in accordance with Sec. 413.79(e)(1) of this chapter, and prior to the beginning of the applicable hospital's cost reporting period that coincides with or follows the start of the sixth program year of the each individual new program started, for hospitals for which the full-time equivalent cap may be adjusted in accordance with Sec. 413.79(e)(3) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The exception for closed hospitals and closed programs described in paragraph (f)(1)(ix) of this section applies only through the end of the first 12-month cost reporting period in which the receiving hospital trains the displaced full-time equivalent residents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the cost reporting period following the last year the receiving hospital's full-time equivalent cap is adjusted for the displaced resident(s), the resident-to-bed ratio cap in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is calculated as if the displaced full-time equivalent residents had not trained at the receiving hospital in the prior year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The hospital's DRG revenue for inpatient operating costs based on DRG-adjusted prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs, excluding outlier payments for inpatient operating costs determined under subpart F of this part and additional payments made under the provisions of Sec. 412.106.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of the number of beds. For purposes of this section, the number of beds in a hospital is determined by counting the number of available bed days during the cost reporting period and dividing that number by the number of days in the cost reporting period. This count of available bed days excludes bed days associated with--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Beds in a unit or ward that is not occupied to provide a level of care that would be payable under the acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system at any time during the 3 preceding months (the beds in the unit or ward are to be excluded from the determination of available bed days during the current month);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Beds in a unit or ward that is otherwise occupied (to provide a level of care that would be payable under the acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system) that could not be made available for inpatient occupancy within 24 hours for 30 consecutive days;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Beds in excluded distinct part hospital units;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Beds otherwise countable under this section used for outpatient observation services, skilled nursing swing-bed services, or inpatient hospice services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Beds or bassinets in the healthy newborn nursery; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Custodial care beds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Measurement for teaching activity. The factor representing the effect of teaching activity on inpatient operating costs equals .405 for discharges occurring on or after May 1, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determination of education adjustment factor. Each hospital's education adjustment factor is calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Step one. A factor representing the sum of 1.00 plus the hospital's ratio of full-time equivalent residents to beds, as determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is raised to an exponential power equal to the factor set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step two. The factor derived from step one is reduced by 1.00.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Step three.

Each hospital's indirect medical education payment under the prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs is determined by multiplying the total DRG revenue for inpatient operating costs, as determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, by the applicable education adjustment factor derived in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determination of payment amount. Each hospital's indirect medical education payment under the prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs is determined by multiplying the total DRG revenue for inpatient operating costs, as determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, by the applicable education adjustment factor derived in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For discharges occurring on or after July 1, 2005, a hospital that counts additional residents as a result of an increase in its FTE resident cap under paragraph (f)(1)(iv)(C) of this section will receive indirect medical education payments based on the sum of the following two indirect medical education adjustment factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An adjustment factor that is calculated using the schedule of formula multipliers in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and the hospital's FTE resident count, not including residents attributable to an increase in its FTE cap under paragraph (f)(1)(iv)(C) under this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An adjustment factor that is calculated using the applicable formula multiplier under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, and the additional number of FTE residents that are attributable to the increase in the hospital's FTE resident cap under paragraph (f)(1)(iv)(C) in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Determining the total number of full-time equivalent residents for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1991. (1) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1991, the count of full-time equivalent residents for the purpose of determining the indirect medical education adjustment is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1991, the count of full-time equivalent residents for the purpose of determining the indirect medical education adjustment is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The resident must be enrolled in an approved teaching program.
