                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. In addition to the methods specified in Secs. 416.560, 416.570, 416.572 and 416.580, we may recover an overpayment under title XVI of the Act from you under the rules in subparts D and E of part 422 of this chapter. Subpart D of part 422 of this chapter applies only under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The overpayment occurred after you attained age 18;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You are no longer entitled to benefits under title XVI of the Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, we have determined that the overpayment is otherwise unrecoverable under section 1631(b) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When we consider an overpayment to be otherwise unrecoverable. We consider an overpayment under title XVI of the Act to be otherwise unrecoverable under section 1631(b) of the Act if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We have completed our billing system sequence (i.e., we have sent you an initial notice of the overpayment, a reminder notice, and a past-due notice) or we have suspended or terminated collection activity under applicable rules, such as, the Federal Claims Collection Standards in 31 CFR 903.2 or 903.3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We have not entered into an installment payment arrangement with you or, if we have entered into such an arrangement, you have failed to make any payment for two consecutive months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You have not requested waiver pursuant to Sec. 416.550 or Sec. 416.582 or, after a review conducted pursuant to those sections, we have determined that we will not waive collection of the overpayment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You have not requested reconsideration of the initial overpayment determination pursuant to Secs. 416.1407 and 416.1409 or, after a review conducted pursuant to Sec. 416.1413, we have affirmed all or part of the initial overpayment determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> We cannot recover your overpayment pursuant to Sec. 416.570 by adjustment of benefits payable to any individual other than you. For purposes of this paragraph, if you are a member of an eligible couple that is legally separated and/or living apart, we will deem unrecoverable from the other person that part of your overpayment which he or she did not receive.
