                                Sec. 102-75.375  What happens once a State, or political subdivision,-of-way acquired for its construction to meet the requirements of a public or cooperative power project?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Generally, once a State or political subdivision certifies that it needs a surplus power transmission line and the right-of-way, the disposal agency may sell the property to the state, or political subdivision thereof, at the fair market value. However, if a sale of a surplus transmission line cannot be accomplished because of the price to be charged, or other reasons, and the certification by the State or political subdivision is not withdrawn, the disposal agency must report the facts involved to the Administrator of General Services, to determine what further action will or should be taken to dispose of the property.</p>
