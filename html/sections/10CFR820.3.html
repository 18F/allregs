After a respondent requests an on-the- record adjudication of an assessment of a civil penalty contained in a  Final Notice of Violation, no person shall participate in a decision- making function in an enforcement proceeding if he has been, is or will  be responsible for an investigative or prosecutorial function related to  that proceeding or if he reports to the person responsible for the  investigative or prosecutorial function.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Director. The Director shall be responsible for the  investigation and prosecution of violations of the DOE Nuclear Safety  Requirements. After the request for an enforcement adjudication, the  Director shall not discuss ex parte the merits of the proceeding with a  DOE Official or any person likely to advise the DOE Official in the  decision of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Presiding Officer. A Presiding Officer shall perform no duties  inconsistent with his responsibilities as a Presiding Officer, and will  not be responsible to or subject to the supervision or direction of any  officer or employee engaged in the performance of an investigative or  prosecutorial function. The Presiding Officer may not consult any person  other than a member of his staff or a special assistant on any fact at  issue unless on notice and opportunity for all parties to participate,  except as required for the disposition of ex parte matters as authorized  by law.</p>
