                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Peanut butter is the food prepared by grinding one of the shelled and roasted peanut ingredients provided for by paragraph (b) of this section, to which may be added safe and suitable seasoning and stabilizing ingredients provided for by paragraph (c) of this section, but such seasoning and stabilizing ingredients do not in the aggregate exceed 10 percent of the weight of the finished food. To the ground peanuts, cut or chopped, shelled, and roasted peanuts may be added. During processing, the oil content of the peanut ingredient may be adjusted by the addition or subtraction of peanut oil. The fat content of the finished food shall not exceed 55 percent when determined as prescribed in ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,'' 13th Ed. (1980), section 27.006(a) under ``Crude Fat--Official First Action, Direct Method,'' in paragraph (a), which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

Seasoning and stabilizing ingredients that perform a useful function are regarded as suitable, except that artificial flavorings, artificial sweeteners, chemical preservatives, and color additives are not suitable ingredients in peanut butter. Oil products used as optional stabilizing ingredients shall be hydrogenated vegetable oils. For the purposes of this section, hydrogenated vegetable oil shall be considered to include partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If peanut butter is prepared from unblanched peanuts as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the name shall show that fact by some such statement as ``prepared from unblanched peanuts (skins left on).'' Such statement shall appear prominently and conspicuously and shall be in type of the same style and not less than half of the point size of that used for the words ``peanut butter.'' This statement shall immediately precede or follow the words ``peanut butter,'' without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Label declaration. Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the

applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.
