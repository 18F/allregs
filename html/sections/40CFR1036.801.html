                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions apply to this part. The definitions apply to all subparts unless we note otherwise. All undefined terms have the meaning the Act gives to them. The definitions follow:</p><p class="depth0">Act means the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q.</p><p class="depth0">Adjustable parameter has the meaning given in 40 CFR part 86.</p><p class="depth0">Advanced technology means technology certified under Sec.  1036.615, 40 CFR 1037.104(d)(7) or 1037.615.</p><p class="depth0">Aftertreatment means relating to a catalytic converter, particulate filter, or any other system, component, or technology mounted downstream of the exhaust valve (or exhaust port) whose design function is to decrease emissions in the engine exhaust before it is exhausted to the environment. Exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR) and turbochargers are not aftertreatment.</p><p class="depth0">Aircraft means any vehicle capable of sustained air travel above treetop heights.</p><p class="depth0">Alcohol-fueled engine mean an engine that is designed to run using an alcohol fuel. For purposes of this definition, alcohol fuels do not include fuels with a nominal alcohol content below 25 percent by volume.</p><p class="depth0">Auxiliary emission control device means any element of design that senses temperature, motive speed, engine RPM, transmission gear, or any other parameter for the purpose of activating, modulating, delaying, or deactivating the operation of any part of the emission control system.</p><p class="depth0">Averaging set has the meaning given in Sec.  1036.740.</p><p class="depth0">Calibration means the set of specifications and tolerances specific to a particular design, version, or application of a component or assembly capable of functionally describing its operation over its working range.</p><p class="depth0">Carryover means relating to certification based on emission data generated from an earlier model year as described in Sec.  1036.235(d).</p><p class="depth0">Certification means relating to the process of obtaining a certificate of conformity for an engine family that complies with the emission standards and requirements in this part.</p><p class="depth0">Certified emission level means the highest deteriorated emission level in an engine family for a given pollutant from the applicable transient and/or steady-state testing, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the applicable standard. Note that you may have two certified emission levels for CO2 if you certify a family for both vocational and tractor use.</p><p class="depth0">Complete vehicle means a vehicle meeting the definition of complete vehicle in 40 CFR 1037.801 when it is first sold as a vehicle. For example, where a

vehicle manufacturer sells an incomplete vehicle to a secondary manufacturer, the vehicle is not a complete vehicle under this part, even after its final assembly.</p><p class="depth0">Compression-ignition means relating to a type of reciprocating, internal-combustion engine that is not a spark-ignition engine.</p><p class="depth0">Crankcase emissions means airborne substances emitted to the atmosphere from any part of the engine crankcase's ventilation or lubrication systems. The crankcase is the housing for the crankshaft and other related internal parts.</p><p class="depth0">Criteria pollutants means emissions of NOX, HC, PM, and CO. Note that these pollutants are also sometimes described collectively as ``non-greenhouse gas pollutants'', although they do not necessarily have negligible global warming potentials.</p><p class="depth0">Designated Compliance Officer means the Manager, Heavy-Duty and Nonroad Engine Group (6405-J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth0">Designated Enforcement Officer means the Director, Air Enforcement Division (2242A), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth0">Deteriorated emission level means the emission level that results from applying the appropriate deterioration factor to the official emission result of the emission-data engine. Note that where no deterioration factor applies, references in this part to the deteriorated emission level mean the official emission result.</p><p class="depth0">Deterioration factor means the relationship between emissions at the end of useful life (or point of highest emissions if it occurs before the end of useful life) and emissions at the low-hour/low-mileage test point, expressed in one of the following ways:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> For multiplicative deterioration factors, the ratio of emissions at the end of useful life (or point of highest emissions) to emissions at the low-hour test point.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> For additive deterioration factors, the difference between emissions at the end of useful life (or point of highest emissions) and emissions at the low-hour test point.</p><p class="depth0">Dual-fuel means relating to an engine designed for operation on two different types of fuel but not on a continuous mixture of those fuels.</p><p class="depth0">Emission control system means any device, system, or element of design that controls or reduces the emissions of regulated pollutants from an engine.</p><p class="depth0">Emission-data engine means an engine that is tested for certification.

The use of valve timing to increase the amount of residual exhaust gas in the combustion chamber(s) that is mixed with incoming air before or during combustion is not considered exhaust-gas recirculation for the purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Family certification level (FCL) means a CO2 emission level declared by the manufacturer that is at or above emission test results for all emission-data engines. The FCL serves as the emission standard for the engine family with respect to certification testing if it is different than the otherwise applicable standard. The FCL must be expressed to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard it replaces.</p><p class="depth0">Family emission limit (FEL) means an emission level declared by the manufacturer to serve in place of an otherwise applicable emission standard (other than CO2 standards) under the ABT program in subpart H of this part. The FEL must be expressed to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard it replaces. The FEL serves as the emission standard for the engine family with respect to all required testing except certification testing for CO2. The CO2 FEL is equal to the CO2 FCL multiplied by 1.03 and rounded to the same number of decimal places as the standard (e.g., the nearest whole g/hp-hr for the 2016 CO2 standards).</p><p class="depth0">Flexible-fuel means relating to an engine designed for operation on any mixture of two or more different types of fuels.</p><p class="depth0">Fuel type means a general category of fuels such as diesel fuel, gasoline, or natural gas.

For purposes of this definition in this part, the term ``engine'' includes internal combustion engines and other devices that convert chemical fuel into motive power. For example, a fuel cell used in a heavy-duty vehicle is a heavy-duty engine.</p><p class="depth0">Heavy-duty vehicle means any motor vehicle above 8,500 pounds GVWR or that has a vehicle curb weight above 6,000 pounds or that has a basic vehicle frontal area greater than 45 square feet. Curb weight has the meaning given in 40 CFR 86.1803, consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 1037.140. Basic vehicle frontal area has the meaning given in 40 CFR 86.1803.</p><p class="depth0">Hybrid engine or hybrid powertrain means an engine or powertrain that includes energy storage features other than a conventional battery system or conventional flywheel.
