However, the tribe has fewer investment options than it has when it  withdraws its funds completely from trust status. If a tribe chooses to  keep its funds in trust status, the tribe is subject to the same  statutory investment restrictions that bind us. That means that the  tribe's investments are limited to bank deposits and securities  guaranteed by the United States. (See 25 U.S.C. 162a for specific  statutory investment restrictions.)</p>
