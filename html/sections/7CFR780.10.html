                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A request for appeal to the State committee from a decision of a  county committee must be submitted by a participant or by a  participant's authorized representative in writing and addressed to the  State Executive Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A participant's right to appeal a decision to a State committee  is waived if a participant has appealed the adverse decision to NAD  before requesting an appeal to the State Committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a participant requests mediation or requests an appeal to NAD  before a request for an appeal to the State Committee has been acted  upon, the appeal to the State Committee will be deemed withdrawn. The  deemed withdrawal of a participant's appeal to the State Committee will  not preclude a subsequent request for a State Committee hearing on  appealable matters not resolved in mediation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in appeals to a State  committee. Notwithstanding, a State committee may confine presentations  of evidence to material facts and exclude evidence or questions as  irrelevant, unduly repetitious, or otherwise inappropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The official record of a State committee decision on an appeal  will be the decision letter that is issued following disposition of the  appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Deliberations shall be in confidence except to the extent that a  State committee may request the assistance of FSA employees during  deliberations.
