                                Sec. 1.114  Disclosure of requested information to individuals.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any agency which receives a request or appeal under Sec. 1.112 should acknowledge the request or appeal within 10 days of its receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Wherever practicable, the acknowledgment should indicate whether or not access will be granted and, if so, when and where. When access is to be granted, the agency should provide the access within 30 days of receipt of the request or appeal (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) unless, for good cause shown, it is unable to do so. If the agency is unable to meet this deadline, it shall inform the requester of this fact, the reasons for its inability to do so, and an estimate of the date on which access will be granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nothing in 5 U.S.C. 552a or this subpart shall be interpreted to require that an individual making a request under Sec. 1.112 be granted access to the physical record itself. The form in which a record is kept (e.g., on magnetic tape), or the content of the record (e.g., a record indexed under the name of the requester may contain records which are not about the requester) may require that the record be edited or translated in some manner. Neither of these procedures may be utilized, however, to withhold information in a record about the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No agency shall deny any request under Sec. 1.112 for information concerning the existence of records about the requester in any system of records it maintains, or deny any request for access to records about the requester in any system of records it maintains, unless that system is exempted from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) in Sec. 1.123.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If any agency receives a request pursuant to Sec. 1.112(a) for access to records in a system of records it maintains which is so exempted, the system manager shall determine if the exemption is to be asserted. If the system manager determines to deny the request, the system manager shall inform the requester of that determination, the reason for the determination, and the title and address of the agency head to whom the denial can be appealed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the head of an agency determines that an appeal pursuant to Sec. 1.112(b) is to be denied, the head of the agency shall inform the requester of that determination, the reason for the determination, and the requester's right under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) to seek judicial review of the denial in Federal district court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Nothing in 5 U.S.C. 552a or this subpart shall allow an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.
