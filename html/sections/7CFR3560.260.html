Loan applicants  or borrowers proposing to use rental subsidy from sources other than the  Agency must provide:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Documentation demonstrating that a market exists for households  eligible for the subsidy and the households are at income levels that  would benefit from the amount of rental subsidy that will be provided;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A plan describing actions to be taken when the rental subsidy  expires to minimize the impact on tenants losing the rental assistance  and to avoid displacement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A copy of the project-based rental assistance agreement to be  signed by the borrower and the provider of the rental assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rental subsidy agreement.
