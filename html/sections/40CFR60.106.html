Two samples of equal sampling times shall be taken at about 1-hour intervals. The arithmetic average of these two samples shall constitute a run. For most fuel gases, sampling times exceeding 20 minutes may result in depletion of the collection solution, although fuel gases containing low concentrations of H2S may necessitate sampling for longer periods of time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For Method 15 or 16, at least three injects over a 1-hour period shall constitute a run.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For Method 15A, a 1-hour sample shall constitute a run.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where emissions are monitored by Sec. 60.105(a)(3), compliance with Sec. 60.104(a)(1) shall be determined using Method 6 or 6C and Method 3 or 3A. The method ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,'' (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 6. A 1-hour sample shall constitute a run. Method 6 samples shall be taken at a rate of approximately 2 liters/min. The ppm correction factor (Method 6) and the sampling location in paragraph (f)(1) of this section apply. Method 4 shall be used to determine the moisture content of the gases. The sampling point for Method 4 shall be adjacent to the sampling point for Method 6 or 6C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the SO2 and the H2S and reduced sulfur standards in Sec. 60.104(a)(2) as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Method 6 shall be used to determine the SO2 concentration. The concentration in mg/dscm obtained by Method 6 or 6C is multiplied by 0.3754 to obtain the concentration in ppm. The sampling point in the duct shall be the centroid of the cross section if the

cross-sectional area is less than 5.00 m\2\ (53.8 ft\2\) or at a point no closer to the walls than 1.00 m (39.4 in.) if the cross-sectional area is 5.00 m\2\ or more and the centroid is more than 1 m from the wall. The sampling time and sample volume shall be at least 10 minutes and 0.010 dscm (0.35 dscf) for each sample. Eight samples of equal sampling times shall be taken at about 30-minute intervals. The arithmetic average of these eight samples shall constitute a run. For Method 6C, a run shall consist of the arithmetic average of four 1-hour samples. Method 4 shall be used to determine the moisture content of the gases. The sampling point for Method 4 shall be adjacent to the sampling point for Method 6 or 6C. The sampling time for each sample shall be equal to the time it takes for two Method 6 samples. The moisture content from this sample shall be used to correct the corresponding Method 6 samples for moisture. For documenting the oxidation efficiency of the control device for reduced sulfur compounds, Method 15 shall be used following the procedures of paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method 15 shall be used to determine the reduced sulfur and H2 S concentrations. Each run shall consist of 16 samples taken over a minimum of 3 hours. The sampling point shall be the same as that described for Method 6 in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. To ensure minimum residence time for the sample inside the sample lines, the sampling rate shall be at least 3.0 lpm (0.10 cfm). The SO2 equivalent for each run shall be calculated after being corrected for moisture and oxygen as the arithmetic average of the SO2 equivalent for each sample during the run. Method 4 shall be used to determine the moisture content of the gases as the paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The sampling time for each sample shall be equal to the time it takes for four Method 15 samples.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The oxygen concentration used to correct the emission rate for excess air shall be obtained by the integrated sampling and analysis procedure of Method 3 or 3A. The samples shall be taken simultaneously with the SO2, reduced sulfur and H2S, or moisture samples. The SO2, reduced sulfur, and H2S samples shall be corrected to zero percent excess air using the equation in paragraph (h)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each performance test conducted for the purpose of determining compliance under Sec. 60.104(b) shall consist of all testing performed over a 7-day period using Method 6 or 6C and Method 3 or 3A.
