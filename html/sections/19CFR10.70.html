                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In connection with the entry of purebred animals for breeding purposes under subheading 0101.11.00, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), no claim for free entry shall be allowed in liquidation of the entry until the port director has received from the Department of Agriculture a certificate, or its electronic equivalent, that the animal is purebred of a recognized breed and duly registered in a book of record recognized by the Secretary of Agriculture for that breed. Importers are required by regulation of the Department of Agriculture to make application for a certificate of pure breeding to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services, on ANH Form 17-338 before the animal will be examined as required by 9 CFR 151.7. Application for the certificate must be executed by the owner agent, or importer and filed at a port of entry designated in the regulations of the Department of Agriculture for the importation of animals (9 CFR 92.3). However, applications for certificates for dogs (other than dogs for handling livestock regulated under 9 CFR 92.18) and cats may be filed either at a designated port of entry or at any other port where Customs entry is made. The regulations of the Department of Agriculture prescribing the requirements for the issuance of certificates of pure breeding provide that all animals imported under such regulations must be accompanied to the port at which examination is to be made by certificates of pedigree and transfer of ownership, or their electronic equivalents, in order that identification may be accomplished, and that, if such animals are moved from such port prior to the presentation of such certificates and transfers, or their electronic equivalents, such action shall constitute a waiver of any further claim to certification under such regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the cases of cats and dogs arriving at Canadian border ports, Customs officers and employees are hereby authorized and directed to make the examination required by such regulations of the Department of Agriculture. Customs officers and employees are also authorized and directed to make such examinations at the ports of New York and Boston, provided the dog or cat is brought into the United States by a passenger. At all airports, Customs officers shall make the examination of dogs and cats, whether or not accompanied by the owners, if there is no inspector of the Department of Agriculture stationed there or on duty at the time of arrival.
