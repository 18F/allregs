                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. FNS and each State agency shall establish a management  evaluation system in order to assess the accomplishment of SFMNP  objectives as provided under these regulations, the State Plan, and the  written agreement with FNS. FNS will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide assistance to State agencies in discharging this  responsibility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish standards and procedures to determine how well the  objectives of this part are being accomplished; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Implement sanction procedures as warranted by State SFMNP  performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Responsibilities of FNS. FNS will establish evaluation  procedures to determine whether State agencies carry out the purposes  and provisions of this part, the State Plan, and the written agreement  with FNS. As a part of the evaluation procedure, FNS will review audits  to ensure that the SFMNP has been included in audit examinations at a  reasonable frequency. These evaluations shall also include reviews of  selected local agencies, and on-site reviews of selected farmers,  farmers' markets, roadside stands, and community supported agriculture  programs. These evaluations will measure the State agency's progress  toward meeting the objectives outlined in its State Plan and the State  agency's compliance with these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FNS may withhold up to 10 percent of the State agency's total  SFMNP grant if FNS determines that the State agency has:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Failed, without good cause, to demonstrate efficient and  effective administration of its SFMNP; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Failed to comply with the requirements contained in this  section or the State Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sanctions imposed upon a State agency by FNS in accordance with  this section (but not claims for repayment assessed against a State  agency) may   be appealed in accordance with the procedures established in  Sec. 249.20(a). Before carrying out any sanction against a State agency,  the following procedures will be followed:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> FNS will notify the chief departmental officer of the  administering agency in writing of the deficiencies found and of FNS'  intention to withhold administrative funds unless an acceptable  corrective action plan is submitted by the State agency to FNS within 45  days after mailing of notification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State agency shall develop a corrective action plan,  including timeframes for implementation to address the deficiencies and  prevent their future recurrence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the corrective action plan is acceptable, FNS will notify  the chief departmental officer of the administering agency in writing  within 30 days of receipt of the plan. The letter will advise the State  agency of the sanctions to be imposed if the corrective action plan is  not implemented according to the schedule set forth in the approved  plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Upon notification from the State agency that corrective action  has been taken, FNS will assess such action and, if necessary, perform a  follow-up review to determine if the noted deficiencies have been  corrected. FNS will then advise the State agency of whether the actions  taken are in compliance with the corrective action plan, and whether the  deficiency is resolved or further corrective action is needed.  Compliance buys can be required if, during FNS management evaluations by  regional offices, a State agency is found to be out of compliance with  its responsibility to monitor and review farmers, farmers' markets,  roadside stands, and community supported agriculture programs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If an acceptable corrective action plan is not submitted within  45 days, or if corrective action is not completed according to the  schedule established in the corrective action plan, FNS may withhold the  award of SFMNP administrative funds. If the 45-day warning period ends  in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year, FNS may elect not to withhold  funds until the next fiscal year. In such an event, FNS will notify the  chief departmental officer of the administering State agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If compliance is achieved before the end of the fiscal year in  which the SFMNP administrative funds are withheld, the funds withheld  may be restored to the State agency. FNS is not required to restore  funds withheld beyond the end of the fiscal year for which the funds  were initially awarded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responsibilities of State agencies. The State agency is  responsible for meeting the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State agency must establish evaluation and review procedures  and document the results of such procedures. The procedures must  include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conducting annual monitoring reviews of participating farmers'  markets, roadside stands, and community supported agriculture programs.  This includes on-site reviews of a minimum of 10 percent of farmers and  10 percent of each type of authorized outlet (farmers' markets, roadside  stands, and community supported agriculture programs), and includes  those farmers and authorized outlets identified as being at the highest  risk. The first year of operation in the SFMNP shall be considered a  high-risk indicator. More frequent reviews may be performed, as the  State agency deems necessary. In States where both the SFMNP and the WIC  Farmers' Market Nutrition Program are in operation, these reviews may be  coordinated to avoid duplication. A review by one program may be counted  by the other program toward the monitoring requirement, provided that  appropriate sanction action is taken for all violations found.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conducting monitoring reviews of all local agencies within the  State agency's jurisdiction at least once every 2 years. Monitoring of  local agencies shall encompass, but not be limited to, evaluation of  management, accountability, certification, nutrition education,  financial management systems, and coupon and/or CSA program management  systems. When the State agency conducts a local agency review outside of  the SFMNP season, a review of documents and procedural plans of the  SFMNP, rather than actual SFMNP activities, is acceptable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Instituting the necessary follow-up procedures to correct  identified problem areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On its own initiative or when required by FNS, the State agency  must provide special reports on SFMNP activities, and take positive  action to correct deficiencies in SFMNP operations.</p>
