                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Availability of interface information. Technical information  concerning interface parameters not specified by the technical criteria  published by the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments, that  are needed to permit terminal equipment to operate in a manner  compatible with the communications facilities of a provider of wireline  telecommunications, shall be provided by the provider of wireline  telecommunications upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Changes in the facilities, equipment, operations, or procedures  of a provider of wireline telecommunications. A provider of wireline  telecommunications may make changes in its communications facilities,  equipment, operations or procedures, where such action is reasonably  required in the operation of its business and is not inconsistent with  the rules and regulations in this part. If such changes can be  reasonably expected to render any customer's terminal equipment  incompatible with the communications facilities of the provider of  wireline telecommunications, or require modification or alteration of  such terminal equipment, or otherwise materially affect its use or  performance, the customer shall be given adequate notice in writing, to  allow the customer an opportunity to maintain uninterrupted service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Availability of inside wiring information. Any available  technical information concerning wiring on the customer side of the  demarcation point, including copies of existing schematic diagrams and  service records, shall be provided by the provider of wireline  telecommunications upon request of the building owner or agent thereof.  The provider of wireline telecommunications may charge the building  owner a reasonable fee for this service, which shall not exceed the cost  involved in locating and copying the documents. In the alternative, the  provider of wireline telecommunications may make these documents  available for review and copying by the building owner. In this case,  the provider of wireline telecommunications may charge a reasonable fee,  which shall not exceed the cost involved in making the documents  available, and may also require the building owner to pay a deposit to  guarantee the documents' return.
