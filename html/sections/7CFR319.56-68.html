                                Sec. 319.56-68  Female squash flowers from Israel.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Female squash flowers (Cucurbita pepo L.) may be imported into the  continental United States from Israel only in accordance with this  section and other applicable provisions of this subpart. These  conditions are designed to prevent the introduction of the following  quarantine pests: Ceratitis capitata, Dacus ciliatus, Helicoverpa  armigera, and Scirtothrips dorsalis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Production site requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Production sites in which the  female squash flowers are produced must be registered with the national  plant protection organization (NPPO) of Israel. Initial approval of  production sites must be completed jointly by the NPPO of Israel and  APHIS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The NPPO of Israel must visit and inspect the production sites.  APHIS may monitor the production sites if necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Production sites must be inside pest-exclusionary structures  (PES). The PES must have self-closing double   doors. All openings, including vents, to the outside of the PES must be  covered by screening with mesh openings of not more than 1.6 mm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mitigation measures for fruit flies (C. capitata and D.  ciliatus). </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The NPPO of Israel must set and maintain fruit fly traps  with an APHIS-approved bait at a rate of one trap per hectare, with a  minimum of one trap in each PES and one outside the entrance of each  PES. The NPPO of Israel must check the traps every 7 days and maintain  records of trap placement, trap maintenance, and captures of any fruit  flies of concern. The NPPO must maintain trapping records and make the  records available to APHIS upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Capture of a single fruit fly of concern inside a production  site will immediately result in cancellation of exports to the United  States from that production site. The detection of a fruit fly of  concern in a consignment at the port of entry that is traced back to a  production site will also result in immediate cancellation of exports to  the United States from that production site. In both cases, exports from  the production site in question may not resume until APHIS and the NPPO  of Israel have mutually determined that the risk has been properly  mitigated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Packinghouse requirements. While in use for exporting female  squash flowers to the United States, the packinghouses may only accept  flowers from registered production sites.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Post-harvest procedures. Before being removed from the PES,  harvested female squash flowers must be placed in field cartons or  containers that are marked to show the official registration number of  the production site. The place of production where the flowers were  grown must remain identifiable from the time when the blossoms leave the  production site, to the packinghouse, and through the export process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Commercial consignments. The female squash flowers may be  imported in commercial consignments only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Phytosanitary certificate. Each consignment must be accompanied  by a phytosanitary certificate issued by the NPPO of Israel with an  additional declaration stating that the consignment has been inspected  and found free of Ceratitis capitata, Dacus ciliatus, Helicoverpa  armigera, and Scirtothrips dorsalis.
