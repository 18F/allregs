                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services on September 27, 1996. These revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirement of section 182(c)(2)(B), and the contingency measure requirements of section 182(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, for the Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester serious area, and the New Hampshire portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester serious area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval--Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Protection on June 1, 1998. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the one-hour ozone attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act, for the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH serious ozone nonattainment area. The revision establishes a one-hour attainment date of November 15, 2007 for the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH serious ozone nonattainment area. This revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets of 10.72 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 21.37 tons per day of nitrogen oxides (NOX) to be used in transportation conformity in the New Hampshire portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH serious ozone nonattainment area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of Attainment. Effective March 18, 2008, EPA is determining that the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 8-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Approval--Revision to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services on May 28, 2008. This revision establishes Year 2009 motor vehicle emission budgets of 15.31

tons per summer day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 28.53 tons per summer day of nitrogen oxides (NOX) to be used in transportation conformity in the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination of Attainment. Effective April 18, 2011, EPA is determining that the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard based on 2007-2009 monitoring data. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply. In addition, this area met its June 15, 2010 attainment deadline for the 1997 ozone standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Determination of Attainment for the One-Hour Ozone Standard. Effective June 28, 2012, EPA is determining that the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, by the area's applicable attainment date of November 15, 2007, based on 2005-2007 complete, certified, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Determination of Attainment. Effective November 29, 2012, EPA is determining that the Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, by the area's applicable attainment date of November 15, 1999, based on 1997-1999 complete, certified, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area. Separate from and independent of this determination, EPA is determining that the Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester serious one-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the one-hour ozone standard since 1999 and continues to attain based on complete, quality-assured data ozone monitoring data through 2011.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Determination of Attainment. Effective November 29, 2012, EPA is determining that the Manchester one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, by the area's applicable attainment date of November 15, 1993, based on 1991-1993 complete, certified, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area. Separate from and independent of this determination, EPA is determining that the Manchester marginal one-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the one-hour ozone standard, since 1993, and that it continues to attain based on complete quality-assured ozone monitoring data through 2011.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Approval--EPA is approving a redesignation request for the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire moderate 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. New Hampshire submitted this request on March 2, 2012, and supplemented this submittal on September 21, 2012. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Elements of the section 175 maintenance plan include a contingency plan and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision as required by the Clean Air Act. The ozone maintenance plan also establishes 2008 and 2022 Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for the area. New Hampshire is establishing 2008 MVEBs of 17.8 tons per summer weekday (tpswd) of VOC and 37.2 tpswd of NOX, for the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 1997 8-hour ozone maintenance area. In addition, New Hampshire is establishing MVEBs for 2022 at 9.2 tpswd of VOC and 11.8 tpswd of NOX, for the same area. The 2008 and 2022 MVEBs were prepared with the MOVES model. Previously SIP-approved 2009 MVEBs prepared with MOBILE6.2 are being withdrawn. Finally, EPA is also approving a comprehensive 2008 emission inventory for this area.
