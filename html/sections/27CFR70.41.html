                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. An appropriate TTB officer may approve such reward  as he or she deems suitable for information that leads to the detection  and punishment of any person guilty of violating any tax law  administered by the Bureau or conniving at the same. The rewards  provided for by 26 U.S.C. 7623 are limited in their aggregate to the sum  appropriated therefor and shall be paid only in cases not otherwise  provided for by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility to file claim for reward--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Any  person, other than certain present or former federal employees (see  paragraph (b)(2) of this section), who submits, in the manner set forth  in paragraph (d) of this section, information relating to the violation  of tax laws administered and enforced by the Bureau, is eligible to file  a claim for reward under 26 U.S.C. 7623.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal employees. No person who was an officer or employee of  the Department of the Treasury at the time he came into possession of  information relating to violations of tax laws administered by the  Bureau, or at the time he divulged such information, shall be eligible  for reward under 26 U.S.C. 7623 and this section. Any other federal  employee, or former federal employee, is eligible to file a claim for  reward if the information submitted came to his knowledge other than in  the course of his official duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deceased informants. A claim for reward may be filed by an  executor, administrator, or other legal representative on behalf of a  deceased informant if, prior to his death, the informant was eligible to  file a claim for such reward under 26 U.S.C. 7623 and this section.  Certified copies of the letters testamentary, letters of administration,  or other similar evidence must be annexed to such a claim for reward on  behalf of a deceased informant in order to show the authority of the  legal representative to file the claim for reward.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amount and payment of reward. All relevant factors, including  the value of the information furnished in relation to the facts  developed by the investigation of the violation, must be taken   into account in determining whether a reward must be paid, and, if so,  the amount thereof. The amount of a reward shall represent what the  appropriate TTB officer deems to be adequate compensation in the  particular case, normally not to exceed 10 percent of the additional  taxes, penalties, and fines which are recovered as a result of the  information. No reward, however, shall be paid with respect to any  additional interest that may be collected. Payment of a reward will be  made as promptly as the circumstances of the case permit, but generally  not until the taxes, penalties, or fines involved have been collected.  However, the informant may waive any claim for reward with respect to an  uncollected portion of the taxes, penalties, or fines involved, in which  case the claim may be immediately processed. No person is authorized  under these regulations to make any offer, or promise, or otherwise to  bind the appropriate TTB officer with respect to the payment of any  reward or the amount thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Submission of information. Persons desiring to claim rewards  under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 7623 and this section may submit  information relating to violations of tax laws administered by the  Bureau to an appropriate TTB officer. If the information is submitted in  person, either orally or in writing, the name and official title of the  person to whom it is submitted and the date on which it is submitted  must be included in the formal claim for reward.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Anonymity. No unauthorized person shall be advised of the  identity of an informant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Filing claim for reward. An informant who intends to claim a  reward under 26 U.S.C. 7623 should notify the person to whom he submits  his information of such intention, and must file a formal claim, signed  with his true name, as soon after submission of the information as  practicable. If other than the informant's true name was used in  furnishing the information, the claimant must include with his claim  satisfactory proof of his identity as that of the informant. Claim for  reward under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 7623 must be made on TTB Form  3200.13. TTB Form 3200.13 should be obtained from the office where the  information is filed.
