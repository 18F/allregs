Cohort provisions, what will OWCP do once it determines that an employee contracted cancer?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Other than claims for a non-radiogenic cancer listed by HHS at 42 CFR 81.30, or claims seeking benefits under Part E of the Act that have previously been accepted under section 7384u of the Act, or claims previously accepted under Part B pursuant to the Special Exposure Cohort provisions, OWCP will forward the claim package (including, but not limited to, Forms EE-1, EE-2, EE-3, EE-4 and EE-5, as appropriate) to HHS for dose reconstruction. At that point in time, development of the claim by OWCP may be suspended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This package will include OWCP's initial findings in regard to the diagnosis and date of diagnosis of the employee, as well as any employment history compiled by OWCP (including information such as dates and locations worked, and job titles). The package, however, will not constitute either a recommended or final decision by OWCP on the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HHS will then reconstruct the radiation dose of the employee, after such further development of the employment history as it may deem necessary, and provide OWCP, DOE and the claimant with the final dose reconstruction report. The final dose reconstruction record will be delivered to OWCP with the final dose reconstruction report and to the claimant upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Following its receipt of the reconstructed dose from HHS, OWCP will resume its adjudication of the cancer claim and consider whether the claimant has met the eligibility criteria set forth in subpart C of this part. However, during the period before it receives a reconstructed dose from HHS, OWCP may continue to develop other aspects of a claim, to the extent that it deems such development to be appropriate.</p>
