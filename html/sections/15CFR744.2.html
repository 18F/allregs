                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(3)</em>  of this section: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Part 772 of the EAR defines ``knowledge'' for all of the EAR  except part 760, Restrictive Trade Practices and Boycotts. The  definition, which includes variants such as ``know'' and ``reason to  know'', encompasses more than positive knowledge. Thus, the use of  ``know'' in this section in place of the former wording ``know or have  reason to know'' does not lessen or otherwise change the  responsibilities of persons subject to the EAR. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Nuclear explosive activities. Nuclear explosive activities,  including research on or development, design, manufacture, construction,  testing or maintenance of any nuclear explosive device, or components or  subsystems of such a device. \2 3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Nuclear explosive devices and any article, material, equipment,  or device specifically designed or specially modified for use in the  design, development, or fabrication of nuclear weapons or nuclear  explosive devices are subject to export licensing or other requirements  of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, U.S. Department of State,  or the licensing or other restrictions specified in the Atomic Energy  Act of 1954, as amended. Similarly, items specifically designed or  specifically modified for use in devising, carrying out, or evaluating  nuclear weapons tests or nuclear explosions (except such items as are in  normal commercial use for other purposes) are subject to the same  requirements.</p><p class="depth0">\3\ Also see Sec. Sec. 744.5 and 748.4 of the EAR for special  provisions relating to technical data for maritime nuclear propulsion  plants and other commodities. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unsafeguarded nuclear activities. Activities including research  on, or development, design, manufacture, construction, operation, or  maintenance of any nuclear reactor, critical facility, facility for the  fabrication of nuclear fuel, facility for the conversion of nuclear  material from one chemical form to another, or separate storage  installation, where there is no obligation to accept International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards at the relevant facility or  installation when it contains any source or special fissionable material  (regardless of whether or not it contains such material at the time of  export), or where any such obligation is not met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Safeguarded and unsafeguarded nuclear activities. Safeguarded  and unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activities, including research on  or development, design, manufacture, construction, operation or  maintenance of any of the following facilities, or components for such  facilities: \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ Such activities may also require a specific authorization from  the Secretary of Energy pursuant to Sec. 57.b.(2) of the Atomic Energy  Act of 1954, as amended, as implemented by the Department of Energy's  regulations published in 10 CFR 810. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facilities for the chemical processing of irradiated special  nuclear or source material;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Facilities for the production of heavy water;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Facilities for the separation of isotopes of source and  special nuclear material; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Facilities for the fabrication of nuclear reactor fuel  containing plutonium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Additional prohibition on persons informed by BIS. BIS may  inform persons, either individually by specific notice or through  amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for a specific export,  reexport, or transfer (in-country), or for the export, reexport, or  transfer (in-country) of specified items to a certain end-user, because  there is an unacceptable risk of use in, or diversion to, the activities  specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Specific notice is to be  given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary  for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will  be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the  Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. However, the  absence of any such notification does not excuse persons from compliance  with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions. Despite the prohibitions described in paragraphs (a)  and (b) of this section, you may export technology subject to the EAR  under the operation technology and software or sales technology and  software provisions of License Exception TSU (see Sec. 740.13(a) and  (b)), but only to and for use in countries listed in Supplement No. 3 to  Part 744 of the EAR (Countries Not Subject to Certain Nuclear End-Use  Restrictions in Sec. 744.2(a)). Notwithstanding the provisions of Part  740 of the EAR, the provisions of Sec. 740.13(a) and (b) will only  overcome General Prohibition Five for countries listed in Supplement No.  3 to Part 744 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> License review standards. The following factors are among those  used by the United States to determine whether to grant or deny license  applications required under this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whether the commodities, software, or technology to be  transferred are appropriate for the stated end-use and whether that  stated end-use is appropriate for the end-user;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The significance for nuclear purposes of the particular  commodity, software, or technology;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whether the commodities, software, or technology to be exported  are to be used in research on or for the development, design,  manufacture, construction, operation, or maintenance of any reprocessing  or enrichment facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The types of assurances or guarantees given against use for  nuclear explosive purposes or proliferation in the particular case;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Whether the end-user has been engaged in clandestine or illegal  procurement activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Whether an application for a license to export to the end-user  has previously been denied, or whether the end-use has previously  diverted items received under a license, License Exception, or NLR to  unauthorized activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Whether the export would present an unacceptable risk of  diversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded nuclear fuel- cycle activity described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country, based  on consideration of the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether the importing country is a party to the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or to the Treaty for the Prohibition of  Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) (see Supplement  No. 2 to part 742 of the EAR), or to a similar international legally- binding nuclear nonproliferation agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the importing country has all of its nuclear  activities, facilities or installations that are operational, being  designed, or under construction, under International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) safeguards or equivalent full scope safeguards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether there is an agreement for cooperation in the civil  uses of atomic energy between the U.S. and the importing country;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the actions, statements, and policies of the government  of the importing country are in support of nuclear nonproliferation and  whether that government is in compliance with its international  obligations in the field of nonproliferation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The degree to which the government of the importing country  cooperates in nonproliferation policy generally (e.g., willingness to  consult on international nonproliferation issues);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Intelligence data on the importing country's nuclear intentions  and activities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Whether the recipient state has sufficient national export  controls (as described in paragraph 3 of United Nations Security Council  Resolution 1540 (2004)) to prevent an unacceptable risk of retransfer or  diversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded nuclear fuel- cycle activity described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR.
