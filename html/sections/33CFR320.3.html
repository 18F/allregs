                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1341) requires any  applicant for a federal license or permit to conduct any activity that  may result in a discharge of a pollutant into waters of the United  States to obtain a certification from the State in which the discharge  originates or would originate, or, if appropriate, from the interstate  water pollution control agency having jurisdiction over the affected   waters at the point where the discharge originates or would originate,  that the discharge will comply with the applicable effluent limitations  and water quality standards. A certification obtained for the  construction of any facility must also pertain to the subsequent  operation of the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Section 307(c) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as  amended (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)), requires federal agencies conducting  activities, including development projects, directly affecting a state's  coastal zone, to comply to the maximum extent practicable with an  approved state coastal zone management program. Indian tribes doing work  on federal lands will be treated as a federal agency for the purpose of  the Coastal Zone Management Act. The Act also requires any non-federal  applicant for a federal license or permit to conduct an activity  affecting land or water uses in the state's coastal zone to furnish a  certification that the proposed activity will comply with the state's  coastal zone management program. Generally, no permit will be issued  until the state has concurred with the non-federal applicant's  certification. This provision becomes effective upon approval by the  Secretary of Commerce of the state's coastal zone management program.  (See 15 CFR part 930.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Section 302 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries  Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1432), authorizes the Secretary of  Commerce, after consultation with other interested federal agencies and  with the approval of the President, to designate as marine sanctuaries  those areas of the ocean waters, of the Great Lakes and their connecting  waters, or of other coastal waters which he determines necessary for the  purpose of preserving or restoring such areas for their conservation,  recreational, ecological, or aesthetic values. After designating such an  area, the Secretary of Commerce shall issue regulations to control any  activities within the area. Activities in the sanctuary authorized under  other authorities are valid only if the Secretary of Commerce certifies  that the activities are consistent with the purposes of Title III of the  Act and can be carried out within the regulations for the sanctuary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321- 4347) declares the national policy to encourage a productive and  enjoyable harmony between man and his environment. Section 102 of that  Act directs that ``to the fullest extent possible: (1) The policies,  regulations, and public laws of the United States shall be interpreted  and administered in accordance with the policies set forth in this Act,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All agencies of the Federal Government shall * * * insure that  presently unquantified environmental amenities and values may be given  appropriate consideration in decision-making along with economic and  technical considerations * * *''. (See Appendix B of 33 CFR part 325.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 (16 U.S.C. 742a, et seq.), the  Migratory Marine Game-Fish Act (16 U.S.C. 760c-760g), the Fish and  Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661-666c) and other acts express  the will of Congress to protect the quality of the aquatic environment  as it affects the conservation, improvement and enjoyment of fish and  wildlife resources. Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970 transferred  certain functions, including certain fish and wildlife-water resources  coordination responsibilities, from the Secretary of the Interior to the  Secretary of Commerce. Under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act and  Reorganization Plan No. 4, any federal agency that proposes to control  or modify any body of water must first consult with the United States  Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service, as  appropriate, and with the head of the appropriate state agency  exercising administration over the wildlife resources of the affected  state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The Federal Power Act of 1920 (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.), as  amended, authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency (FERC) to issue  licenses for the construction and the operation and maintenance of dams,  water conduits, reservoirs, power houses, transmission lines, and other  physical structures of a hydro-power project. However, where such  structures will affect the navigable capacity of any navigable water of  the United States (as defined in 16   U.S.C. 796), the plans for the dam or other physical structures  affecting navigation must be approved by the Chief of Engineers and the  Secretary of the Army. In such cases, the interests of navigation should  normally be protected by a DA recommendation to FERC for the inclusion  of appropriate provisions in the FERC license rather than the issuance  of a separate DA permit under 33 U.S.C. 401 et seq. As to any other  activities in navigable waters not constituting construction and the  operation and maintenance of physical structures licensed by FERC under  the Federal Power Act of 1920, as amended, the provisions of 33 U.S.C.  401 et seq. remain fully applicable. In all cases involving the  discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States  or the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposal in  ocean waters, section 404 or section 103 will be applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470)  created the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to advise the  President and Congress on matters involving historic preservation. In  performing its function the Council is authorized to review and comment  upon activities licensed by the Federal Government which will have an  effect upon properties listed in the National Register of Historic  Places, or eligible for such listing. The concern of Congress for the  preservation of significant historical sites is also expressed in the  Preservation of Historical and Archeological Data Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C.  469 et seq.), which amends the Act of June 27, 1960. By this Act,  whenever a federal construction project or federally licensed project,  activity, or program alters any terrain such that significant historical  or archeological data is threatened, the Secretary of the Interior may  take action necessary to recover and preserve the data prior to the  commencement of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act (15 U.S.C. 1701 et  seq.) prohibits any developer or agent from selling or leasing any lot  in a subdivision (as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1701(3)) unless the purchaser  is furnished in advance a printed property report containing information  which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may, by rules or  regulations, require for the protection of purchasers. In the event the  lot in question is part of a project that requires DA authorization, the  property report is required by Housing and Urban Development regulation  to state whether or not a permit for the development has been applied  for, issued, or denied by the Corps of Engineers under section 10 or  section 404. The property report is also required to state whether or  not any enforcement action has been taken as a consequence of non- application for or denial of such permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) declares the  intention of the Congress to conserve threatened and endangered species  and the ecosystems on which those species depend. The Act requires that  federal agencies, in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, use their authorities  in furtherance of its purposes by carrying out programs for the  conservation of endangered or threatened species, and by taking such  action necessary to insure that any action authorized, funded, or  carried out by the Agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued  existence of such endangered or threatened species or result in the  destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is  determined by the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce, as appropriate,  to be critical. (See 50 CFR part 17 and 50 CFR part 402.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> The Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (33 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.)  prohibits the ownership, construction, or operation of a deepwater port  beyond the territorial seas without a license issued by the Secretary of  Transportation. The Secretary of Transportation may issue such a license  to an applicant if he determines, among other things, that the  construction and operation of the deepwater port is in the national  interest and consistent with national security and other national policy  goals and objectives. An application for a deepwater port license  constitutes an application for all federal authorizations required for  the ownership, construction,   and operation of a deepwater port, including applications for section  10, section 404 and section 103 permits which may also be required  pursuant to the authorities listed in Sec. 320.2 and the policies  specified in Sec. 320.4 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et  seq.) expresses the intent of Congress that marine mammals be protected  and encouraged to develop in order to maintain the health and stability  of the marine ecosystem. The Act imposes a perpetual moratorium on the  harassment, hunting, capturing, or killing of marine mammals and on the  importation of marine mammals and marine mammal products without a  permit from either the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of  Commerce, depending upon the species of marine mammal involved. Such  permits may be issued only for purposes of scientific research and for  public display if the purpose is consistent with the policies of the  Act. The appropriate Secretary is also empowered in certain restricted  circumstances to waive the requirements of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Section 7(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1278  et seq.) provides that no department or agency of the United States  shall assist by loan, grant, license, or otherwise in the construction  of any water resources project that would have a direct and adverse  effect on the values for which such river was established, as determined  by the Secretary charged with its administration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> The Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Act of 1980, (42 U.S.C.  section 9101 et seq.) establishes a licensing regime administered by the  Administrator of NOAA for the ownership, construction, location, and  operation of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) facilities and  plantships. An application for an OTEC license filed with the  Administrator constitutes an application for all federal authorizations  required for ownership, construction, location, and operation of an OTEC  facility or plantship, except for certain activities within the  jurisdiction of the Coast Guard. This includes applications for section  10, section 404, section 103 and other DA authorizations which may be  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Section 402 of the Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to issue  permits under procedures established to implement the National Pollutant  Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program. The administration of this  program can be, and in most cases has been, delegated to individual  states. Section 402(b)(6) states that no NPDES permit will be issued if  the Chief of Engineers, acting for the Secretary of the Army and after  consulting with the U.S. Coast Guard, determines that navigation and  anchorage in any navigable water will be substantially impaired as a  result of a proposed activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> The National Fishing Enhancement Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-623)  provides for the development of a National Artificial Reef Plan to  promote and facilitate responsible and effective efforts to establish  artificial reefs. The Act establishes procedures to be followed by the  Corps in issuing DA permits for artificial reefs. The Act also  establishes the liability of the permittee and the United States. The  Act further creates a civil penalty for violation of any provision of a  permit issued for an artificial reef.</p>
