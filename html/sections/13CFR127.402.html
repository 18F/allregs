                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification. No less than five (5) business days before  commencing an examination, SBA will notify the concern in writing that  it will conduct an examination to verify the status of the concern as an  EDWOSB or WOSB. However, SBA reserves the right to conduct a site visit  without prior notification to the concern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Request for information. SBA will request that the concern or  contracting officer provide documentation and information related to the  concern's EDWOSB or WOSB eligibility. These documents will include those  submitted under Sec. 127.300 and any other pertinent documents requested  by SBA at the time of eligibility examination to verify eligibility,  including but not limited to, documents submitted by a concern in  connection with any WOSB or EDWOSB certification. SBA may also request  copies of proposals or bids submitted in response to an EDWOSB or WOSB  solicitation. In addition, EDWOSBs will be required to submit signed  copies of SBA Form 413, Personal Financial Statement, the three most  recent personal income tax returns (including all schedules and W-2  forms) for the women claiming economic disadvantage and their spouses,  unless the individuals and their spouses are legally separated, and SBA  Form 4506-T, Request for Tax Transcript Form, available to the public at  http://www.sba.gov/tools/Forms/index.html. SBA may draw an adverse  inference where a concern fails to cooperate in providing the requested  information. The WOSB or EDWOSB must retain documentation demonstrating  satisfaction of the eligibility requirements for six (6) years from date  of self-certification.</p>
