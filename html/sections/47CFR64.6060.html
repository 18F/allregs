Appendix A to Part 64--Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP)</p><p class="depth0">System for National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP)</p><p class="depth0">1. Purpose and Authority</p><p class="depth0">a. This appendix establishes policies and procedures and assigns  responsibilities for the National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP)  Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) System. The NSEP TSP System  authorizes priority treatment to certain domestic telecommunications  services (including portions of U.S. international telecommunication  services provided by U.S. service vendors) for which provisioning or  restoration priority (RP) levels are requested, assigned, and approved  in accordance with this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">b. This appendix is issued pursuant to sections 1, 4(i), 201 through  205 and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  151, 154(i), 201 through 205 and 303(r). These sections grant to the  Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the authority over the  assignment and approval of priorities for provisioning and restoration  of common carrier-provided telecommunications services. Under section  706 of the Communications Act, this authority may be superseded, and  expanded to include non-common carrier telecommunication services, by  the war emergency powers of the President of the United States. This  appendix provides the Commission's Order to telecommunication service  vendors and users to comply with policies and procedures establishing  the NSEP TSP System, until such policies and procedures are superseded  by the President's war emergency powers. This appendix is intended to be  read in conjunction with regulations and procedures that the Executive  Office of the President issues (1) to implement responsibilities  assigned in section 6(b) of this appendix, or (2) for use in the event  this appendix is superseded by the President's war emergency powers.</p><p class="depth0">c. Together, this appendix and the regulations and procedures issued  by the Executive Office of the President establish one uniform system of  priorities for provisioning and restoration of NSEP telecommunication  services both before and after invocation of the President's war  emergency powers. In order that government and industry resources may be  used effectively under all conditions, a single set of rules,  regulations, and procedures is necessary, and they must be applied on a  day-to-day basis to all NSEP services so that the priorities they  establish can be implemented at once when the need arises.</p><p class="depth0">* In sections 2(a)(2) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order No. 12472,  ``Assignment of National Security and Emergency Preparedness  Telecommunications Functions'' April 3, 1984 (49 FR 13471 (1984)), the  President assigned to the Director, Office of Science and Technology  Policy, certain NSEP telecommunication resource management  responsibilities. The term ``Executive Office of the President'' as used  in this appendix refers to the official or organization designated by  the President to act on his behalf.</p><p class="depth0">2. Applicability and Revocation</p><p class="depth0">a. This appendix applies to NSEP telecommunications services:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For which initial or revised priority level assignments are  requested pursuant to section 8 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Which were assigned restoration priorities under the provision  of FCC Order 80-581; 81 FCC 2d 441 (1980); 47 CFR part 64, appendix A,  ``Priority System for the Restoration of Common Carrier Provided  Intercity Private Line Services''; and are being resubmitted for  priority level assignments pursuant to section 10 of this appendix.  (Such services will retain assigned restoration priorities until a  resubmission for a TSP assignment is completed or until the existing RP  rules are terminated.)</p><p class="depth0">b. FCC Order 80-581 will continue to apply to all other intercity,  private line circuits assigned restoration priorities thereunder until  the fully operating capability date of this appendix, 30 months after  the initial operating capability date referred to in subsection d of  this section.</p><p class="depth0">c. In addition, FCC Order, ``Precedence System for Public  Correspondence Services Provided by the Communications Common Carriers''  (34 FR 17292 (1969)); (47 CFR part 64, appendix B), is revoked as of the  effective date of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">d. The initial operating capability (IOC) date for NSEP TSP will be  nine months after release in the Federal Register of the FCC's order  following review of procedures submitted by the Executive Office of the  President. On this IOC date requests for priority assignments generally  will be accepted only by the Executive Office of the President.</p><p class="depth0">3. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">As used in this part:</p><p class="depth0">a. Assignment means the designation of priority level(s) for a  defined NSEP telecommunications service for a specified time period.</p><p class="depth0">b. Audit means a quality assurance review in response to identified  problems.</p><p class="depth0">c. Government refers to the Federal government or any foreign,  state, county, municipal or other local government agency or  organization. Specific qualifications will be supplied whenever  reference to a particular level of government is intended (e.g.,  ``Federal government'', ``state government''). ``Foreign government''  means any sovereign empire, kingdom, state, or independent political  community, including foreign diplomatic and consular establishments and  coalitions or associations of governments (e.g., North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO), Southeast Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO),  Organization of American States (OAS), and government agencies or  organization (e.g., Pan American Union, International Postal Union, and  International Monetary Fund)).</p><p class="depth0">d. National Communications System (NCS) refers to that organization  established by the President in Executive Order No. 12472, ``Assignment  of National Security and Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications  Functions,'' April 3, 1984, 49 FR 13471 (1984).</p><p class="depth0">e. National Coordinating Center (NCC) refers to the joint  telecommunications industry-Federal government operation established by  the National Communications System to assist in the initiation,  coordination, restoration, and reconstitution of NSEP telecommunication  services or facilities.</p><p class="depth0">f. National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP)  telecommunications services, or ``NSEP services,'' means  telecommunication services which are used to maintain a state of  readiness or to respond to and manage any event or crisis (local,  national, or international), which causes or could cause injury or harm  to the population, damage to or loss of property, or degrades or  threatens the NSEP posture of the United States. These services fall  into two specific categories, Emergency NSEP and Essential NSEP, and are  assigned priority levels pursuant to section 9 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">g. NSEP treatment refers to the provisioning of a telecommunication  service before others based on the provisioning priority level assigned  by the Executive Office of the President.</p><p class="depth0">h. Priority action means assignment, revision, revocation, or  revalidation by the Executive Office of the President of a priority  level associated with an NSEP telecommunications service.</p><p class="depth0">i. Priority level means the level that may be assigned to an NSEP  telecommunications service specifying the order in which provisioning or  restoration of the service is to occur relative to other NSEP and/or  non-NSEP telecommunication services. Priority levels authorized by this  appendix are designated (highest to lowest) ``E,'' ``1,'' ``2,'' ``3,''  ``4,'' and ``5,'' for provisioning and ``1,'' ``2,'' ``3,'' ``4,'' and  ``5,'' for restoration.</p><p class="depth0">j. Priority level assignment means the priority level(s) designated  for the provisioning and/or restoration of a particular NSEP  telecommunications service under section 9 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">k. Private NSEP telecommunications services include non-common  carrier telecommunications services including private line, virtual  private line, and private switched network services.</p><p class="depth0">l. Provisioning means the act of supplying telecommunications  service to a user, including all associated transmission, wiring and  equipment. As used herein, ``provisioning'' and ``initiation'' are  synonymous and include altering the state of an existing priority  service or capability.</p><p class="depth0">m. Public switched NSEP telecommunications services include those  NSEP telecommunications services utilizing public switched networks.  Such services may include both interexchange and intraexchange network  facilities (e.g., switching systems, interoffice trunks and subscriber  loops).</p><p class="depth0">n. Reconciliation means the comparison of NSEP service information  and the resolution of identified discrepancies.</p><p class="depth0">o. Restoration means the repair or returning to service of one or  more telecommunication services that have experienced a service outage  or are unusable for any reason, including a damaged or impaired  telecommunications facility. Such repair or returning to service may be  done by patching, rerouting, substitution of component parts or  pathways, and other means, as determined necessary by a service vendor.</p><p class="depth0">p. Revalidation means the rejustification by a service user of a  priority level assignment. This may result in extension by the Executive  Office of the President of the expiration date associated with the  priority level assignment.</p><p class="depth0">q. Revision means the change of priority level assignment for an  NSEP telecommunications service. This includes any extension of an  existing priority level assignment to an expanded NSEP service.</p><p class="depth0">r. Revocation means the elimination of a priority level assignment  when it is no longer valid. All priority level assignments for an NSEP  service are revoked upon service termination.</p><p class="depth0">s. Service identification refers to the information uniquely  identifying an NSEP telecommunications service to the service vendor  and/or service user.</p><p class="depth0">t. Service user refers to any individual or organization (including  a service vendor) supported by a telecommunications service for which a  priority level has been requested or assigned pursuant to section 8 or 9  of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">u. Service vendor refers to any person, association, partnership,  corporation, organization, or other entity (including common carriers  and government organizations) that offers to supply any  telecommunications equipment, facilities, or services (including  customer premises equipment and wiring) or combination thereof. The term  includes resale carriers, prime contractors, subcontractors, and  interconnecting carriers.</p><p class="depth0">v. Spare circuits or services refers to those not being used or  contracted for by any customer.</p><p class="depth0">w. Telecommunication services means the transmission, emission, or  reception of signals, signs, writing, images, sounds, or intelligence of  any nature, by wire, cable, satellite, fiber optics, laser, radio,  visual or other electronic, electric, electromagnetic, or acoustically  coupled means, or any combination thereof. The term can include  necessary telecommunication facilities.</p><p class="depth0">x. Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) system user refers to  any individual, organization, or activity that interacts with the NSEP  TSP System.</p><p class="depth0">4. Scope</p><p class="depth0">a. Domestic NSEP services. The NSEP TSP System and procedures  established by this appendix authorize priority treatment to the  following domestic telecommunication services (including portions of  U.S. international telecommunication services provided by U.S. vendors)  for which provisioning or restoration priority levels are requested,  assigned, and approved in accordance with this appendix:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Common carrier services which are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Interstate or foreign telecommunications services,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Intrastate telecommunication services inseparable from  interstate or foreign telecommunications services, and intrastate  telecommunication services to which priority levels are assigned  pursuant to section 9 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Initially, the NSEP TSP System's applicability to public  switched services is limited to (a) provisioning of such services (e.g.,  business, centrex, cellular, foreign exchange, Wide Area Telephone  Service (WATS) and other services that the selected vendor is able to  provision) and (b) restoration of services that the selected vendor is  able to restore.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Services which are provided by government and/or non-common  carriers and are interconnected to common carrier services assigned a  priority level pursuant to section 9 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">b. Control services and orderwires. The NSEP TSP System and  procedures established by this appendix are not applicable to authorize  priority treatment to control services or orderwires owned by a service  vendor and needed for provisioning, restoration, or maintenance of other  services owned by that service vendor. Such control services and  orderwires shall have priority provisioning and restoration over all  other telecommunication services (including NSEP services) and shall be  exempt from preemption. However, the NSEP TSP System and procedures   established by this appendix are applicable to control services or  orderwires leased by a service vendor.</p><p class="depth0">c. Other services. The NSEP TSP System may apply, at the discretion  of and upon special arrangements by the NSEP TSP System users involved,  to authorize priority treatment to the following telecommunication  services:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Government or non-common carrier services which are not  connected to common carrier provided services assigned a priority level  pursuant to section 9 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Portions of U.S. international services which are provided by  foreign correspondents. (U.S. telecommunication service vendors are  encouraged to ensure that relevant operating arrangements are consistent  to the maximum extent practicable with the NSEP TSP System. If such  arrangements do not exist, U.S. telecommunication service vendors should  handle service provisioning and/or restoration in accordance with any  system acceptable to their foreign correspondents which comes closest to  meeting the procedures established in this appendix.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Policy</p><p class="depth0">The NSEP TSP System is the regulatory, administrative, and  operational system authorizing and providing for priority treatment,  i.e., provisioning and restoration, of NSEP telecommunication services.  As such, it establishes the framework for telecommunication service  vendors to provision, restore, or otherwise act on a priority basis to  ensure effective NSEP telecommunication services. The NSEP TSP System  allows the assignment of priority levels to any NSEP service across  three time periods, or stress conditions: Peacetime/Crisis/ Mobilizations, Attack/War, and Post-Attack/Recovery. Although priority  levels normally will be assigned by the Executive Office of the  President and retained by service vendors only for the current time  period, they may be preassigned for the other two time periods at the  request of service users who are able to identify and justify in  advance, their wartime or post-attack NSEP telecommunication  requirements. Absent such preassigned priority levels for the Attack/War  and Post-Attack/Recovery periods, priority level assignments for the  Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization period will remain in effect. At all  times, priority level assignments will be subject to revision by the FCC  or (on an interim basis) the Executive Office of the President, based  upon changing NSEP needs. No other system of telecommunication service  priorities which conflicts with the NSEP TSP System is authorized.</p><p class="depth0">6. Responsibilities</p><p class="depth0">a. The FCC will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Provide regulatory oversight of implementation of the NSEP TSP  System.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Enforce NSEP TSP System rules and regulations, which are  contained in this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Act as final authority for approval, revision, or disapproval of  priority actions by the Executive Office of the President and adjudicate  disputes regarding either priority actions or denials of requests for  priority actions by the Executive Office of the President, until  superseded by the President's war emergency powers under section 706 of  the Communications Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Function (on a discretionary basis) as a sponsoring Federal  organization. (See section 6(c) below.)</p><p class="depth0">b. The Executive Office of the President will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> During exercise of the President's war emergency powers under  section 706 of the Communications Act, act as the final approval  authority for priority actions or denials of requests for priority  actions, adjudicating any disputes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Until the exercise of the President's war emergency powers,  administer the NSEP TSP System which includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Receiving, processing, and evaluating requests for priority  actions from service users, or sponsoring Federal government  organizations on behalf of service users (e.g., Department of State or  Defense on behalf of foreign governments, Federal Emergency Management  Agency on behalf of state and local governments, and any Federal  organization on behalf of private industry entities). Action on such  requests will be completed within 30 days of receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assigning, revising, revalidating, or revoking priority levels  as necessary or upon request of service users concerned, and denying  requests for priority actions as necessary, using the categories and  criteria specified in section 12 of this appendix.

These reports will be  due by April 30th for the preceding July through December and by October  31 for the preceding January through June time periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> All reports submitted to the FCC should be directed to Chief,  Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, Washington, DC 20554.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Function (on a discretionary basis) as a sponsoring Federal  organization. (See section 6(c) below.)</p><p class="depth0">c. Sponsoring Federal organizations will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Review and decide whether to sponsor foreign, state, and local  government and private industry (including telecommunication service  vendors) requests for priority actions. Federal organizations will  forward sponsored requests with recommendations for disposition to the  Executive Office of the President. Recommendations will be based on the  categories and criteria in section 12 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Forward notification of priority actions or denials of requests  for priority actions from the Executive Office of the President to the  requesting foreign, state, and local government and private industry  entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cooperate with the Executive Office of the President during  reconciliation, revalidation, and audits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Comply with any regulations and procedures supplemental to and  consistent with this appendix which are issued by the Executive Office  of the President.</p><p class="depth0">d. Service users will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identify services requiring priority level assignments and  request and justify priority level assignments in accordance with this  appendix and any supplemental regulations and procedures issued by the  Executive Office of the President that are consistent with this  appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Request and justify revalidation of all priority level  assignments at least every three years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For services assigned priority levels, ensure (through  contractual means or otherwise) availability of customer premises  equipment and wiring necessary for end-to-end service operation by the  service due date, and continued operation; and, for such services in the  Emergency NSEP category, by the time that vendors are prepared to  provide the services. Additionally, designate the organization  responsible for the service on an end-to-end basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Be prepared to accept services assigned priority levels by the  service due dates or, for services in the Emergency NSEP category, when  they are available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Pay vendors any authorized costs associated with services that  are assigned priority levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Report to vendors any failed or unusable services that are  assigned priority levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Designate a 24-hour point-of-contact for matters concerning each  request for priority action and apprise the Executive Office of the  President thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Upon termination of services that are assigned priority levels,  or circumstances warranting revisions in priority level assignment  (e.g., expansion of service), request and justify revocation or  revision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> When NSEP treatment is invoked under section 9(c) of this  appendix, within 90 days following provisioning of the service involved,  forward to the National Coordinating Center (see section 3(e) of this  appendix) complete information identifying the time and event associated  with the invocation and regarding whether the NSEP service requirement  was adequately handled and whether any additional charges were incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Cooperate with the Executive Office of the President during  reconciliation, revalidation, and audits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Comply with any regulations and procedures supplemental to and  consistent with this appendix that are issued by the Executive Office of  the President.</p><p class="depth0">e. Non-federal service users, in addition to responsibilities  prescribed above in section 6(d), will obtain a sponsoring Federal  organization for all requests for priority actions. If   unable to find a sponsoring Federal organization, a non-federal service  user may submit its request, which must include documentation of  attempts made to obtain a sponsor and reasons given by the sponsor for  its refusal, directly to the Executive Office of the President.</p><p class="depth0">f. Service vendors will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When NSEP treatment is invoked by service users, provision NSEP  telecommunication services before non-NSEP services, based on priority  level assignments made by the Executive Office of the President.  Provisioning will require service vendors to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Allocate resources to ensure best efforts to provide NSEP  services by the time required. When limited resources constrain response  capability, vendors will address conflicts for resources by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Providing NSEP services in order of provisioning priority level  assignment (i.e., ``E'', ``1'', ``2'', ``3'', ``4'', or ``5'');</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Providing Emergency NSEP services (i.e., those assigned  provisioning priority level ``E'') in order of receipt of the service  requests;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Providing Essential NSEP services (i.e., those assigned  priority levels ``1'', ``2'', ``3'', ``4'', or ``5'') that have the same  provisioning priority level in order of service due dates; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Referring any conflicts which cannot be resolved (to the mutual  satisfaction of servicer vendors and users) to the Executive Office of  the President for resolution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Comply with NSEP service requests by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Allocating resources necessary to provide Emergency NSEP  services as soon as possible, dispatching outside normal business hours  when necessary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ensuring best efforts to meet requested service dates for  Essential NSEP services, negotiating a mutually (customer and vendor)  acceptable service due date when the requested service due date cannot  be met; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Seeking National Coordinating Center (NCC) assistance as  authorized under the NCC Charter (see section 1.3, NCC Charter, dated  October 9, 1985).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Restore NSEP telecommunications services which suffer outage, or  are reported as unusable or otherwise in need of restoration, before  non-NSEP services, based on restoration priority level assignments.  (Note: For broadband or multiple service facilities, restoration is  permitted even though it might result in restoration of services  assigned no or lower priority levels along with, or sometimes ahead of,  some higher priority level services.)

Preemption of Existing Services</p><p class="depth0">When necessary to provision or restore NSEP services, service  vendors may preempt services they provide as specified below. ``User''  as used in this Section means any user of a telecommunications service,  including both NSEP and non-NSEP services. Prior consent by a preempted  user is not required.</p><p class="depth0">a. The sequence in which existing services may be preempted to  provision NSEP services assigned a provisioning priority level ``E'' or  restore NSEP services assigned a restoration priority level from ``1''  through ``5'':</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Non-NSEP services: If suitable spare services are not available,  then, based on the considerations in this appendix and the service  vendor's best judgment, non-NSEP services will be preempted. After  ensuring a sufficient number of public switched services are available  for public use, based on the service vendor's best judgment, such  services may be used to satisfy a requirement for provisioning or  restoring NSEP services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> NSEP services: If no suitable spare or non-NSEP services are  available, then existing NSEP services may be preempted to provision or  restore NSEP services with higher priority level assignments. When this  is necessary, NSEP services will be selected for preemption in the  inverse order of priority level assignment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Service vendors who are preempting services will ensure their  best effort to notify the service user of the preempted service and  state the reason for and estimated duration of the preemption.</p><p class="depth0">b. Service vendors may, based on their best judgment, determine the  sequence in which existing services may be preempted to provision NSEP  services assigned a provisioning priority of ``1'' through ``5''.  Preemption is not subject to the consent of the user whose service will  be preempted.</p><p class="depth0">8. Requests for Priority Assignments.</p><p class="depth0">All service users are required to submit requests for priority  actions through the Executive Office of the President in the format and  following the procedures prescribed by that Office.</p><p class="depth0">9. Assignment, Approval, Use, and Invocation of Priority Levels</p><p class="depth0">a. Assignment and approval of priority levels. Priority level  assignments will be based upon the categories and criteria specified in  section 12 of this appendix. A priority level assignment made by the  Executive Office of the President will serve as that Office's  recommendation to the FCC. Until the President's war emergency powers  are invoked, priority level assignments must be approved by the FCC.  However, service vendors are ordered to implement any priority level  assignments that are pending FCC approval.</p><p class="depth0">After invocation of the President's war emergency powers, these  requirements may be superseded by other procedures issued by the  Executive Office of the President.</p><p class="depth0">b. Use of Priority Level Assignments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All provisioning and restoration priority level assignments for  services in the Emergency NSEP category will be included in initial  service orders to vendors. Provisioning priority level assignments for  Essential NSEP services, however, will not usually be included in  initial service orders to vendors. NSEP treatment for Essential NSEP  services will be invoked and provisioning priority level assignments  will be conveyed to service vendors only if the vendors cannot meet  needed service dates through the normal provisioning process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any revision or revocation of either provisioning or restoration  priority level assignments will also be transmitted to vendors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Service vendors shall accept priority levels and/or revisions  only after assignment by the Executive Office of the President.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Service vendors acting as prime contractors will accept  assigned NSEP priority levels only when they are accompanied by the  Executive Office of the President designated service identification,  i.e., TSP Authorization Code. However, service vendors are authorized to  accept priority levels and/or revisions from users and contracting  activities before assignment by the Executive Office of the President  when service vendor, user, and contracting activities are unable to  communicate with either the Executive Office of the President or the  FCC. Processing of Emergency NSEP service requests will not be delayed  for verification purposes.</p><p class="depth0">c. Invocation of NSEP treatment. To invoke NSEP treatment for the  priority provisioning of an NSEP telecommunications service, an  authorized Federal official either within, or acting on behalf of, the  service user's organization must make a written or oral declaration to  concerned service vendor(s) and the Executive Office of the President  that NSEP treatment is being invoked. Authorized Federal officials  include the head or director of a Federal agency, commander of a  unified/specified military command, chief of a military service, or  commander of a major military command; the delegates of any of the  foregoing; or any other officials as specified in supplemental  regulations or procedures issued by the Executive Office of the  President. The authority to invoke NSEP treatment may be delegated only  to a general or flag officer of a military service, civilian employee of  equivalent grade (e.g., Senior Executive Service member), Federal  Coordinating Officer or Federal Emergency Communications Coordinator/ Manager, or any other such officials specified in supplemental  regulations or procedures issued by the Executive Office of the  President. Delegates must be designated as such in writing, and written  or oral invocations must be accomplished, in accordance with  supplemental regulations or procedures issued by the Executive Office of  the President.</p><p class="depth0">10. Resubmission of Circuits Presently Assigned Restoration Priorities</p><p class="depth0">All circuits assigned restoration priorities must be reviewed for  eligibility for initial restoration priority level assignment under the  provisions of this appendix. Circuits currently assigned restoration  priorities, and for which restoration priority level assignments are  requested under section 8 of this appendix, will be resubmitted to the  Executive Office of the President. To resubmit such circuits, service  users will comply with applicable provisions of section 6(d) of this  appendix.</p><p class="depth0">11. Appeal</p><p class="depth0">Service users or sponsoring Federal organizations may appeal any  priority level assignment, denial, revision, revocation, approval, or  disapproval to the Executive Office of the President within 30 days of  notification to the service user. The appellant must use the form or  format required by the Executive Office of the President and must serve  the FCC with a copy of its appeal. The Executive Office of the President  will act on the appeal within 90 days of receipt. Service users and  sponsoring Federal organizations may only then appeal directly to the  FCC. Such FCC appeal must be filed within 30 days of notification of the  Executive Office of the President's decision on appeal. Additionally,  the Executive Office of the President may appeal any FCC revisions,  approvals, or disapprovals to the FCC. All appeals to the FCC must be  submitted using the form or format required. The party filing its appeal  with the FCC must include factual details supporting its claim and must  serve a copy on the Executive Office of the President and any other  party directly involved. Such party may file a response within 20 days,  and replies may be filed within 10 days thereafter. The Commission will  not issue public notices of such submissions. The Commission will  provide notice of its decision to the parties of record. Any appeals to  the Executive Office of the President that include a claim of new  information that has not been presented before for consideration may be  submitted at any time.</p><p class="depth0">12. NSEP TSP System Categories, Criteria, and Priority Levels</p><p class="depth0">a. General. NSEP TSP System categories and criteria, and permissible  priority level assignments, are defined and explained below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Essential NSEP category has four subcategories: National  Security Leadership; National Security Posture and U.S. Population  Attack Warning; Public Health, Safety, and Maintenance of Law and Order;  and Public Welfare and Maintenance of National Economic Posture. Each  subcategory has its own criteria. Criteria are also shown for the  Emergency NSEP category, which has no sub-categories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Priority levels of ``1,'' ``2,'' ``3,'' ``4,'' and ``5'' may be  assigned for provisioning and/or restoration of Essential NSEP  telecommunication services. However, for Emergency NSEP  telecommunications services, a priority level ``E'' is assigned for  provisioning. A restoration priority level from ``1'' through ``5'' may  be assigned if an Emergency NSEP service also qualifies for such a  restoration priority level under the Essential NSEP category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The NSEP TSP System allows the assignment of priority levels to  any NSEP   telecommunications service across three time periods, or stress  conditions: Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization, Attack/War, and Post-Attack/ Recovery. Priority levels will normally be assigned only for the first  time period. These assigned priority levels will apply through the onset  of any attack, but it is expected that they would later be revised by  surviving authorized telecommunication resource managers within the  Executive Office of the President based upon specific facts and  circumstances arising during the Attack/War and Post-Attack/Recovery  time periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Service users may, for their own internal use, assign  subpriorities to their services assigned priority levels. Receipt of and  response to any such subpriorities is optional for service vendors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The following paragraphs provide a detailed explanation of the  categories, subcategories, criteria, and priority level assignments,  beginning with the Emergency NSEP category.</p><p class="depth0">b. Emergency NSEP. Telecommunications services in the Emergency NSEP  category are those new services so critical as to be required to be  provisioned at the earliest possible time, without regard to the costs  of obtaining them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Criteria. To qualify under the Emergency NSEP category, the  service must meet criteria directly supporting or resulting from at  least one of the following NSEP functions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Federal government activity responding to a Presidentially  declared disaster or emergency as defined in the Disaster Relief Act (42  U.S.C. 5122).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> State or local government activity responding to a  Presidentially declared disaster or emergency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Response to a state of crisis declared by the National Command  Authorities (e.g., exercise of Presidential war emergency powers under  section 706 of the Communications Act.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Efforts to protect endangered U.S. personnel or property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Response to an enemy or terrorist action, civil disturbance,  natural disaster, or any other unpredictable occurrence that has damaged  facilities whose uninterrupted operation is critical to NSEP or the  management of other ongoing crises.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Certification by the head or director of a Federal agency,  commander of a unified/specified command, chief of a military service,  or commander of a major military command, that the telecommunications  service is so critical to protection of life and property or to NSEP  that it must be provided immediately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> A request from an official authorized pursuant to the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. and 18 U.S.C.  2511, 2518, 2519).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Priority Level Assignment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Services qualifying under the Emergency NSEP category are  assigned priority level ``E'' for provisioning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> After 30 days, assignments of provisioning priority level ``E''  for Emergency NSEP services are automatically revoked unless extended  for another 30-day period. A notice of any such revocation will be sent  to service vendors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c))</em>. Emergency NSEP services not otherwise  qualifying for restoration priority level assignment as Essential NSEP  may be assigned a restoration priority level ``5'' for a 30-day period.  Such 30-day restoration priority level assignments will be revoked  automatically unless extended for another 30-day period. A notice of any  such revocation will be sent to service vendors.</p><p class="depth0">c. Essential NSEP. Telecommunication services in the Essential NSEP  category are those required to be provisioned by due dates specified by  service users, or restored promptly, normally without regard to  associated overtime or expediting costs. They may be assigned priority  level of ``1,'' ``2,'' ``3,'' ``4,'' or ``5'' for both provisioning and  restoration, depending upon the nature and urgency of the supported  function, the impact of lack of service or of service interruption upon  the supported function, and, for priority access to public switched  services, the user's level of responsibility. Priority level assignments  will be valid for no more than three years unless revalidated. To be  categorized as Essential NSEP, a telecommunications service must qualify  under one of the four following subcategories: National Security  Leadership; National Security Posture and U.S. Population Attack  Warning; Public Health, Safety and Maintenance of Law and Order; or  Public Welfare and Maintenance of National Economic Posture. (Note Under  emergency circumstances, Essential NSEP telecommunication services may  be recategorized as Emergency NSEP and assigned a priority level ``E''  for provisioning.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> National security leadership. This subcategory will be strictly  limited to only those telecommunication services essential to national  survival if nuclear attack threatens or occurs, and critical orderwire  and control services necessary to ensure the rapid and efficient  provisioning or restoration of other NSEP telecommunication services.  Services in this subcategory are those for which a service interruption  of even a few minutes would have serious adverse impact upon the  supported NSEP function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Criteria. To qualify under this subcategory, a service must be  at least one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Critical orderwire, or control service, supporting other NSEP  functions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Presidential communications service critical to continuity of  government and national leadership during crisis situations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> National Command Authority communications service for military  command and control critical to national survival.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Intelligence communications service critical to warning of  potentially catastrophic attack.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Communications service supporting the conduct of diplomatic  negotiations critical to arresting or limiting hostilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Priority level assignment. Services under this subcategory will  normally be assigned priority level ``1'' for provisioning and  restoration during the Peace/Crisis/Mobilization time period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> National security posture and U.S. population attack warning.  This subcategory covers those minimum additional telecommunication  services essential to maintaining an optimum defense, diplomatic, or  continuity-of-government postures before, during, and after crises  situations. Such situations are those ranging from national emergencies  to international crises, including nuclear attack. Services in this  subcategory are those for which a service interruption ranging from a  few minutes to one day would have serious adverse impact upon the  supported NSEP function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Criteria. To qualify under this subcategory, a service must  support at least one of the following NSEP functions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Threat assessment and attack warning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conduct of diplomacy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Collection, processing, and dissemination of intelligence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Command and control of military forces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Military mobilization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Continuity of Federal government before, during, and after  crises situations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Continuity of state and local government functions supporting  the Federal government during and after national emergencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Recovery of critical national functions after crises  situations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> National space operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Priority level assignment. Services under this subcategory will  normally be assigned priority level ``2,'' ``3,'' ``4,'' or ``5'' for  provisioning and restoration during Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Public health, safety, and maintenance of law and order. This  subcategory covers the minimum number of telecommunication services  necessary for giving civil alert to the U.S. population and maintaining  law and order and the health and safety of the U.S. population in times  of any national, regional, or serious local emergency. These services  are those for which a service interruption ranging from a few minutes to  one day would have serious adverse impact upon the supported NSEP  functions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Criteria. To qualify under this subcategory, a service must  support at least one of the following NSEP functions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Population warning (other than attack warning).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Law enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Continuity of critical state and local government functions  (other than support of the Federal government during and after national  emergencies).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Hospitals and distributions of medical supplies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Critical logistic functions and public utility services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Civil air traffic control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Military assistance to civil authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Defense and protection of critical industrial facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Critical weather services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Transportation to accomplish the foregoing NSEP functions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Priority level assignment. Service under this subcategory will  normally be assigned priority levels ``3,'' ``4,'' or ``5'' for  provisioning and restoration during Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Public welfare and maintenance of national economic posture.  This subcategory covers the minimum number of telecommunications  services necessary for maintaining the public welfare and national  economic posture during any national or regional emergency. These  services are those for which a service interruption ranging from a few  minutes to one day would have serious adverse impact upon the supported  NSEP function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Criteria. To qualify under this subcategory, a service must  support at least one of the following NSEP functions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Distribution of food and other essential supplies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Maintenance of national monetary, credit, and financial  systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Maintenance of price, wage, rent, and salary stabilization,  and consumer rationing programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Control of production and distribution of strategic materials  and energy supplies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Prevention and control of environmental hazards or damage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Transportation to accomplish the foregoing NSEP functions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Priority level assignment. Services under this subcategory will  normally be assigned priority levels ``4'' or ``5'' for provisioning and  restoration during Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization.</p><p class="depth0">d. Limitations. Priority levels will be assigned only to the minimum  number of telecommunication services required to support an NSEP  function. Priority levels will not normally be assigned to backup  services on a   continuing basis, absent additional justification, e.g., a service user  specifies a requirement for physically diverse routing or contracts for  additional continuity-of-service features. The Executive Office of the  President may also establish limitations upon the relative numbers of  services which may be assigned any restoration priority level. These  limitations will not take precedence over laws or executive orders. Such  limitations shall not be exceeded absent waiver by the Executive Office  of the President.</p><p class="depth0">e. Non-NSEP services. Telecommunication services in the non-NSEP  category will be those which do not meet the criteria for either  Emergency NSEP or Essential NSEP.

Appendix B to Part 64--Priority Access Service (PAS) for National</p><p class="depth0">Security and Emergency Preparedness (NSEP)</p><p class="depth0">1. Authority</p><p class="depth0">This appendix is issued pursuant to sections 1, 4(i), 201 through  205 and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Under  these sections, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) may permit  the assignment and approval of priorities for access to commercial  mobile radio service (CMRS) networks. Under section 706 of the  Communications Act, this authority may be superseded by the war  emergency powers of the President of the United States. This appendix  provides the Commission's Order to CMRS providers and users to comply  with policies and procedures establishing the Priority Access Service  (PAS). This appendix is intended to be read in conjunction with  regulations and procedures that the Executive Office of the President  issues:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To implement responsibilities assigned in section 3 of this  appendix, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For use in the event this appendix is superseded by the  President's emergency war powers. Together, this appendix and the  regulations and procedures issued by the Executive Office of the  President establish one uniform system of priority access service both  before and after invocation of the President's emergency war powers.</p><p class="depth0">2. Background</p><p class="depth0">a. Purpose. This appendix establishes regulatory authorization for  PAS to support the needs of NSEP CMRS users.</p><p class="depth0">b. Applicability. This appendix applies to the provision of PAS by  CMRS licensees to users who qualify under the provisions of section 5 of  this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">c. Description. PAS provides the means for NSEP telecommunications  users to obtain priority access to available radio channels when  necessary to initiate emergency calls. It does not preempt calls in  progress and is to be used during situations when CMRS network  congestion is blocking NSEP call attempts. PAS is to be available to  authorized NSEP users at all times in equipped CMRS markets where the  service provider has voluntarily decided to provide such service.  Authorized users would activate the feature on a per call basis by  dialing a feature code such as *XX. PAS priorities 1 through 5 are  reserved for qualified and authorized NSEP users, and those users are  provided access to CMRS channels before any other CMRS callers.</p><p class="depth0">d. Definitions. As used in this appendix:</p><p class="depth0">1. Authorizing agent refers to a Federal or State entity that  authenticates, evaluates and makes recommendations to the Executive  Office of the President regarding the assignment of priority access  service levels.</p><p class="depth0">2. Service provider means an FCC-licensed CMRS provider. The term  does not include agents of the licensed CMRS provider or resellers of  CMRS service.</p><p class="depth0">3. Service user means an individual or organization (including a  service provider) to whom or which a priority access assignment has been  made.</p><p class="depth0">4. The following terms have the same meaning as in Appendix A to  Part 64:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Assignment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Government;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> National Communications System;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> National Coordinating Center;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP)  Telecommunications Services (excluding the last sentence);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Reconciliation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Revalidation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Revision;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Revocation.</p><p class="depth0">e. Administration. The Executive Office of the President will  administer PAS.</p><p class="depth0">3. Responsibilities</p><p class="depth0">a. The Federal Communications Commission will provide regulatory  oversight of the implementation of PAS, enforce PAS rules and  regulations, and act as final authority for approval, revision, or  disapproval of priority assignments by the Executive Office of the  President by adjudicating disputes regarding either priority assignments  or the denial thereof by the Executive Office of the President until  superseded by the President's war emergency powers under Section 706 of  the Communications Act.</p><p class="depth0">b. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) will administer the  PAS system. It will:</p><p class="depth0">1. Act as the final approval or denial authority for the assignment  of priorities and   the adjudicator of disputes during the exercise of the President's war  emergency powers under section 706 of the Communications Act.</p><p class="depth0">2. Receive, process, and evaluate requests for priority actions from  authorizing agents on behalf of service users or directly from service  users. Assign priorities or deny requests for priority using the  priorities and criteria specified in section 5 of this appendix. Actions  on such requests should be completed within 30 days of receipt.</p><p class="depth0">3. Convey priority assignments to the service provider and the  authorizing agent.</p><p class="depth0">4. Revise, revalidate, reconcile, and revoke priority level  assignments with service users and service providers as necessary to  maintain the viability of the PAS system.</p><p class="depth0">5. Maintain a database for PAS related information.</p><p class="depth0">6. Issue new or revised regulations, procedures, and instructional  material supplemental to and consistent with this appendix regarding the  operation, administration, and use of PAS.</p><p class="depth0">7. Provide training on PAS to affected entities and individuals.</p><p class="depth0">8. Enlarge the role of the Telecommunications Service Priority  System Oversight Committee to include oversight of the PAS system.</p><p class="depth0">9. Report periodically to the FCC on the status of PAS.</p><p class="depth0">10. Disclose content of the NSEP PAS database only as may be  required by law.</p><p class="depth0">c. An Authorizing agent shall:</p><p class="depth0">1. Identify itself as an authorizing agent and its community of  interest (State, Federal Agency) to the EOP. State Authorizing Agents  will provide a central point of contact to receive priority requests  from users within their state. Federal Authorizing Agents will provide a  central point of contact to receive priority requests from federal users  or federally sponsored entities.</p><p class="depth0">2. Authenticate, evaluate, and make recommendations to the EOP to  approve priority level assignment requests using the priorities and  criteria specified in section 5 of this appendix. As a guide, PAS  authorizing agents should request the lowest priority level that is  applicable and the minimum number of CMRS services required to support  an NSEP function. When appropriate, the authorizing agent will recommend  approval or deny requests for PAS.</p><p class="depth0">3. Ensure that documentation is complete and accurate before  forwarding it to the EOP.</p><p class="depth0">4. Serve as a conduit for forwarding PAS information from the EOP to  the service user and vice versa. Information will include PAS requests  and assignments, reconciliation and revalidation notifications, and  other information.</p><p class="depth0">5. Participate in reconciliation and revalidation of PAS information  at the request of the EOP.</p><p class="depth0">6. Comply with any regulations and procedures supplemental to and  consistent with this appendix that are issued by the EOP.</p><p class="depth0">7. Disclose content of the NSEP PAS database only to those having a  need-to-know.</p><p class="depth0">d. Service users will:</p><p class="depth0">1. Determine the need for and request PAS assignments in a planned  process, not waiting until an emergency has occurred.</p><p class="depth0">2. Request PAS assignments for the lowest applicable priority level  and minimum number of CMRS services necessary to provide NSEP  telecommunications management and response functions during emergency/ disaster situations.</p><p class="depth0">3. Initiate PAS requests through the appropriate authorizing agent.  The EOP will make final approval or denial of PAS requests and may  direct service providers to remove PAS if appropriate. (Note: State and  local government or private users will apply for PAS through their  designated State government authorizing agent. Federal users will apply  for PAS through their employing agency. State and local users in states  where there has been no designation will be sponsored by the Federal  agency concerned with the emergency function as set forth in Executive  Order 12656. If no authorizing agent is determined using these criteria,  the EOP will serve as the authorizing agent.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Submit all correspondence regarding PAS to the authorizing agent.</p><p class="depth0">5. Invoke PAS only when CMRS congestion blocks network access and  the user must establish communications to fulfill an NSEP mission. Calls  should be as brief as possible so as to afford CMRS service to other  NSEP users.</p><p class="depth0">6. Participate in reconciliation and revalidation of PAS information  at the request of the authorizing agent or the EOP.</p><p class="depth0">7. Request discontinuance of PAS when the NSEP qualifying criteria  used to obtain PAS is no longer applicable.</p><p class="depth0">8. Pay service providers as billed for PAS.</p><p class="depth0">9. Comply with regulations and procedures that are issued by the EOP  which are supplemental to and consistent with this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">e. Service providers who offer any form of priority access service  for NSEP purposes shall provide that service in accordance with this  appendix. As currently described in the Priority Access and Channel  Assignment Standard (IS-53-A), service providers will:</p><p class="depth0">1. Provide PAS levels 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 only upon receipt of an  authorization from the EOP and remove PAS for specific users at the  direction of the EOP.</p><p class="depth0">2. Ensure that PAS system priorities supersede any other NSEP  priority which may be provided.</p><p class="depth0">3. Designate a point of contact to coordinate with the EOP regarding  PAS.</p><p class="depth0">4. Participate in reconciliation and revalidation of PAS information  at the request of the EOP.</p><p class="depth0">5. As technically and economically feasible, provide roaming service  users the same grade of PAS provided to local service users.</p><p class="depth0">6. Disclose content of the NSEP PAS database only to those having a  need-to-know or who will not use the information for economic advantage.</p><p class="depth0">7. Comply with regulations and procedures supplemental to and  consistent with this appendix that are issued by the EOP.</p><p class="depth0">8. Insure that at all times a reasonable amount of CMRS spectrum is  made available for public use.</p><p class="depth0">9. Notify the EOP and the service user if PAS is to be discontinued  as a service.</p><p class="depth0">f. The Telecommunications Service Priority Oversight Committee will  identify and review any systemic problems associated with the PAS system  and recommend actions to correct them or prevent their recurrence.</p><p class="depth0">4. Appeal</p><p class="depth0">Service users and authorizing agents may appeal any priority level  assignment, denial, revision or revocation to the EOP within 30 days of  notification to the service user. The EOP will act on the appeal within  90 days of receipt. If a dispute still exists, an appeal may then be  made to the FCC within 30 days of notification of the EOP's decision.  The party filing the appeal must include factual details supporting its  claim and must provide a copy of the appeal to the EOP and any other  party directly involved. Involved parties may file a response to the  appeal made to the FCC within 20 days, and the initial filing party may  file a reply within 10 days thereafter. The FCC will provide notice of  its decision to the parties of record. Until a decision is made, the  service will remain status quo.</p><p class="depth0">5. PAS Priority Levels and Qualifying Criteria</p><p class="depth0">The following PAS priority levels and qualifying criteria apply  equally to all users and will be used as a basis for all PAS  assignments.
