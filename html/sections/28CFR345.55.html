                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an inmate  earns longevity pay raises after 18 months spent in FPI work status  regardless of whether or not the work was continuous. The service may  have occurred in one or more FPI factories or shops. An inmate qualifies  for longevity pay raises as provided in the table below:</p><p class="depth2">Length of Service With FPI  After 18 months of service and payable in the 19th month After 30 months of service and payable in the 31st month After 42 months of service and payable in the 43rd month After 60 months of service and payable in the 61st month After 84 months of service (& more) and payable in the 85th month   Longevity pay allowances shall be added after the wages for each actual  hour in pay status have been properly computed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FPI work status during service of a previous  sentence with a subsequent break in custody may not be considered in  determining longevity pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An inmate in segregation or who is given a disciplinary transfer  loses any longevity status previously achieved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An inmate who voluntarily transfers to a non-FPI work assignment  loses any longevity status previously achieved. An inmate who leaves FPI  to enter education, vocational training, or drug abuse treatment  programs, however, generally retains longevity and pay grade status upon  return to FPI, unless the inmate withdraws from those programs without a  good faith effort to complete them. The decision on whether there was a  good faith effort is to be made by the SOI in concert with the staff  member in charge of the program.</p>
