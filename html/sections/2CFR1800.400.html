Upon request, the recipient shall furnish the Grant Officer a description of such procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their effectiveness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The recipient will disclose each reportable item to the New Technology Representative, with notice to the Grant Officer, within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to recipient personnel responsible for the administration of this New Technology term and condition or, if earlier, within six months after the recipient becomes aware that a reportable item has been made, but in any event for subject inventions before any on sale, public use, or publication of such invention known to the recipient. The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the award under which the reportable item was made and the inventor(s) or innovator(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding, to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and physical, chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the reportable item. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale, or public use of any subject invention and whether a manuscript describing such invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure.

To avoid this bar, agencies may withhold information from the public that discloses any invention in which the Government owns or may own a right, title, or interest (including a nonexclusive license) (see 35 U.S.C. 205 and 37 CFR part 401). Agencies may only withhold information concerning inventions for a reasonable time in order for a patent application to be filed.

Unless provided otherwise, no recipient that receives title to any subject invention and no assignee of any such recipient shall grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement may be waived by the Administrator upon a showing by the recipient or assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</p><p class="depth0">(End of Term and Condition)</p><p class="depth0">1800.924 Designation of New Technology Representative and Patent</p><p class="depth0">Representative</p><p class="depth0">Prescription--The Grant Officer shall include this term and condition all awards containing the term and condition ``Patent Rights'' at 1800.908 or the term and condition ``New Technology'' at 1800.923.</p><p class="depth0">Designation of New Technology Representative and Patent Representative</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of administration of the term and condition entitled ``New Technology,'' or ``Patent Rights'' whichever is included, the following named representatives are hereby designated by the Grant Officer to administer such term and condition--</p><p class="depth0">New Technology Representative</p><p class="depth0">Patent Representative</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reports of reportable items, and disclosure of subject inventions, interim reports, final reports, utilization reports, and other reports required by the term and condition, as well as any correspondence with respect to such matters, should be directed to the New Technology Representative, with notification to the Grant Officer, unless transmitted in response to correspondence or request from the Patent Representative.
