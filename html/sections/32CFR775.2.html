                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Action proponent. The commander, commanding officer, or civilian director of a unit, activity, or organization who initiates a proposal for action, as defined in 40 CFR 1508.23, and who has command and control authority over the action once it is authorized. For some actions, the action proponent will also serve as the decision-making authority for that action. In specific circumstances, the action proponent and decision maker may be identified in Navy Regulations, other SECNAV Instructions, operational instructions and orders, acquisition instructions, and other sources which set out authority and responsibility within the DON.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). An environmental document prepared according to the requirements of Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508) for a major action that will have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Environmental Assessment (EA). A concise document prepared according to the requirements of 40 CFR parts 1500-1508 that briefly provides sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS. An EA aids compliance with NEPA when no EIS is necessary and facilitates preparation of an EIS when one is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Categorical Exclusion (CATEX). A published category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant impact on the human environment under normal circumstances, and, therefore, do not require either an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Record of Decision (ROD). An environmental document signed by an appropriate official of the DON. A ROD sets out a concise summary of the final decision and selected measures for mitigation (if any) of adverse environmental impacts of the alternative chosen from those considered in an EIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). A document that sets out the reasons why an action not otherwise categorically excluded will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and for which an EIS will not therefore be prepared. A FONSI will include the EA or a summary of it and shall note any other environmental documents related to it. A FONSI may be one result of review of an EA.
