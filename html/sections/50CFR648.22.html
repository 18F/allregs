                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Initial recommended annual specifications. The Atlantic  Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Monitoring Committee (Monitoring  Committee) shall meet annually to develop and recommend the following  specifications for consideration by the Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish  Committee of the MAFMC:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Initial OY (IOY), including Research Set-Aside (RSA), DAH, and  DAP for Illex squid, which, subject to annual review, may be specified  for a period of up to 3 years;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ACL; ACT including RSA, DAH, DAP; bycatch level of the TALFF, if  any; and butterfish mortality cap for the longfin squid fishery for  butterfish; which, subject to annual review, may be specified for a  period of up to 3 years;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ACL; commercial ACT, including RSA, DAH, Tier 3 allocation (up  to 7 percent of the DAH), DAP; JVP if any; TALFF, if any; and  recreational ACT, including RSA for mackerel; which, subject to annual  review, may be specified for a period of up to 3 years. The Monitoring  Committee may also recommend that certain ratios of TALFF, if any, for  mackerel to purchases of domestic harvested fish and/or domestic  processed fish be established in relation to the initial annual amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> IOY, including RSA, DAH, and DAP for longfin squid, which,  subject to annual review, may be specified for a period of up to 3  years; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Inseason adjustment, upward or downward, to the specifications  for longfin squid, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Guidelines. As the basis for its recommendations under paragraph  (a) of this section, the Monitoring Committee shall review the best  available data to recommend specifications consistent with the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Longfin and/or Illex squid. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The ABC for any fishing year  must be either the maximum OY, or a lower amount, if stock assessments  indicate that the potential yield is less than the maximum OY. The OYs  specified during a fishing year may not exceed the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Longfin squid--The catch associated with a fishing mortality  rate of FThreshold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Illex--Catch associated with a fishing mortality rate of  FMSY.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> IOY is a modification of ABC based on social and economic  factors. The IOY is composed of RSA and DAH. RSA will be based on  requests for research quota as described in paragraph (g) of this  section. DAH will be set after deduction for RSA, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mackerel--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ABC. The MAFMC's SSC shall recommend a stock-wide  ABC to the MAFMC, as described in Sec. 648.20. The stock-wide mackerel  ABC is reduced from the OFL based on an adjustment for scientific  uncertainty; the stock-wide ABC must be less than or equal to the OFL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ACL. The ACL or Domestic ABC is calculated using the formula  ACL/Domestic ABC = stock-wide ABC - C, where C is the estimated catch of  mackerel in Canadian waters for the upcoming fishing year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> OY. OY may not exceed the ACL, and must take into account the  need to prevent overfishing while allowing the fishery to achieve OY on  a continuing basis. OY is prescribed on the basis of MSY, as reduced by  social, economic, and ecological factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> ACT. The Monitoring Committee shall identify and review  relevant sources of management uncertainty to recommend ACTs for the  commercial and recreational fishing sectors as part of the  specifications process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Commercial sector ACT. Commercial ACT is composed of RSA, DAH,  Tier 3 allocation (up to 7 percent of DAH), dead discards, and TALFF, if  any. RSA will be based on requests for research quota as described in  paragraph (g) of this section. DAH, Tier 3 allocation (up to 7 of the  DAH), DAP, and JVP will be set after deduction for   RSA, if applicable, and must be projected by reviewing data from sources  specified in paragraph (b) of this section and other relevant data,  including past domestic landings, projected amounts of mackerel  necessary for domestic processing and for joint ventures during the  fishing year, projected recreational landings, and other data pertinent  for such a projection. The JVP component of DAH is the portion of DAH  that domestic processors either cannot or will not use. Economic  considerations for the establishment of JVP and TALFF include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Total world export potential of mackerel producing countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Total world import demand of mackerel consuming countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> U.S. export potential based on expected U.S. harvests, expected  U.S. consumption, relative prices, exchange rates, and foreign trade  barriers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Increased/decreased revenues to the U.S. from foreign fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Increased/decreased revenues to U.S. harvesters (with/without  joint ventures).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Increased/decreased revenues to U.S. processors and exporters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Increases/decreases in U.S. harvesting productivity due to  decreases/increases in foreign harvest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Increases/decreases in U.S. processing productivity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Potential impact of increased/decreased TALFF on foreign  purchases of U.S. products and services and U.S.-caught fish, changes in  trade barriers, technology transfer, and other considerations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Recreational sector ACT. Recreational ACT is composed of RSA,  dead discards, and the Recreational Harvest Limit (RHL).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Performance review. The Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish  Committee shall conduct a detailed review of fishery performance  relative to the mackerel ACL at least every 5 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the ACL is exceeded with a frequency greater than 25 percent  (i.e., more than once in 4 years or any two consecutive years), the  Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish Monitoring Committee will review fishery  performance information and make recommendations to the MAFMC for  changes in measures intended to ensure ACLs are not exceeded as  frequently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The MAFMC may specify more frequent or more specific ACL  performance review criteria as part of a stock rebuilding plan following  a determination that a stock has become overfished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Performance reviews shall not substitute for annual reviews that  occur to ascertain if prior year ACLs have been exceeded, but may be  conducted in conjunction with such reviews.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> River herring and shad catch cap. The Monitoring Committee  shall provide recommendations regarding a cap on the catch of river  herring (alewife and blueback) and shad (American and hickory) in the  Atlantic mackerel fishery based on best available scientific  information, as well as measures (seasonal or regional quotas, closure  thresholds) necessary for implementation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Butterfish--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ABC. The MAFMC's SSC shall recommend an ABC to  the MAFMC, as described in Sec. 648.20. The butterfish ABC is reduced  from the OFL based on an adjustment for scientific uncertainty; the ABC  must be less than or equal to the OFL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ACL. The butterfish ACL will be set equal to the butterfish  ABC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> OY. OY may not exceed the ACL, and must take into account the  need to prevent overfishing while allowing the fishery to achieve OY on  a continuing basis. OY is prescribed on the basis of MSY, as reduced by  social, economic, and ecological factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> ACT. The Monitoring Committee shall identify and review  relevant sources of management uncertainty to recommend the butterfish  ACT as part of the specifications process. The ACT is composed of RSA,  DAH, dead discards, and bycatch TALFF that is equal to 0.08 percent of  the allocated portion of the mackerel TALFF. RSA will be based on  requests for research quota as described in paragraph (g) of this  section. DAH and bycatch TALFF will be set after deduction for RSA, if  applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The butterfish mortality cap will be based on a portion of the  ACT (set annually during specifications) and the specified cap amount  will be allocated   to the longfin squid fishery as follows: Trimester I--43 percent;  Trimester II--17 percent; and Trimester III--40 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Any underages of the cap for Trimester I that are greater than  25 percent of the Trimester I cap will be reallocated to Trimester II  and III (split equally between both trimesters) of the same year. The  reallocation of the cap from Trimester I to Trimester II is limited,  such that the Trimester II cap may only be increased by 50 percent; the  remaining portion of the underage will be reallocated to Trimester III.  Any underages of the cap for Trimester I that are less than 25 percent  of the Trimester I quota will be applied to Trimester III of the same  year. Any overages of the cap for Trimester I and II will be subtracted  from Trimester III of the same year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Performance review. The Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish  Committee shall conduct a detailed review of fishery performance  relative to the butterfish ACL in conjunction with review for the  mackerel fishery, as outlined in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Additional measures. The Monitoring Committee may also provide  recommendations on the following items, if necessary:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Observer provisions to maximize sampling at Sec. 648.11(n)(2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions for the requirement to pump/haul aboard all fish  from net for inspection by at-sea observers in Sec. 648.11(n)(3);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Recommended measures. Based on the review of the data described  in paragraph (b) of this section and requests for research quota as  described in paragraph (g) of this section, the Monitoring Committee  will recommend to the Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish Committee the  measures from the following list that it determines are necessary to  ensure that the specifications are not exceeded:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> RSA set from a range of 0 to 3 percent of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The IOY for longfin squid and/or Illex.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The commercial and/or recreational ACT for mackerel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The ACT for butterfish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Commercial quotas, set after reductions for research quotas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The amount of longfin squid, Illex, and butterfish that may be  retained and landed by vessels issued the incidental catch permit  specified in Sec. 648.4(1)(5)(ii), and the amount of mackerel that may  be retained, possessed and landed by any of the limited access mackerel  permits described at Sec. 648.4(1)(5)(iii) and the incidental mackerel  permit at Sec. 648.4(1)(5)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Commercial minimum fish sizes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Commercial trip limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Commercial seasonal quotas/closures for longfin squid and Illex,  and allocation for the Limited Access Mackerel Tier 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Minimum mesh sizes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Commercial gear restrictions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Recreational allocation for mackerel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Recreational minimum fish size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Recreational possession limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Recreational season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Changes, as appropriate, to the SBRM, including the coefficient  of variation (CV) based performance standard, the means by which discard  data are collected/obtained, fishery stratification, the process for  prioritizing observer sea-day allocations, reports, and/or industry- funded observers or observer set aside programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Modification of existing accountability measures (AMs) utilized  by the Monitoring Committee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Annual fishing measures. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish  Committee will review the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee.  Based on these recommendations and any public comment received thereon,  the Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish Committee must recommend to the  MAFMC appropriate specifications and any measures necessary to assure  that the specifications will not be exceeded. The MAFMC will review  these recommendations and, based on the recommendations and any public  comment received thereon, must recommend to the Regional Administrator  appropriate specifications and any measures necessary to assure that the  ACL will not be exceeded. The MAFMC's recommendations must include  supporting documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental,  economic, and social impacts of the recommendations. The Regional   Administrator will review the recommendations and will publish a  proposed rule in the Federal Register proposing specifications and any  measures necessary to assure that the specifications will not be  exceeded and providing a 30-day public comment period. If the proposed  specifications differ from those recommended by the MAFMC, the reasons  for any differences must be clearly stated and the revised  specifications must satisfy the criteria set forth in this section. The  MAFMC's recommendations will be available for inspection at the office  of the Regional Administrator during the public comment period. If the  annual specifications for squid, mackerel, and butterfish are not  published in the Federal Register prior to the start of the fishing  year, the previous year's annual specifications, excluding  specifications of TALFF, will remain in effect. The previous year's  specifications will be superceded as of the effective date of the final  rule implementing the current year's annual specifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Regional Administrator will make a final determination  concerning the specifications for each species and any measures  necessary to assure that the specifications will not be exceeded. After  the Regional Administrator considers all relevant data and any public  comments, notification of the final specifications and any measures  necessary to assure that the specifications will not be exceeded and  responses to the public comments will be published in the Federal  Register. If the final specification amounts differ from those  recommended by the MAFMC, the reason(s) for the difference(s) must be  clearly stated and the revised specifications must be consistent with  the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Inseason adjustments. The specifications established pursuant to  this section may be adjusted by the Regional Administrator, in  consultation with the MAFMC, during the fishing year by publishing  notification in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Distribution of annual longfin squid commercial quota. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A  commercial quota for longfin squid will be allocated annually into  trimester periods, based on the following percentages: Trimester I  (January-April)--43.0 percent; Trimester II (May-August)--17.0 percent;  and Trimester III (September-December)--40.0 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any underages of commercial period quota for Trimester I that  are greater than 25 percent of the Trimester I quota will be reallocated  to Trimesters II and III of the same year. The reallocation of quota  from Trimester I to Trimester II is limited, such that the Trimester II  quota may only be increased by 50 percent; the remaining portion of the  underage will be reallocated to Trimester III. Any underages of  commercial period quota for Trimester I that are less than 25 percent of  the Trimester I quota will be applied to Trimester III of the same year.  Any overages of commercial quota for Trimesters I and II will be  subtracted from Trimester III of the same year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Research set-aside (RSA) quota. Prior to the MAFMC's quota- setting meetings:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> NMFS will publish a Request for Proposals (RFP) in the Federal  Register, consistent with procedures and requirements established by the  NOAA Grants Office, to solicit proposals from industry for the upcoming  fishing year, based on research priorities identified by the MAFMC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> NMFS will convene a review panel, including the MAFMC's  Comprehensive Management Committee and technical experts, to review  proposals submitted in response to the RFP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each panel member will recommend which research proposals should  be authorized to utilize research quota, based on the selection criteria  described in the RFP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The NEFSC Director and the NOAA Grants Office will consider  each panel member's recommendation, and provide final approval of the  projects. The Regional Administrator may, when appropriate, exempt  selected vessel(s) from regulations specified in each of the respective  FMPs through written notification to the project proponent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The grant awards approved under the RFPs will be for the  upcoming fishing year. Proposals to fund research that would start prior  to, or that would   end after the fishing year, will not be eligible for consideration. All  research and/or compensation trips must be completed within the fishing  year for which the research grant was awarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Research projects will be conducted in accordance with  provisions approved and provided in an Exempted Fishing Permit (EFP)  issued by the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If a proposal is disapproved by the NEFSC Director or the NOAA  Grants Office, or if the Regional Administrator determines that the  allocated research quota cannot be utilized by a project, the Regional  Administrator shall reallocate the unallocated or unused amount of  research quota to the respective commercial and recreational fisheries  by publication of a notice in the Federal Register in compliance with  the Administrative Procedure Act, provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The reallocation of the unallocated or unused amount of research  quota is in accord with National Standard 1, and can be available for  harvest before the end of the fishing year for which the research quota  is specified; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any reallocation of unallocated or unused research quota shall  be consistent with the proportional division of quota between the  commercial and recreational fisheries in the relevant FMP and allocated  to the remaining quota periods for the fishing year proportionally.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Vessels participating in approved research projects may be  exempted from certain management measures by the Regional Administrator,  provided that one of the following analyses of the impacts associated  with the exemptions is provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The analysis of the impacts of the requested exemptions is  included as part of the annual quota specification packages submitted by  the MAFMC; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For proposals that require exemptions that extend beyond the  scope of the analysis provided by the MAFMC, applicants may be required  to provide additional analysis of impacts of the exemptions before  issuance of an EFP will be considered, as specified in the EFP  regulations at Sec. 648.12(b).
