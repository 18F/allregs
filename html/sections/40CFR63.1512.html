(1) The owner or operator of a group 1 furnace that processes scrap other than clean charge materials with emissions controlled by a lime-injected fabric filter must conduct performance tests to measure emissions of PM and D/F at the outlet of the control device and emissions of HCl at the outlet (for the emission limit) or the inlet and the outlet (for the percent reduction standard).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator of a group 1 furnace that processes only clean charge materials with emissions controlled by a lime-injected fabric filter must conduct performance tests to measure emissions of PM at the outlet of the control device and emissions of HCl at the outlet (for the emission limit) or the inlet and the outlet (for the percent reduction standard).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator may choose to determine the rate of reactive flux addition to the group 1 furnace and assume, for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with the SAPU emission limit, that all reactive flux added to the group 1 furnace is emitted. Under these circumstances, the owner or operator is not required to conduct an emission test for HCl.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator of a sidewell group 1 furnace that conducts reactive fluxing (except for cover flux) in the hearth, or that conducts reactive fluxing in the sidewell at times when the level of molten metal falls below the top of the passage between the sidewell and the hearth, must conduct the performance tests required by paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, to measure emissions from both the sidewell and the hearth.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Group 1 furnace (including melting holding furnaces) without add-on air pollution control devices. In the site-specific monitoring plan required by Sec. 63.1510(o), the owner or operator of a group 1 furnace (including a melting/holding furnaces) without add-on air pollution control devices must include data and information demonstrating compliance with the applicable emission limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the group 1 furnace processes other than clean charge material, the owner or operator must conduct emission tests to measure emissions of PM, HCl, and D/F at the furnace exhaust outlet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the group 1 furnace processes only clean charge, the owner or operator must conduct emission tests to simultaneously measure emissions of PM and HCl at the furnace exhaust outlet. A D/F test is not required. Each test must be conducted while the group 1

furnace (including a melting/holding furnace) processes only clean charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator may choose to determine the rate of reactive flux addition to the group 1 furnace and assume, for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with the SAPU emission limit, that all reactive flux added to the group 1 furnace is emitted. Under these circumstances, the owner or operator is not required to conduct an emission test for HCl.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Sweat furnace. Except as provided in Sec. 63.1505(f)(1), the owner or operator must measure emissions of D/F from each sweat furnace at the outlet of the control device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Dross-only furnace.

Under these circumstances, the owner or operator is not required to conduct an emission test for HCl. If the owner or operator of any in-line flux box which has no ventilation ductwork manifolded to any outlet or emission control device chooses to demonstrate compliance with the emission limit for HCl by limiting use of reactive chlorine flux and assuming that all chlorine in the flux is emitted as HCl, compliance with the HCl limit shall also constitute compliance with the emission limit for PM, and no separate emission test for PM is required. In this case, the owner or operator of the unvented in-line flux box must utilize the maximum permissible PM emission rate for the in-line flux boxes when determining the total emissions for any SAPU which includes the flux box.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rotary dross cooler. The owner or operator must conduct a performance test to measure PM emissions at the outlet of the control device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Secondary aluminum processing unit. The owner or operator must conduct performance tests as described in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section. The results of the performance tests are used to establish emission rates in lb/ton of feed/charge for PM and HCl and [micro]g TEQ/Mg of feed/charge for D/F emissions from each emission unit. These emission rates are used for compliance monitoring in the calculation of the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average emission rates using the equation in Sec. 63.1510(t). A performance test is required for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each group 1 furnace processing only clean charge to measure emissions of PM and either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Emissions of HCl (for the emission limit); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The mass flow rate of HCl at the inlet to and outlet from the control device (for the percent reduction standard).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each group 1 furnace that processes scrap other than clean charge to measure emissions of PM and D/F and either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Emissions of HCl (for the emission limit); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The mass flow rate of HCl at the inlet to and outlet from the control device (for the percent reduction standard).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each in-line fluxer to measure emissions of PM and HCl.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Feed/charge weight measurement. During the emission test(s) conducted to determine compliance with emission limits in a kg/Mg (lb/ton) format, the owner or operator of an affected source or emission unit, subject to an emission limit in a kg/Mg (lb/ton) of feed/charge format, must measure (or otherwise determine) and record the total weight of feed/charge to the affected source or emission unit for each of the three test runs and calculate and record the total weight. An owner or operator that chooses to demonstrate

compliance on the basis of the aluminum production weight must measure the weight of aluminum produced by the emission unit or affected source instead of the feed/charge weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Continuous opacity monitoring system. The owner or operator of an affected source or emission unit using a continuous opacity monitoring system must conduct a performance evaluation to demonstrate compliance with Performance Specification 1 in appendix B to 40 CFR part 60.

The owner or operator must use these procedures to establish an operating parameter value or range for the total reactive chlorine flux injection rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Continuously measure and record the weight of gaseous or liquid reactive flux injected for each 15 minute period during the HCl and D/F tests, determine and record the 15-minute block average weights, and calculate and record the total weight of the gaseous or liquid reactive flux for the 3 test runs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Record the identity, composition, and total weight of each addition of solid reactive flux for the 3 test runs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determine the total reactive chlorine flux injection rate by adding the recorded measurement of the total weight of chlorine in the gaseous or liquid reactive flux injected and the total weight of chlorine in the solid reactive flux using Equation 5:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23MR00.013
Where,
Wt = Total chlorine usage, by weight;F1 = Fraction of gaseous or liquid flux that is chlorine;W1 = Weight of reactive flux gas injected;F2 = Fraction of solid reactive chloride flux that is</p><p class="depth0">chlorine (e.g., F = 0.75 for magnesium chloride; andW2 = Weight of solid reactive flux;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Divide the weight of total chlorine usage (Wt) for the 3 test runs by the recorded measurement of the total weight of feed for the 3 test runs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If a solid reactive flux other than magnesium chloride is used, the owner or operator must derive the appropriate proportion factor subject to approval by the applicable permitting authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Lime injection.
