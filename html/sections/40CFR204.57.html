Sec. 204.57-2  Test compressor sample selection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Compressors comprising the batch sample which are required to be tested pursuant to a test request in accordance with this subpart will be randomly selected from a batch of compressors of the category or configuration specified in the test request. The random selection will be achieved by sequentially numbering all of the compressors in the batch and then using a table of random numbers to select the number of compressors, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, based on the batch size designated by the Administrator in the test request. An alternative selection plan may be used by a manufacturer: Provided, That such a plan is approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Acceptable Quality Level is 10 percent. The appropriate sampling plans associated with the designated AQL are contained in Appendix I, Table II.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The appropriate batch sample size will be determined by reference to Appendix I, Tables I and II. A code letter is obtained from Table I based on the batch size designated by the Administrator in a test request. The batch sample size will be equal to the maximum cumulative sample size as listed in Table II for the appropriate code letter obtained from Table I plus an additional ten percent rounded off to the next highest number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Individual compressors comprising the test sample will be randomly selected from the batch sample using the same random selection plan as in paragraph (a) of this section. Test sample size will be determined by entering Table II.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The test compressor of the category or configuration selected for testing shall have been assembled by the manufacturer for distribution in commerce using the manufacturers normal production process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Unless otherwise indicated in the test request, the manufacturer will select the batch sample from the production batch next scheduled after receipt of the test request of the category or configuration specified in the test request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Unless otherwise indicated in the test request, the manufacturer shall select the compressors designated in the test request for testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> At their discretion, EPA Enforcement Officers, rather than the manufacturer, may select the compressors designated in the test request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer will keep on hand all compressors in the batch sample until such time as the batch is accepted or rejected in accordance with Sec. 204.57-6; Except, that compressors actually tested and found to be in conformance with these regulations need not be kept.


Sec. 204.57-3  Test compressor preparation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Prior to the official test, the test compressor selected in accordance with Sec. 204.57-2 shall not be prepared, tested, modified, adjusted, or maintained in any manner unless such adjustments, preparations, modifications and/or tests are part of the manufacturer's prescribed manufacturing and inspection procedures and are documented in the manufacturer's internal compressor assembly and inspection procedures or unless such adjustments and/or tests are required or permitted under this subpart or are approved in advance by the Administrator. The manufacturer may perform adjustments, preparations, modifications and/or tests normally performed by a dealer to prepare the compressor for delivery to a customer or the adjustments, preparations, modifications and/or tests normally performed at the port-of-entry by the manufacturer to prepare the compressor for delivery to a dealer or customer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Equipment of fixtures necessary to conduct the test may be installed on the compressor: Provided, That such equipment of fixtures shall have no effect on the noise emissions of the compressor, as determined by the appropriate measurement methodology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In the event of compressor manfunction (i.e., failure to start, misfiring cylinder, etc.), the manufacturer may perform the maintenance necessary to enable the compressor to operate in a normal manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> No quality control, testing, assembly, or selection procedures shall be used on the completed test compressor or any portion thereof, including parts and subassemblies, that will not normally be used during the production and assembly of all other compressors of that category which will be distributed in commerce, unless such procedures are required or permitted under this subpart or are approved in advance by the Administrator.
