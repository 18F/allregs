A recognized accreditation body must notify FDA electronically, in English, at least 60 days before voluntarily relinquishing recognition or before allowing recognition to expire without seeking renewal. The recognized accreditation body must provide the name and contact information of the custodian who will maintain the records required under Sec.  1.625(a) after the date of relinquishment or the date recognition expires, as applicable, and make them available to FDA as required by Sec.  1.625(b).

offered or in determining the importer's eligibility for participation in VQIP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Public notice of voluntary relinquishment or expiration of recognition.
