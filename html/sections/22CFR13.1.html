                            <p class="depth0">Any consular officer who collects, or knowingly allows to be  collected, for any services any other or greater fees than are allowed  by law for such services, shall, besides his or her liability to refund  the same, be liable to pay to the person by whom or in whose behalf the  same are paid, treble the amount of the unlawful charge so collected, as  a penalty. The refund and penalty may be recovered with costs, in any  proper form of action, by such person for his or her own use. The amount  of such overcharge and penalty may at the discretion of the Secretary of  the Treasury be ordered withheld from the compensation of such officer  for payment to the person entitled to the same (22 U.S.C. 4209).</p><p class="depth0">Note: The foregoing relates to improper collection and personal  withholding of funds by consular officers. For procedure where a  collection, having been erroneously made, has been returned by the  officer to the Treasury in good faith, making a subsequent accounting  adjustment necessary, see Sec. 22.6, Refund of fees of this chapter.
