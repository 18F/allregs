These performance specifications apply to  carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (O2) continuous emission  monitoring systems (CEMSs) installed on incinerators, boilers, and  industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste. The specifications include  procedures which are intended to be used to evaluate the acceptability  of the CEMS at the time of its installation or whenever specified in  regulations or permits. The procedures are not designed to evaluate CEMS  performance over an extended period of time. The source owner or  operator is responsible for the proper calibration, maintenance, and  operation of the CEMS at all times.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.1.2 Principle. Installation and measurement location  specifications, performance and equipment specifications, test and data  reduction procedures, and brief quality assurance guidelines are  included in the specifications. Calibration drift, relative accuracy,  calibration error, and response time tests are conducted to determine  conformance of the CEMS with the specifications.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2.1 Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS). A continuous  monitor is one in which the sample to be analyzed passes the measurement  section of the analyzer without interruption, and which evaluates the  detector response to the sample at least once each 15 seconds and  computes and records the results at least every 60 seconds. A CEMS  consists of all the equipment used to acquire data and includes the  sample extraction and transport hardware, the analyzer(s), and the data  recording/processing hardware and software.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2.2 Monitoring System Types. The specifications require CEMSs  capable of accepting calibration gases. Alternative system designs may  be used if approved by the Regional Administrator. There are two basic  types of monitoring systems: extractive and in-situ.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2.2.1 Extractive.

Systems that perform an analysis without removing  a sample from the stack. Point in-situ analyzers place the sensing or  detecting element directly in the flue gas stream. Cross-stack in-situ  analyzers measure the parameter of interest by placing a source beam on  one side of the stack and the detector (in single-pass instruments) or a  retroreflector (in double-pass instruments) on the other side, and  measuring the parameter of interest (e.g., CO) by the attenuation of the  beam by the gas in its path.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2.3 Instrument Measurement Range.

The time interval between the start of a step  change in the system input (e.g., change of calibration gas) and the  time when the data recorder displays 95 percent of the final value.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2.7 Accuracy. A measure of agreement between a measured value  and an accepted or true value, expressed as the percentage difference  between the true and measured values relative to the true value. For  these performance specifications, accuracy is checked by conducting a  calibration error (CE) test and a relative accuracy (RA) test. Certain  facilities, such as those using solid waste or batch-fed processes, may  observe long periods of almost no CO emissions with brief, high-level CO  emission spikes. These facilities, as well as facilities whose CO  emissions   never exceed 5-10 ppm, may need to be exempted from the RA requirement  because the RA test procedure cannot ensure acquisition of meaningful  test results under these conditions. An alternative procedure for  accuracy determination is described in section 2.1.9.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2.8 Calibration Error (CE).

The CEMS shall  be installed in a location in which measurements representative of the  source's emissions can be obtained. The optimum location of the sample  interface for the CEMS is determined by a number of factors, including  ease of access for calibration and maintenance, the degree to which  sample conditioning will be required, the degree to which it represents  total emissions, and the degree to which it represents the combustion  situation in the firebox. The location should be as free from in-leakage  influences as possible and reasonably free from severe flow  disturbances. The sample location should be at least two equivalent duct  diameters downstream from the nearest control device, point of pollutant  generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant  concentration or emission rate occurs and at least 0.5 diameter upstream  from the exhaust or control device. The equivalent duct diameter is  calculated as per 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method 1, section 2.1. If  these criteria are not achievable or if the location is otherwise less  than optimum, the possibility of stratification should be checked as  described in Section 2.1.3.3 to determine whether the location would  cause failure of the relative accuracy test.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3.1.1 For extractive or point in-situ CEMSs, the measurement  point should be within or centrally located over the centroidal area of  the stack or duct cross section.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3.1.2 For cross-stack CEMSs, the effective measurement path  should (1) have at least 70 percent of the path within the inner 50  percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area or (2) be centrally  located over any part of the centroidal area.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3.1.3 Both the CO and O2 monitors should be installed  at the same general location. If this is not possible, they may be  installed at different locations if the effluent gases at both sample  locations are not stratified and there is no in-leakage of air between  sampling locations.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3.2 Performance Test Method (PTM) Measurement Location and  Traverse Points.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3.2.1 Select an accessible PTM measurement point at least two  equivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, the  point of CO generation, or other point at which a change in the CO  concentration may occur, and at least a half equivalent diameter  upstream from the effluent exhaust or control device. When pollutant  concentration changes are due solely to diluent leakage (e.g., air  heater leakages) and CO and O2 are simultaneously measured at  the same location, one half diameter may be used in place of two  equivalent diameters. The CEMS and PTM locations need not be the same.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3.2.2 Select traverse points that ensure acquisition of  representative samples over the stack or duct cross section. At a  minimum, establish a measurement line that passes through the centroidal  area in the direction of any expected stratification. If this line  interferes with the CEMS measurements, displace the line up to 30 cm (or  5 percent of the equivalent diameter of the cross section, whichever is  less) from the centroidal area. Locate three traverse points at 17, 50,  and 83 percent of the measurement line. If the measurement line is no  longer than 2.4 meters and pollutant stratification is not expected, the  tester may choose to locate the three traverse points on the line at  0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the stack or duct wall. This option must  not be used at a site located within eight equivalent diameters  downstream of a flow disturbance. The tester may select other traverse  points, provided that they can be shown to the satisfaction of the  Administrator to provide a representative sample over the stack or duct  cross-section. Conduct all necessary PTM tests within   3 cm of the selected traverse points. Sampling must not be performed  within 3 cm of the duct or stack inner wall.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3.3 Stratification Test Procedure. Stratification is defined as  a difference in excess of 10 percent between the average concentration  in the duct or stack and the concentration at any point more than 1.0  meter from the duct or stack wall. To determine whether effluent  stratification exists, a dual probe system should be used to determine  the average effluent concentration while measurements at each traverse  point are being made. One probe, located at the stack or duct centroid,  is used as a stationary reference point to indicate the change in  effluent concentration over time. The second probe is used for sampling  at the traverse points specified in method 1, appendix A, 40 CFR part  60. The monitoring system samples sequentially at the reference and  traverse points throughout the testing period for five minutes at each  point.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.4 CEMS Performance and Equipment Specifications</p><p class="depth0">Table 2.1-1 summarizes the performance specifications for the CEMSs.  Two sets of standards for CO are given; one for low-range and another  for high-range measurements. The high-range specifications relate to  measurement and quantification of short duration high concentration  peaks, while the low-range specifications relate to the overall average  operating condition of the burning device. The dual-range specifications  can be met by using (1) one analyzer for each range, (2) a dual range  unit, or (3) a single measurement range instrument capable of meeting  both specifications with a single unit.

These performance specifications apply to  hydrocarbon (HC) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMSs)  installed on incinerators, boilers, and industrial furnaces burning  hazardous waste. The specifications include procedures which are  intended to be used to evaluate the acceptability of the CEMS at the  time of its installation or whenever specified in regulations or  permits. The procedures are not designed to evaluate CEMS performance  over an extended period of time. The source owner or operator is  responsible for the proper calibration, maintenance, and operation of  the CEMS at all times.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.1.2 Principle. A gas sample is extracted from the source through  a heated sample line and heated filter (except as provided by section  2.2.10) to a flame ionization   detector (FID). Results are reported as volume concentration equivalents  of propane. Installation and measurement location specifications,  performance and equipment specifications, test and data reduction  procedures, and brief quality assurance guidelines are included in the  specifications. Calibration drift, calibration error, and response time  tests are conducted to determine conformance of the CEMS with the  specifications.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2.1 Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS).

That portion of the system that is used  for one or more of the following: Sample acquisition, sample  transportation, sample conditioning, or protection of the analyzer from  the effects of the stack effluent.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2.1.2 Organic Analyzer. That portion of the system that senses  organic concentration and generates an output proportional to the gas  concentration.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2.1.3 Data Recorder. That portion of the system that records a  permanent record of the measurement values. The data recorder may  include automatic data reduction capabilities.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2.2 Instrument Measurement Range. The difference between the  minimum and maximum concentration that can be measured by a specific  instrument. The minimum is often stated or assumed to be zero and the  range expressed only as the maximum.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2.3 Span or Span Value. Full scale instrument measurement range.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2.4 Calibration Gas.

A measurement of agreement between a measured  value and an accepted or true value, expressed as the percentage  difference between the true and measured values relative to the true  value. For these performance specifications, accuracy is checked by  conducting a calibration error (CE) test.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2.8 Calibration Error (CE). The difference between the  concentration indicated by the CEMS and the known concentration of the  cylinder gas. A CE test procedure is performed to document the accuracy  and linearity of the monitoring equipment over the entire measurement  range.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2.9 Performance Specification Test (PST) Period. The period  during which CD, CE, and response time tests are conducted.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2.10 Centroidal Area. A concentric area that is geometrically  similar to the stack or duct cross section and is no greater than 1  percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.3 Installation and Measurement Location Specifications</p><p class="depth0">2.2.3.1 CEMS Installation and Measurement Locations. The CEMS shall  be installed in a location in which measurements representative of the  source's emissions can be obtained. The optimum location of the sample  interface for the CEMS is determined by a number of factors, including  ease of access for calibration and maintenance, the degree to which  sample conditioning will be required, the degree to which it represents  total emissions, and the degree to which it represents the combustion  situation in the firebox. The location should be as free from in-leakage  influences as possible and reasonably free from severe flow  disturbances. The sample location should be at least two equivalent duct  diameters downstream from the nearest control device, point of pollutant  generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant  concentration or emission rate occurs and at least 0.5 diameter upstream  from the exhaust or control device. The equivalent duct diameter is  calculated as per 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method 1, section 2.1. If  these criteria are not achievable or if the location is otherwise less  than optimum, the possibility of stratification should be investigated  as described in section 2.2.3.2. The measurement point shall be within  the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.3.2 Stratification Test Procedure. Stratification is defined as  a difference in excess of 10 percent between the average concentration  in the duct or stack and the concentration at any point more than 1.0  meter from the duct or stack wall. To determine whether effluent  stratification exists, a dual probe system should be used to determine  the average effluent concentration while measurements at each traverse  point are being made. One probe, located at the stack or duct centroid,  is used as a stationary reference point to indicate the change in  effluent concentration over time. The second probe is used for sampling  at the traverse points specified in 40 CFR part 60 appendix A, method 1.  The monitoring system samples sequentially at the reference and traverse   points throughout the testing period for five minutes at each point.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.4 CEMS Performance and Equipment Specifications</p><p class="depth0">If this method is applied in highly explosive areas, caution and  care shall be exercised in choice of equipment and installation.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.4.1 Flame Ionization Detector (FID) Analyzer.

The procedure is based on extensive short-term  modeling of 11 generic source types and on a set of adjustment factors  for estimating annual average concentrations from short-term  concentrations. Facility impacts may be determined based on the selected  worst-case stack or on multiple stacks, in which the impacts from each  stack are estimated separately and then added to produce the total  facility impact.</p><p class="depth0">This procedure is most useful for facilities with multiple stacks,  large source-to-property boundary distances, and complex terrain between  1 and 5 km from the facility. To ensure a sufficient degree of  conservatism, the HWCAQSP may not be used if any of the five screening  procedure limitations listed below are true:</p><p class="depth0">The facility is located in a narrow valley less  than 1 km wide;</p><p class="depth0">The facility has a stack taller than 20 m and is  located such that the terrain rises to the stack height within 1 km of  the facility;</p><p class="depth0">The facility has a stack taller than 20 m and is  located within 5 km of the shoreline of a large body of water;</p><p class="depth0">The facility property line is within 200 m of the  stack and the physical stack height is less than 10 m; or</p><p class="depth0">On-site receptors are of concern, and stack  height is less than 10 m.</p><p class="depth0">If any of these criteria are met or the Director determines that  this procedure is not appropriate, then detailed site-specific modeling  or modeling using the ``Screening Procedures for Estimating the Air  Quality Impact of Stationary Sources,'' EPA -450/4-88-010, Office of Air  Quality Planning and Standards, August 1988, is required.

If the screen shows that  emissions from the site are adequately protective, then the need to  collect site-specific meteorological data can be eliminated.</p><p class="depth0">The screening procedure is generally most helpful for facilities  meeting one or more of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0">Multiple stacks with substantially different  release specifications (e.g., stack heights differ by 50  percent, exit temperatures differ by 50 [deg]K, or the exit  flow rates differ by more than a factor of 2),</p><p class="depth0">Terrain located between 1 km and 5 km from the  site increases in elevation by more than the physical height of the  shortest stack (i.e., the facility is located in complex terrain), or</p><p class="depth0">Significant distance between the facility's  stacks and the site boundary [guidance on determining whether a distance  is ``significant'' is provided in Step 6(B) of the procedure].</p><p class="depth0">Steps 1 through 9 of the screening procedure present a simplified  method for determining emissions based on the use of the ``worst-case''  stack. If the simplified method shows that desired feed rates result in  emissions that exceed allowable limits for one or more pollutants, a  refined analysis to examine the emissions from each stack can be  conducted. This multiple-stack method is presented in Step 10.</p><p class="depth0">The steps involved in screening methodology are as follows:  Step 1. Define Source Characteristics   Step 2.

The effective stack height is the physical height of the stack  plus plume rise. As specified in Step 4, the stack height used to  estimate the effective stack height must not exceed GEP requirements.  Plume rise is a function of the stack exit gas temperature and flow  rate.</p><p class="depth0">In this analysis, the effective stack height is used to select the  generic source that represents the dispersion characteristics of the  facility. For facilities located in flat terrain and for all facilities  with worst-case stacks less than or equal to 10 meters in height,  generic source numbers are selected strictly on the basis of effective  stack height. In all other cases, the effective stack height is further  adjusted to take into account the terrain rise near the facility. This  ``terrain-adjusted effective stack height'' (TAESH) is then used to  select the generic source number that represents the dispersion  characteristics of the facility. Follow the steps below to identify the  effective stack height, the TAESH (where applicable), and the  corresponding generic source number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Go to Table 5.0-1 and find the plume rise value corresponding to  the stack temperature and exit flow rate for the worst-case stack  determined in Step 3.

Otherwise, continue to Step  5(E). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ The terrain is considered flat and terrain adjustment factors  are not used if the maximum terrain rise within 5 km of the facility  (see Step 1) is less than 10 percent of the physical stack height of the  worst-case stack. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> For those situations where the conditions in Step 5(D) do not  apply, the effective stack height must be adjusted for terrain. The  TAESH for each distance range is computed by subtracting the terrain  rise within the distance range from the effective stack height. \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ Refer to Step 1 for terrain adjustment data. Note that the  distance from the source to the outer radii of each range is used.

Section 6.0 Simplified Land Use Classification Procedure for Compliance</p><p class="depth0">With Tier I and Tier II Limits</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Introduction</p><p class="depth0">This section provides a simplified procedure to classify areas in  the vicinity of boilers and industrial furnace sites as urban or rural  in order to set risk-based emission limits under subpart H of 40 CFR  part 266. Urban/rural classification is needed because dispersion rates  differ between urban and rural areas and thus, the risk per unit  emission rate differs accordingly. The combination of greater surface  roughness (more buildings/structures to generate turbulent mixing) and  the greater amount of heat released from the surface in an urban area  (generates buoyancy-induced mixing) produces greater rates of  dispersion. The emission limit tables in the regulation, therefore,  distinguish between urban and rural areas.</p><p class="depth0">EPA guidance (EPA 1986) \1\ provides two alternative procedures to  determine whether the character of an area is predominantly urban or  rural. One procedure is based on land use typing and the other is based  on population density. Both procedures require consideration of  characteristics within a 3-km radius from a source, in this case the  facility stack(s). The land use typing method is preferred because it  more directly relates to the surface characteristics that affect  dispersion rates. The remainder of this discussion is, therefore,  focused on the land use method.</p><p class="depth0">While the land use method is more direct, it can also be labor- intensive to apply. For this discussion, the land use method has been  simplified so that it is consistent with EPA guidance (EPA 1986; Auer  1978), while streamlining the process for the majority of applications  so that a clear-cut decision can be made without the need for detailed  analysis. Table 6.0-1 summarizes the simplified approach for classifying  areas as urban or rural. As shown, the applicant always has the option  of applying standard (i.e., more detailed) analyses to more accurately  distinguish between urban and rural areas. However, the procedure  presented here allows for simplified determinations, where appropriate,  to expedite the permitting process.</p><p class="depth0">Table 6.0-1--Classification of Land Use Types ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Urban or rural designation</p><p class="depth0">Type \1\            Description                     \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I1                 Heavy Industrial.......

Within these primary classes, subclasses are identified, as shown in  table 6.0-1. The goal is to estimate the percentage of the area within a  3-km radius that is urban type and the percentage that is rural type.  Industrial and commercial areas are classified as urban; agricultural  areas are classified as rural.</p><p class="depth0">The delineation of urban and rural areas, however, can be more  difficult for the residential type areas shown in table 6.0-1. The  degree of resolution shown in table 6.0-1 for residential areas often  cannot be identified without conducting site area inspections and/or  referring to zoning maps. This process can require extensive analysis,  which, for many applications, can be greatly streamlined without  sacrificing confidence in selecting the appropriate urban or rural  classification.</p><p class="depth0">The fundamental simplifying assumption is based on the premise that  many applications will have clear-cut urban/rural designations, i.e.,  most will be in rural settings that can be definitively characterized  through a brief review of topographical maps. The color coding on USGS  topographical maps provides the most effective means of simplifying the  typing scheme. The suggested typing designations for the color codes  found on topographical maps are as follows: Green Wooded areas (rural). White White areas generally will be treated as rural. This code applies  to areas that are unwooded and do not have densely packed structures  which would require the pink code (house omission tint). Parks,  industrial areas, and unforested rural land will appear as white on the  topographical maps. Of these categories, only the industrial areas could  potentially be classified   as urban based on EPA 1986 or Auer 1978. Industrial areas can be easily  identified in most cases by the characteristics shown in Figure 6.0-1.  For this simplified procedure, white areas that have an industrial  classification will be treated as urban areas.

Concentrations  of toxic constituents in normal residue are determined based on analysis  of a minimum of 10 samples representing a minimum of 10 days of  operation. The statistically-derived concentrations in normal residue  are determined as the upper tolerance limit (95% confidence with a 95%  proportion of the sample distribution) of the normal residue  concentrations. The upper tolerance limit is to be determined as  described in Section 7.2 below. If changes in raw materials or fuels  could lower the statistically-derived concentrations of toxic  constituents of concern, the statistically-derived baseline must be re- established for any such mode of operation with the new raw material or  fuel.</p><p class="depth0">Concentrations of toxic constituents in waste-derived residue are  determined based on the analysis of one or more samples collected over a  compositing period of not more than 24 hours. Multiple samples of the  waste-derived residue may be analyzed or subsamples may be composited  for analysis, provided that the sampling period does not exceed 24  hours. If more than one sample is analyzed to characterize the waste- derived residue generated over a 24-hour period, the arithmetic mean of  the concentrations must be used as the waste-derived concentration for  each constituent.</p><p class="depth0">The concentration of a toxic constituent in the waste-derived  residue is not considered to be significantly higher than in the normal  residue (i.e., the residue passes the Bevill test for that constituent)  if the concentration in the waste-derived residue does not exceed the  statistically-derived concentration.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Calculation of the Upper Tolerance Limit</p><p class="depth0">The 95% confidence with 95% proportion of the sample distribution  (upper tolerance limit) is calculated for a set of values assuming that  the values are normally distributed. The upper tolerance limit is a one- sided calculation and is an appropriate statistical test for cases in  which a single value (the waste-derived residue concentration) is  compared to the distribution of a range of values (the minimum of 10  measurements of normal residue concentrations). The upper tolerance  limit value is determined as follows:  UTL = X + (K)(S)  where  X = mean of the normal residue concentrations, X = X i/n, K = coefficient for sample size n, 95% confidence and 95% proportion, S = standard deviation of the normal residue concentrations, S = ([Sigma](Xi - X)\2\/(n - 1))\0\.\5\, and n = sample size.</p><p class="depth0">The values of K at the 95% confidence and 95% proportion, and sample  size n are given in Table 7.0-1.</p><p class="depth0">For example, a normal residue test results in 10 samples with the  following analytical results for toxic constituent A:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Concentration</p><p class="depth0">Sample No.                         of constituent</p><p class="depth0">A (ppm) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.......................................................              10 2.......................................................              10 3.......................................................              15 4.......................................................              10 5.......................................................               7 6.......................................................              12 7.......................................................              10 8.......................................................              16 9.......................................................              15 10......................................................              10 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">The mean and the standard deviation of these measurements,  calculated using the above equations, are 11.5 and 2.9, respectively.  Assuming that the values are normally distributed, the upper tolerance  limit (UTL) is given by:  UTL=11.5+(2.911)(2.9)=19.9 ppm</p><p class="depth0">Thus, if the concentration of constituent A in the waste-derived  residue is below 19.9 ppm, then the waste-derived residue is eligible  for the Bevill exclusion for constituent A.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Normal Distribution Assumption</p><p class="depth0">As noted in Section 7.2 above, this statistical approach (use of the  upper tolerance limit) for calculation of the concentration in normal  residue is based on the assumption that the concentration data are  distributed normally. The Agency is aware that concentration data of  this type may not always be distributed normally, particularly when  concentrations are near the detection limits. There are a number of  procedures that can be used to test the distribution of a data set. For  example, the Shapiro-Wilk test, examination of a histogram or plot of  the data on normal probability paper, and examination of the coefficient  of skewness are methods that may be applicable, depending on the nature  of the data (References 1 and 2).</p><p class="depth0">If the concentration data are not adequately represented by a normal  distribution, the data may be transformed to attain a near normal  distribution. The Agency has found that concentration data, especially  when near detection levels, often exhibit a lognormal distribution. The  assumption of a lognormal distribution has been used in various programs  at EPA, such as in the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery Land  Disposal Restrictions program for determination of BDAT treatment  standards. The transformed data may be tested for normality using the  procedures identified above. If the transformed data are better  represented by a normal distribution than the untransformed data, the  transformed data should be used in determining the upper tolerance limit  using the procedures in Section 7.2 above.</p><p class="depth0">In all cases where the owner or operator wishes to use other than an  assumption of normally distributed data or believes that use of an  alternate statistical approach is appropriate to the specific data set,  he/she must provide supporting rationale in the operating record that  demonstrates that the data treatment is based upon sound statistical  practice.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 Nondetect Values</p><p class="depth0">The Agency is developing guidance regarding the treatment of  nondetect values (data where the concentration of the constituent being  measured is below the lowest concentration for which the analytical  method is valid) in carrying out the statistical determination described  above. Until the guidance information is available, facilities may  present their own approach to the handling of nondetect data points, but  must provide supporting rationale in the operating record for  consideration by the Director.</p><p class="depth0">Table 7.0-1--K Values for 95% Confidence and 95% Proportion ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Sample size (n)                             K ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 10.........................................................        2.911 11.........................................................        2.815 12.........................................................        2.736 13.........................................................        2.670 14.........................................................        2.614 15.........................................................        2.566 16.........................................................        2.523 17.........................................................        2.486 18.........................................................        2.458 19.........................................................        2.423 20.........................................................        2.396 21.........................................................        2.371 22.........................................................        2.350 23.........................................................        2.329 24.........................................................        2.303 25.........................................................        2.292 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">7.5 References</p><p class="depth0">1.

See  certification of precompliance under 40 CFR 266.103(b). This  documentation also establishes interim status feed rate and operating  limits for the facility. For the initial certification, estimates of  emissions and system removal efficiencies (SREs) can be made to  establish the operating limits. Subsequently, owners or operators must  use emissions testing to demonstrate that emissions do not exceed  allowable levels, and to establish operating limits. See 40 CFR  266.103(c). However, initial estimates of emissions for certification of  precompliance can be based on estimated or established SREs.</p><p class="depth0">The SRE combines the effect of partitioning of the chlorine, metals,  or PM and the air pollution control system removal efficiency (APCS RE)  for these pollutants. The SRE is defined as: SRE=(species input--species emitted) / species input</p><p class="depth0">The SRE can be calculated from the partitioning factor (PF) and APCS  RE by the following formula:  SRE=1--[(PF/l00) X (1--APCS RE/100)]  where:  PF=percentage of the pollutant partitioned to the combustion gas</p><p class="depth0">Estimates of the PF and/or the APCS RE can be based on either EPA's  default values or engineering judgement. EPA's default values for the  APCS RE for metals, HCl, Cl2, and PM are described in this  section. EPA's default values for partitioning of these pollutants are  described in section 9.0.</p><p class="depth0">Guidelines for the use of engineering judgement to estimate APCS REs  or PFs are described in section 9.4.</p><p class="depth0">8.1 APCS RE Default Values for Metals</p><p class="depth0">EPA's default assumptions for APCS RE for metals are shown in Table  8.1-1. The default values in the table are conservative estimates of the  removal efficiencies for metals in BIFs, depending on the volatility of  the metal and the type of APCS.</p><p class="depth0">The volatility of a metal depends on the temperature, the thermal  input, the chlorine   content of the waste, and the identity and concentration of the metal.  Metals that do not vaporize at combustion zone temperatures are  classified as ``nonvolatile''. Such metals typically enter the APCS in  the form of large particles that are removed relatively easily. Metals  that vaporize in the combustion zone and condense before entering the  APCS are classified as ``volatile''. Such metals typically enter the  APCS in the form of very fine, submicron particles that are rather  inefficiently removed in many APCSs. Metals that vaporize in the  combustion zone and do not condense before entering the APCS are  classified as ``very volatile''.

EPA's default assumptions  are discussed below for metals, HCl, Cl2, and PM. The default  assumptions are used to conservatively predict the partitioning factor  for several types of BIFs. Engineering judgement-based partitioning  factor estimates are discussed in section 9.4.</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Partitioning Default Value for Metals</p><p class="depth0">To be conservative, the Agency is assuming that 100 percent of each  metal in each feed stream is partitioned to the combustion gas. Owners/ operators may use this default value or a supportable, site-specific  value developed following the general guidelines provided in section  9.4.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Special Procedures for Chlorine, HCl, and Cl2</p><p class="depth0">The Agency has established the special procedures presented below  for chlorine because the emission limits are based on the pollutants HCl  and Cl2 formed from chlorine fed to the combustor. Therefore,  the owner/operator must estimate the controlled emission rate of both  HCl and Cl2 and show that they do not exceed allowable  levels.</p><p class="depth0">1. The default partitioning value for the fraction of chlorine in  the total feed streams that is partitioned to combustion gas is 100  percent. Owners/operators may use this default value or a supportable,  site-specific value developed following the general guidelines provided  in section 9.4.</p><p class="depth0">2. To determine the partitioning of chlorine in the combustion gas  to HCl versus Cl2, either use the default values below or use  supportable site-specific values developed following the general  guidelines provided in section 9.4.</p><p class="depth0">For BIFs excluding halogen acid furnaces (HAFs),  with a total feed stream chlorine/hydrogen ratio <=0.95, the default  partitioning factor is 20 percent Cl2, 80 percent HCl.</p><p class="depth0">For HAFs and for BIFs with a total feed stream  chlorine/hydrogen ratio 0.95, the default partitioning factor  is 100 percent Cl2.</p><p class="depth0">3. To determine the uncontrolled (i.e., prior to acid gas APCS)  emission rate of HCl and Cl2, multiply the feed rate of  chlorine times the partitioning factor for each pollutant. Then, for  HCl, convert the chlorine emission rate to HCl by multiplying it by the  ratio of the molecular weight of HCl to the molecular weight of Cl  (i.e., 36.5/35.5). No conversion is needed for Cl2.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 Special Procedures for Ash</p><p class="depth0">This section: (1) Explains why ash feed rate limits are not  applicable to cement and light-weight aggregate kilns; (2) presents the  default partitioning values for ash; and (3) explains how to convert the  0.08 gr/dscf, corrected to 7% O2, PM emission limit to a PM  emission rate.</p><p class="depth0">Waiver for Cement and Light-Weight Aggregate Kilns. For cement kilns  and light-weight aggregate kilns, raw material feed streams contain the  vast majority of the ash input, and a significant amount of the ash in  the feed stream is entrained into the kiln exhaust gas. For these  devices, the ash content of the hazardous waste stream is expected to  have a negligible effect on total ash emissions. For this reason, there  is no ash feed rate compliance limit for cement kilns or light-weight  aggregate kilns. Nonetheless, cement kilns and light-weight aggregate  kilns are required to initially certify that PM emissions are not likely  to exceed the PM limit, and subsequently, certify through compliance  testing that the PM limit is not exceeded.</p><p class="depth0">Default Partitioning Value for Ash. The default assumption for  partitioning of ash depends on the feed stream firing system. There are  two methods by which materials may be fired into BIFs: Suspension-firing  and bed-firing.</p><p class="depth0">The suspension category includes atomized and lanced pumpable  liquids and suspension-fired pulverized solids. The default partitioning  assumption for materials fired by these systems is that 100 percent of  the ash partitions to the combustion gas.</p><p class="depth0">The bed-fired category consists principally of stoker boilers and  raw materials (and in some cases containerized hazardous waste) fed into  cement and light-weight aggregate kilns. The default partitioning  assumption for materials fired on a bed is that 5 percent of the ash  partitions to the combustion gas.</p><p class="depth0">Converting the PM Concentration-Based Standard to a PM Mass Emission  Rate. The emission limit for BIFs is 0.08 gr/dscf, corrected to 7%  02, unless a more stringent standard applies [e.g., a New  Source Performance Standard (NSPS) or a State standard implemented under  the State Implementation Plan (SIP)]. To convert the 0.08 gr/dscf  standard to a PM mass emission rate:</p><p class="depth0">1. Determine the flue gas 02 concentration (percent by  volume, dry) and flue gas flow rate (dry standard cubic feet per  minute); and</p><p class="depth0">2. Calculate the allowable PM mass emission rate by multiplying the  concentration- based PM emission standard times the flue gas flow rate  times a dilution correction factor equal to [(21-02  concentration from step 1)/(21-7)].</p><p class="depth0">9.4 Use of Engineering Judgement To Estimate Partitioning and APCS RE</p><p class="depth0">Values</p><p class="depth0">Engineering judgement may be used in place of EPA's conservative  default assumptions to estimate partitioning and APCS RE values provided  that the engineering judgement is defensible and properly documented. To  properly document engineering judgement, the owner/operator must keep a  written record of all assumptions and calculations necessary to justify  the APCS RE used. The owner/operator must provide this record to the  Director upon request and must be prepared to defend the assumptions and  calculations used.</p><p class="depth0">If the engineering judgement is based on emissions testing, the  testing will often document the emission rate of a pollutant relative to  the feed rate of that pollutant rather than the partitioning factor or  APCS RE.</p><p class="depth0">Examples of situations where the use of engineering judgement may be  supportable to estimate a partitioning factor, APCS RE, or SRE include:</p><p class="depth0">Using emissions testing data from the facility to  support an SRE, even though the testing may not meet full QA/QC  procedures (e.g., triplicate test runs). The closer the test results  conform with full QA/QC procedures and the closer the operating  conditions during the test conform with the established operating  conditions for the facility, the more supportable the engineering  judgement will be.</p><p class="depth0">Applying emissions testing data documenting an  SRE for one metal, including nonhazardous surrogate metals to another  less volatile metal.</p><p class="depth0">Applying emissions testing data documenting an  SRE from one facility to a similar facility.</p><p class="depth0">Using APCS vendor guarantees of removal  efficiency.</p><p class="depth0">9.5 Restrictions on Use of Test Data</p><p class="depth0">The measurement of an SRE or an APCS RE may be limited by the  detection limits of the measurement technique. If the emission of a  pollutant is undetectable, then the calculation of SRE or APCS RE should  be based on the lower limit of detectability. An SRE or APCS RE of 100  percent is not acceptable.</p><p class="depth0">Further, mass balance data of facility inputs, emissions, and  products/residues may not be used to support a partitioning factor,  given the inherent uncertainties of such procedures. Partitioning  factors other than the default values may be supported based on  engineering judgement, considering, for example, process chemistry.  Emissions test data may be used to support an engineering judgement- based SRE, which includes both partitioning and APCS RE.</p><p class="depth0">9.5 References  1. Barton, R.G., W.D.

This  approach provides a range of enrichment factors that can be inserted  into a statistical distribution (t-distribution) to determine  EF95 and EF99.  EF95 is the value at which there is a 95% confidence  level that the enrichment factor is below this value at any given time.  Similarly, EF99 is the value at which there is a 99%  confidence level that the enrichment factor is below this value at any  given time.

This ``conservative'' dust metal  concentration limit (DMCLc) is calculated using a ``safe''  enrichment factor (SEF).

If the kiln dust metal concentration at the facility is  just above the ``conservative'' limit based on the ``safe'' enrichment  factor provided in Equation 4b, and the PM emissions are at the PM  emissions limit, there is a 1% chance that the metal emissions are above  the Tier III limit. In either case, the facility would be unacceptably  close to a violation. If this situation occurs more than 5% of the time,  the facility would be required to rerun the series of 10 tests to  determine the enrichment factor.
