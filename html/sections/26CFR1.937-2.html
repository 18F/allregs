                                Sec. 1.937-2  Income from sources within a possession.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. Section 937(b) and this section set forth the rules for determining whether income is considered to be from sources within a particular possession (the relevant possession) for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, including section 957(c) and Subpart D, Part III, Subchapter N, Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, as well as section 7654(a) of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code (until the effective date of its repeal). Paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and

(c)(2) of this section do not apply, however, for purposes of sections 932(a) and (b) and 935(a)(3) (as in effect before the effective date of its repeal). In the case of a possession or territory that administers income tax laws that are identical (except for the substitution of the name of the possession or territory for the term ``United States'' where appropriate) to those in force in the United States, these rules do not apply for purposes of the application of such laws. These rules also do not affect the determination of whether income is considered to be from sources without the United States for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section, the principles of sections 861 through 865 and the regulations under those provisions (relating to the determination of the gross and the taxable income from sources within and without the United States) generally will be applied in determining the gross and the taxable income from sources within and without the relevant possession. In the application of such principles, it generally will be sufficient to substitute, where appropriate, the name of the relevant possession for the term ``United States,'' and to substitute, where appropriate, the term ``bona fide resident of'' followed by the name of the relevant possession for the term ``United States resident.'' Furthermore, the term domestic will be construed to mean created or organized in the relevant possession. In applying these principles, additional substitutions may be necessary to accomplish the intent of section 937(b) and this section. For example, in applying the principles of sections 863(d) and (e) to individuals under this paragraph (b), the term ``bona fide resident of a possession'' will be used instead of the term ``United States person.'' In no case, however, will a bona fide resident or other person have, as a result of the application of these principles, more income from sources within the relevant possession than the amount of income from sources within the United States that a similarly situated U.S. person who is not a bona fide resident would have under sections 861 through 865.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> U.S. income--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, income from sources within the relevant possession will not include any item of income determined under the rules of sections 861 through 865 and the regulations under those provisions to be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, income from sources within the relevant possession will not include any item of income determined under the rules of sections 861 through 865 and the regulations under those provisions to be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> From sources within the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Conduit arrangements. Income will be considered to be from sources within the United States for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section if, pursuant to a plan or arrangement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The income is received in exchange for consideration provided to another person; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such person (or another person) provides the same consideration (or consideration of a like kind) to a third person in exchange for one or more payments constituting income from sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Income from certain sales of inventory property. For special rules that apply to determine the source of income from certain sales of inventory property, see Sec. 1.863-3(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Service in the Armed Forces. In the case of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, the following rules will apply for determining the source of compensation for services performed in compliance with military orders:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the individual is a bona fide resident of a possession and such services are performed in the United States or in another possession, the compensation constitutes income from sources within the possession of which the individual is a bona fide resident (and not from sources within the United States or such other possession).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the individual is not a bona fide resident of a possession and such services are performed in a possession, the compensation constitutes income from sources within the United States (and not from sources within such possession).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Gains from certain dispositions of property--(1) Property of former U.S. residents. (i) Except to the extent an election is made under paragraph (f)(1)(vi) of this section, income from sources within the relevant possession will not include gains from the disposition of property described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section by an individual described in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section. See also section 1277(e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Public Law 99-514 (100 Stat. 2085) (providing that gains from the disposition of certain property by individuals who acquired residency in certain possessions will be considered to be from sources within the United States).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Property of former U.S. residents. (i) Except to the extent an election is made under paragraph (f)(1)(vi) of this section, income from sources within the relevant possession will not include gains from the disposition of property described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section by an individual described in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section. See also section 1277(e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Public Law 99-514 (100 Stat. 2085) (providing that gains from the disposition of certain property by individuals who acquired residency in certain possessions will be considered to be from sources within the United States).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except to the extent an election is made under paragraph (f)(1)(vi) of this section, income from sources within the relevant possession will not include gains from the disposition of property described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section by an individual described in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section.

The election under this paragraph (f)(1)(vi) will be considered made if the individual's income tax return for the year of disposition of the property reports the portion of gain attributable to the taxpayer's possession holding period as determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(vi)(A) or paragraph (f)(1)(vi)(B) of this section, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of marketable securities, the portion of gain attributable to the possession holding period will be determined by reference to the fair market value of the marketable security at the close of the market on the first day of the individual's possession holding period. In the event that the individual is a bona fide resident of the relevant possession for more than a single continuous period, the portion of gain described in this paragraph (f)(1)(vi)(A) will be the aggregate of the portions of gain (or offsetting loss) attributable to each possession holding period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of property other than marketable securities, the portion of gain attributable to the possession holding period in the relevant possession will be determined by multiplying the total gain on disposition of the property by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the possession holding period and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the individual's holding period for the property. For purposes of the preceding sentence, in the event

that the individual is a bona fide resident of the relevant possession for more than a single continuous period, the number of days in the numerator will be the aggregate of the number of days in each possession holding period. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1)(vi)(B), the denominator will include days that are required to be included in an individual's holding period under section 735(b), section 1223, and any other applicable holding period rule in the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(vi) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The term marketable securities means property described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section that is, throughout the individual's holding period, actively traded within the meaning of Sec. 1.1092(d)-1(a); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The term possession holding period means the part of the individual's holding period for the property during which the individual is a bona fide resident of the relevant possession. However, for this purpose, the possession holding period will be considered to commence in all cases on the first day during such period that the individual does not have a tax home outside the relevant possession. In the event that the individual is a bona fide resident of the relevant possession for more than a single continuous period, each possession holding period prior to the one ending on the date of sale or other disposition will be considered to end on the first day that the individual has a tax home outside the relevant possession. With respect to the determination of tax home, see Sec. 1.937-1(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules under section 865 for possessions--(i) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Gain that is considered to be derived from sources outside of the United States under section 865(g)(3) will be considered income from sources within Puerto Rico; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Gain that is considered to be derived from sources outside of the United States under section 865(h)(2)(B) will be considered income from sources within the possession in which the liquidating corporation is created or organized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In applying the principles of section 865 and the regulations under that section pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the rules of section 865(g) will not apply, but the special rule of section 865(h)(2)(B) will apply with respect to gain recognized upon the liquidation of corporations created or organized in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Dividends--(1) Dividends from certain possessions corporations--(i) In general.

X moves to the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI) on March 1, 2009 and changes his principal place of business to NMI on that same date. Assume for purposes of this example that, under Sec. 1.937-1(b) and (f)(1) (year-of-move exception), X is considered a bona fide resident of NMI for 2009 through 2012. On March 1, 2009, the closing value of X's stock in Corporation C, a marketable security (within the meaning of paragraph

However, pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(vi) of this section, X may elect on his 2012 income tax return filed with NMI to treat the portion of this gain attributable to X's possession holding period with respect to NMI as gain from sources within NMI. X's possession holding period with respect to NMI begins on March 1, 2009, the date his tax home changes to the NMI.

Under the principles of section 861(a)(3) as applied pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the compensation that X receives for services performed in the NMI is treated as income from sources within the NMI. Under the principles of section 863(d)(1)(A) as applied pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the compensation that X receives for services performed in international waters is treated as income from sources within the NMI for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (including section 7654, as in effect with respect to the NMI). Thus, all of X's compensation for services during 2008 is treated as income from sources within the NMI.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. X, a U.S. citizen, resides in State L and receives $2,500 of compensation for services performed in Possession J during 2008 for Y, X's employer. X is temporarily present in Possession J in 2008 for a period (or periods) not exceeding a total of 90 days. Y, a U.S. citizen, is not a bona fide resident of Possession J and is not engaged in a trade or business within Possession J. Under the principles of section 861(a)(3) as applied pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the compensation that X receives for services performed in Possession J during 2008 is not treated as income from sources within Possession J.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Company Y, a corporation organized in State C, produces, markets, and distributes music products. Y enters into a recording contract with Z, a recording artist who is a bona fide resident of the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). Pursuant to the contract between Y and Z, Z agrees to perform services as writer, musician, and vocalist on the recording of a new musical composition and related music video. Under the contract, all songs, recordings and related artwork, packaging copy, and liner notes, together with copyrights and other intellectual property in those works, are the sole property of Y, and Z obtains no proprietary rights in that property. As compensation for Z's services, all of which are performed at a recording studio or other locations in the USVI, Y agrees to pay amounts designated as the ``writer's share'' to Z based on a percentage of the music products sold. Y also agrees to make an upfront payment to Z as an advance against future portions of Z's writer's share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent that Z performs personal services within the USVI, the compensation that Z receives for his services is sourced to the USVI under the principles of section 861(a)(3) and Sec. 1.861-4 as applied pursuant to Sec. 1.937-2(b). If all of Z's services are performed in the USVI, none of the writer's share is derived from sources within the United States under section 861(a)(3) and Sec. 1.861-4, nor is it effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States under section 864(c)(3). Accordingly, the U.S. income rule of section 937(b)(2) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section would not operate to prevent Z's services income from being USVI source or USVI effectively connected income within the meaning of section 937(b)(1). If Z also performs services in the United States, however, then the U.S. income rule would apply to the part of Z's compensation that is sourced to the United States under section 861(a)(3) and Sec. 1.861-4. In the event that Y and Z are controlled taxpayers within the meaning of Sec. 1.482-1(i)(5), section 482 and the regulations under that section, including Sec. 1.482-9T(i), would apply to evaluate the arm's length amount charged for Z's controlled services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Effective/applicability dates. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (l), this section applies to income earned in taxable years ending after April 9, 2008. Taxpayers may choose to apply paragraph (b) of this section to income earned in open taxable years ending after October 22, 2004. Taxpayers may choose to apply paragraph (f)(1) of this section to dispositions made after April 11, 2005.
