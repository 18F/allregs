Bonded manufacturers with bonds on Form 2936 executed before September 1, 1973, who desire to file returns under this subpart with benefit of the extended deferral permitted by Sec. 41.114 shall file with the appropriate TTB officer an extension of coverage of bond on Form 2105. Such extension of coverage shall identify the particular bond to which it applies and shall contain a statement of purpose as follows:</p><p class="depth2">To continue in effect said bond (including all extensions or limitations of terms and conditions previously consented to and approved) notwithstanding that the time for payment of the tax may be deferred by the extended deferral period permitted by regulations in 27 CFR 41.114.

If the bond on Form 2986 is in an amount insufficient to cover an extended deferral period, according to the requirements of Sec. 41.121, the bonded manufacturer must either file a new bond or file a strengthening bond to increase the total amount of the bonds then in force to a sufficient amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bonded manufacturers with bonds executed after September 1, 1973. Bonded manufacturers operating under original or superseding bonds executed after September 1, 1973, are automatically qualified for the extended deferral permitted by Sec. 41.114 (unless found in default as provided in Sec. 41.116).

Bonded manufacturers may file returns with benefit of extended deferral only after the applicable bonds and extensions of coverage required by this section have been filed with and approved by the appropriate TTB officer.
