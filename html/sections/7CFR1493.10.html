                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overview. The Export Credit Guarantee (GSM-102) Program of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was developed to expand U.S. Agricultural Commodity exports by making available Payment Guarantees to encourage U.S. private sector financing of foreign purchases of U.S. Agricultural Commodities on credit terms. The Payment Guarantee issued under GSM-102 is an agreement by CCC to pay the Exporter, or the U.S. Financial Institution that may take assignment of the Payment Guarantee, specified amounts of principal and interest in case of default by the Foreign Financial Institution that issued the Letter of Credit for the export sale covered by the Payment Guarantee. Under the GSM-102 program, maximum repayment terms may vary based on risk of default, as determined by CCC. The program operates in a manner intended not to interfere with markets for cash sales and is targeted toward those countries that have sufficient financial strength so that

foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments. In providing this program, CCC seeks to expand and/or maintain market opportunities for U.S. agricultural exporters and assist long-term market development for U.S. Agricultural Commodities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Program administration. The GSM-102 program is administered under the direction of the General Sales Manager and Vice President of CCC, pursuant to this subpart, subpart A, and any Program Announcements issued by CCC. From time to time, CCC may issue a notice to participants on the USDA Web site to remind participants of the requirements of the GSM-102 program or to clarify the program requirements contained in these regulations in a manner not inconsistent with this subpart and subpart A. Program information, such as eligible U.S. Agricultural Commodities and approved U.S. and Foreign Financial Institutions, is available on the USDA Web site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Country and regional program announcements. From time to time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement on the USDA Web site to announce a GSM-102 program for a specific country or region. The Program Announcement for a country or region will designate specific U.S. Agricultural Commodities or products thereof, or designate that all eligible U.S. Agricultural Commodities are available under the announcement. The Program Announcement will contain any requirements applicable to that country or region as determined by CCC.</p>
