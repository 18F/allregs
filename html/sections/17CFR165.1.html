                            <p class="depth0">Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act, entitled ``Commodity  Whistleblower Incentives and Protection,'' requires the Commission to  pay awards, subject to certain limitations and conditions, to  whistleblowers who voluntarily provide the Commission with original  information about violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. This part  165 describes the whistleblower program that the Commission intends to  establish to implement the provisions of Section 23, and explains the  procedures the whistleblower will need to follow in order to be eligible  for an award. Whistleblowers should read these procedures carefully,  because the failure to take certain required steps within the time  frames described in this part may result in disqualification from  receiving an award. Unless expressly provided for in this part, no  person is authorized to make any offer or promise, or otherwise to bind  the Commission with respect to the payment of any award or the amount  thereof.</p>
