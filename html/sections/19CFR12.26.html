Such permits must be obtained before the animals are shipped from the  country of exportation. All wild ruminants and swine must be inspected  at designated ports of entry by veterinarians of the Animal and Plant  Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services, United States Department  of Agriculture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Psittacine birds, which include all birds commonly known as  parrots, Amazons, African grays, cockatoos, macaws, parrotlets, beebees,  parakeets, lovebirds, lories, lorikeets, and all other birds of the  order Psittaciformes, when destined for a zoological park or medical  research institution without having had prior confinement and treatment  abroad at an approved treatment center, and psittacine birds taken out  of the United States but inadmissible under paragraph (c) of this  section, may be imported when accompanied by a permit issued by the  Surgeon General.

All such birds must be inspected at designated ports of  entry by veterinarians of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection  Service, Veterinary Services, United States Department of Agriculture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Psittacine birds as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section,  not to exceed two such birds by members of a family comprising a single  household in any 12-month period, may be imported under prescribed  conditions (see 42 CFR 71.164(e)) without permit and without prior  confinement and treatment, to be kept as pets by the owner, who will be  required to comply with the Foreign Quarantine Regulations of the U.S.  Public Health Service.

No such birds shall be released until the importer has  complied with applicable requirements of the Public Health regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cats, dogs, and monkeys are subject to the Foreign Quarantine  Regulations of the United States Public Health Service, Department of  Health, Education, and Welfare, Washington, D.C.

A stipulation shall be  filed with the port director within 24 hours of the entry to produce the  necessary permit within 30 days from the date of entry, whereupon final  liquidation shall be suspended until the permit is produced or the 30- day period expires. The shipment may be immediately released if a bond  is filed with the port director on Customs Form 301, containing the bond  conditions set forth in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter, in an amount equal  to the entered value plus estimated duties. If the bond conditions are  violated the port director shall issue a claim for liquidated damages  under the bond. In lieu of filing a bond the merchandise may be left in  Customs custody at the risk and expense of the importer pending issuance  of the permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the permit referred to in paragraph (e) of this section is  refused by the Fish and Wildlife Service, or if the permit is not  produced within the said 30 days, the port director shall promptly  recall the property, if delivered under bond, and shall require its  immediate exportation at the expense of the importer or consignee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All import shipments of fish and wildlife subject to the  regulations or permit requirements of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, published pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16  U.S.C. 1531, or other statutory authority, shall be subject to  examination or inspection by that agency's officer serving the port of  entry, for determination as to permissible release or such other  disposition as he may direct. Customs officers performing examinations  of such fish and wildlife in accordance with regulations of the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service in 50 CFR part 10 and parts 13 through 17,  shall release shipments only upon submission by the importer of evidence  sufficient to establish compliance with those regulations, any  applicable permit requirements, and compliance with applicable  identification and package or container marking requirements as  specified by 50 CFR 17.6(a) and 17.9.

No Customs disposition of the  importation shall be concluded pending the determination by the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service of the true nature of the species or  subspecies. In case of refusal or neglect of the importer or consignee,  or agent of either, to have the identity so established, final  disposition of the importation shall be required as determined by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In addition to U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service Form 3-177, required to be filed as prescribed in 50 CFR 17.4  upon entry of importations of fish and wildlife, entrants shall present  appropriate foreign export permits, other acceptable foreign documentary  evidence of lawful taking, transportation, or sale, or appropriate  American consular certificates upon importation of fish   and wildlife species or subspecies subject to such documentation  requirements of 50 CFR 17.4 (c) and (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any antique article imported under Sec. 10.53(g) of this  chapter shall be entered at one of the following ports:  Boston, Massachusetts New York, New York Baltimore, Maryland, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Miami, Florida, San Juan, Puerto Rico New Orleans, Louisiana Houston, Texas Los Angeles, California San Francisco, California Anchorage, Alaska, Honolulu, Hawaii O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> All invoices of animals and birds shall specify the species  covered thereby and the number of each species. In the event of the  return to the port director of any importation under the bond given  under paragraph (e) of this section, if the number and species of birds  does not correspond with the description stated in the invoice and if no  satisfactory explanation of any discrepancy is furnished, a claim for  liquidated damages shall be issued under the bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The privilege of entry for immediate transportation granted by  section 552, Tariff Act of 1930, shall not be allowed for importations  of fish, birds, or other wildlife which are confirmed at the port of  first arrival or discharge to be injurious prohibited species, or which  require permits issued prior to importation, or which are subject to  quarantine regulations or inspection at the ports of first arrival or  discharge or other specified place of veterinary inspection. However,  entry for immediate transportation properly is allowed for any  importation of fish, birds, or other wildlife which at the place of  first arrival or discharge is not confirmed to be an injurious  prohibited specie and which, following compliance with any applicable  quarantine regulations or required veterinary inspection, is being  transported by means of an in-bond movement to a port of entry  designated in 50 CFR part 17, appendix B, for Customs entry (see  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section). Ports of designated entry,  inspection, quarantine, and related enforcement procedures covering  certain animals and poultry and certain animal and poultry products  imported into the United States are regulated by requirements and  standards prescribed in regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture,  Department of Agriculture (see 9 CFR parts 92-96; 19 CFR 12.8 and  12.24).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Wild animals and birds shall be imported under humane and  healthful conditions, due regard being given to the accommodations and  facilities necessary for the species transported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> When any Customs officer has good reason to believe that wild  animals or birds have been imported under inhumane or unhealthful  conditions in violation of 18 U.S.C. 42, an immediate investigation  shall be made to ascertain whether they have in fact been transported  under such conditions. The investigation shall determine the provisions  made on the vessel or other conveyance for the accommodation of the  animals or birds, the suitability of the boxes, cages, stalls, etc., the  space, ventilation, and protection from the elements accorded the  animals or birds, the facilities for cleaning, feeding, watering,  bedding, and such other services as may be required for the species  imported. The investigation shall also determine, the physical condition  of such animals or birds and the ratio of dead, crippled, diseased, or  starving animals or birds. If necessary, officers of the Animal and  Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services, or Fish and  Wildlife Service, or other officers or experts, may be called upon to  assist customs officers in the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Unless the port director is satisfied that the provisions of 18  U.S.C. 42 have not been violated, he shall report the matter to the  United States attorney for appropriate action.
