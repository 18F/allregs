All PHAs must retain supporting documents for any  certifications and for asset management reviews for at least 3 years.  Failure to maintain and provide supporting documentation for a period of  3 years for any indicator(s), subindicator(s), or other methods used to  assess performance shall result in a score of zero for the indicator(s)  or subindicator(s), and a lower overall PHAS score for the applicable  assessment period.</p>
