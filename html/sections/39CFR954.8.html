                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Place of filing. Parties shall file an original and three copies  of all documents of record, unless otherwise ordered by the presiding  officer with the Recorder of the Postal Service, who shall cause copies  to be delivered to the other parties and to the presiding officer.  Service is ordinarily made on the private parties by certified mail and  delivery is deemed complete when a document or notice of its arrival is  left at the designated address. The Recorder shall maintain a docket and  the files in all proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Petition. A publisher may appeal from a ruling of the authorized  official by filing a petition within 15 days of the receipt of the  ruling unless the time is extended by the authorized official. The  petition shall state the reasons why the publisher (designated  ``Petitioner'' in the proceeding) believes the ruling of the authorized  official is erroneous and shall provide the address at which documents  may be served on the Petitioner. The petition shall also allege facts  showing compliance with each provision of law or regulation on which the  publisher's claim to Periodicals mail privileges is based. The publisher  shall attach to his or her petition a copy of the letter of the  authorized official denying, suspending or revoking Periodicals mail  privileges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of hearing. Upon receipt of the petition the Recorder  shall set a date for the hearing and issue a notice of hearing to the  parties stating the time and place of the hearing, the date for filing  an answer, and the name of the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Answer. The authorized official (designated the ``Respondent''  in the proceeding) shall answer the petition within 15 days after filing  and admit or deny each allegation of the petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amendment. An amendment of a pleading may be offered by any  party at any time prior to the close of the hearing. If the presiding  officer deems   it appropriate to permit the amendment of a pleading, he or she may  impose such conditions, by way of continuance of the hearing date or  otherwise, as he or she considers necessary to assure a fair hearing.
