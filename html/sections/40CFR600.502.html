A car line is defined in subpart A (with additional guidance provided in EPA Advisory Circular 89) as a group of vehicles within a make or division which has a degree of commonality in construction. Car line does not consider any level of decor or opulence and is not generally distinguished by such characteristics as roofline, number of doors, seats, or windows. Station wagons and light duty trucks are, however, identified separately from the remainder of each car line. In other words, a Castor station wagon would be considered a different car line than the normal Castor car line made up of sedans, coupes, etc.</p><p class="depth0">B. The engine considered here is defined as a basic engine in subpart A of this part (with additional guidance provided in EPA Advisory Circular 83A). A basic engine is a unique combination of manufacturer, engine displacement, number of cylinders, fuel system, catalyst usage and other engine and emission control system characteristics specified by the Administrator. A model type is a unique combination of car line, basic engine,

and transmission class. Thus Ajax is a car line but Ajax 3.0 liter, 6 cylinder manual four-speed transmission is a model type whereas Ajax 3.0 liter, 6 cylinder automatic three-speed transmission is a different model type.</p><p class="depth0">C.

Determine base level fuel economy values.</p><p class="depth0">A. For all the base levels except the base level which includes 4,000 pound, manual four-speed transmission data, the base level fuel economy is as noted in Step II since only one vehicle configuration was tested within each of these base levels.

Since data from more than one vehicle configuration are included in the 4,000-pound, manual four-speed transmission base level, this fuel economy is harmonically averaged in proportion to the percentage of total sales of all vehicle configurations tested within that base level represented by each vehicle configuration tested within that base level.

Any label markings for which colors are not specified must be in black and white as shown. Some portions of the label must be filled with a blue or blue-shaded color as specified in subpart D of this part. Use the color blue defined in CMYK values of 40c-10m-0y-0k, or it may be specified as Pantone 283.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Use a Univers font from Adobe or another source that properly reproduces the labels as shown in the samples. Use Light (L), Roman (R), Bold (B) or Black (Bl) font weights as noted. Font size is shown in points, followed by leading specifications in points to indicate line spacing (if applicable). Use white characters in black fields; use black characters in all other places. Unless noted otherwise, text is left-justified with a 1.6 millimeter margin. Some type may need tracking adjustments to fit in the designated space.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Use the following conventions for lines and borders:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Narrow lines defining the border or separating the main fields are 1.6 millimeter thick.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each rectangular shape or area, including the overall label outline, has an upper left corner that is square (0 radius). All other corners have a 3.2 millimeter radius.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Fuel and vehicle icons, range and slider bars, and agency names and logos are available electronically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The following figures illustrate the formatting specifications:
