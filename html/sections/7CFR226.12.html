                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Sponsoring organizations for day care homes shall  receive payments for administrative costs. During any fiscal year,  administrative costs payments to a sponsoring organization may not  exceed the lesser of (1) actual expenditures for the costs of  administering the Program less income to the Program, or (2) the amount  of administrative costs approved by the State agency in the sponsoring  organization's budget, or (3) the sum of the products obtained by  multiplying each month the sponsoring organization's:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Initial 50 day care homes by 42 dollars;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Next 150 day care homes by 32 dollars;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Next 800 day care homes by 25 dollars; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Additional day care homes by 22 dollars.      During any fiscal year, administrative payments to a sponsoring  organization may not exceed 30 percent of the total amount of  administrative payments and food service payments for day care home  operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Start-up and expansion payments. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prospective sponsoring  organizations of day care homes, participating sponsoring organizations  of child care centers or outside-school-hours care centers, independent  centers, and participating sponsoring organizations of less than 50  homes which meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall  be entitled to receive start-up payments to develop or expand successful  Program operations in day care homes. Participating sponsoring  organizations of day care homes which meet the criteria in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section shall be entitled to receive expansion payments  to initiate or expand Program operations in day care homes in low-income  or rural areas. The State agency shall approve start-up payments only  once for any eligible sponsoring organization, but may approve expansion  payments for any eligible sponsoring organization more than once,  provided that: the request must be for expansion into an area(s) other  than that specified in their initial or prior request; and 12 months has  elapsed since the sponsoring organization has satisfied all obligations  under its initial or prior expansion agreement. Eligible sponsoring  organizations which have received start-up payments shall be eligible to  apply for expansion payments at a date no earlier than 12 months after  it has satisfied all its obligations under its start-up agreement with  the State agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sponsoring organizations which apply for start-up or expansion  payments shall evidence:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Public status or tax exempt status under the Internal Revenue  Code of 1986;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An organizational history of managing funds and ongoing  activities (i.e., administering public or private programs);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An acceptable and realistic plan for recruiting day care homes  to participate in the Program (such as the method of contacting  providers), which may be based on estimates of the number of day care  homes to be recruited and information supporting their existence, and in  the case of sponsoring organizations applying for expansion payments,  documentation that the day care homes to be recruited are located in  low-income or rural areas; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An acceptable preliminary sponsoring organization management  plan including, but not limited to, plans for preoperational visits and  training.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The State agency shall deny start-up and expansion payments to  applicant sponsoring organizations which fail to meet the criteria of  paragraph (b)(2) of this section or which have not been financially  responsible in the operation of other programs funded by Federal, State,  or local governments. The State agency shall notify the sponsoring  organization of the reasons for denial and allow the sponsoring  organization full opportunity to submit evidence on appeal as provided  for in Sec. 226.6(k). Any sponsoring organization applying for start-up  or expansion funds shall be notified of approval or disapproval by the  State agency in writing within 30 calendar days of filing a complete and  correct application. If a sponsoring organization submits an incomplete  application, the State agency shall notify the sponsoring organization  within 15 calendar days of receipt of the application and shall provide  technical assistance, if necessary, to the sponsoring organization for  the purpose of completing its application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Sponsoring organizations which apply for and meet the criteria  for start-up or expansion payments shall enter into an agreement with  the State agency. The agreement shall specify:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Activities which the sponsoring organization will undertake to  initiate or expand Program operations in day care homes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of start-up or expansion payments to be issued to  the sponsoring organization, together with an administrative budget  detailing the costs which the sponsoring organization shall incur,  document, and claim;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The time allotted to the sponsoring organization for the  initiation or expansion of Program operations in family day care homes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The responsibility of the applicant sponsoring organization to  repay, upon demand by the State agency, start-up or expansion payments  not expended in accordance with the agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Upon execution of the agreement, the State agency shall issue a  start-up or expansion payment to the sponsoring organization in an  amount equal to not less than one, but not more than two month's  anticipated administrative reimbursement to the sponsoring organization  as determined by the State agency. However, no sponsoring organization  may receive start-up or expansion payments for more than 50 day care  homes. Eligible sponsoring organizations with fewer than 50 homes under  their jurisdiction at the time of application for start-up payments may  receive such payments for up to 50 homes, less the number of homes under  their jurisdiction. Eligible sponsoring organizations applying for  expansion funds may receive at a maximum such payments for up to 50  homes at the currently assigned administrative payment for the first 50  homes. In determining the amount of start-up or expansion payments to be  made to a sponsoring organization, the State agency shall consider the  anticipated level of start-up or expansion costs to be incurred by the  sponsoring organization and alternate sources of funds available to the  sponsoring organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Upon expiration of the time allotted to the sponsoring  organization for initiating or expanding Program operations in day care  homes, the State agency shall obtain and review documentation of  activities performed and costs incurred by the sponsoring organization  under the terms of the start-up or expansion agreement. If the  sponsoring organization has not made every reasonable effort to carry  out the activities specified in the agreement, the State agency shall  demand repayment of all or part of the payment. The sponsoring  organization may retain start-up or expansion payments for all day care  homes which initiate Program operations. However, no sponsoring  organization may retain any start-up or expansion payments in excess of  its actual costs for the expenditures specified in the agreement.
