The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) may provide technical assistance, upon request by the producer or landowner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The CCC provides a single contract and annual payments for implementation of innovative and environmentally-sound methods for addressing natural resource concerns for producers of wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice, resulting in consolidation of payments that would have been available under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), the Wetlands Reserve Program cost-share agreements (WRP), and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). CFO participation is determined through two step process: first, the Chief, with FSA concurrence, selects CFO pilot project areas based on proposals submitted by the public; then CCC accepts applications from eligible producers or owners within the selected pilot project area.</p>
