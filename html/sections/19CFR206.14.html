Such petition shall state whether provisional relief is sought  because critical circumstances exist or because the imported article is  a perishable agricultural product. In addition, such petition shall  include the following information, to the extent that such information  is available from governmental or other sources, or best estimates and  the basis therefor if such information is not available:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Product description.

Data on total U.S. production of the  domestic article for each full year for which data are provided pursuant  to paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Data showing injury. Quantitative data indicating the nature and  extent of injury to the domestic industry concerned:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to serious injury, data indicating:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A significant idling of production facilities in the industry,  including data indicating plant closings or the underutilization of  production capacity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The inability of a significant number of firms to carry out  domestic production operations at a reasonable level of profit; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Significant unemployment or underemployment within the  industry; and/or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to the threat of serious injury, data relating to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A decline in sales or market share, a higher and growing  inventory (whether maintained by domestic producers, importers,  wholesalers, or retailers), and a downward trend in production, profits,  wages, productivity, or employment (or increasing underemployment);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The extent to which firms in the industry are unable to  generate adequate capital to finance the modernization of their domestic  plants and equipment, or are unable to maintain existing levels of  expenditures for research and development;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The extent to which the U.S. market is the focal point for the  diversion of exports of the article concerned by reason of restraints on  exports of such article to, or on imports of such article into, third  country markets; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Changes in the level of prices, production, and productivity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Cause of injury. An enumeration and description of the causes  believed to be resulting in the injury, or threat thereof, described  under paragraph (e) of this section, and a statement regarding the  extent to which increased imports, either actual or relative to domestic  production, of the imported article are believed to be such a cause,  supported by pertinent data;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Relief sought and purpose thereof. A statement describing the  import relief sought, including the type, amount, and duration, and the  specific purposes therefor, which may include facilitating the orderly  transfer of resources to more productive pursuits, enhancing  competitiveness, or other means of adjustment to new conditions of  competition;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Efforts to compete.

If the petition alleges the existence of  critical circumstances, a statement setting forth the basis for the  belief that there is clear evidence that increased imports (either  actual or relative to domestic production) of the article are a  substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the  domestic industry, and that delay in taking action would cause damage to  that industry that would be difficult to repair, and a statement  concerning the provisional relief requested and the basis therefor.</p>
