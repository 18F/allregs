                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This subpart establishes policy, procedures,  requirements, and responsibilities for administration of the Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, at the Export-Import Bank of the  United States (Ex-Im Bank).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Policy. It is Ex-Im Bank's policy to honor all requests for the  disclosure of its records, provided that disclosure would not adversely  affect a legitimate public or private interest and would not impose an  unreasonable burden on Ex-Im Bank. However, this subpart also recognizes  that the soundness of many Ex-Im Bank programs depends upon the receipt  of reliable commercial, technical, financial, and business information  relating to applicants for Ex-Im Bank assistance and that receipt of  such information depends on Ex-Im Bank's ability to hold such  information in confidence. Consequently, except as provided by  applicable law and this regulation, information provided to Ex-Im Bank  in confidence will not be disclosed without the submitter's consent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope. All record requests made to Ex-Im Bank shall be processed  under this subpart, except that information customarily furnished to the  public in the regular course of the performance of official duties may  continue to be furnished to the public without complying with this  subpart. Requests made by individuals under the Privacy Act of 1974  which are processed under subpart B of this part also shall be processed  under this subpart A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ex-Im Bank Internet site. Ex-Im Bank maintains an Internet site  at http://www.exim.gov. The site contains information on Ex-Im Bank  functions, activities, programs, and transactions. Web site visitors  have access to Board of Directors and Loan Committee meeting minutes,  country information, and Ex-Im Bank press releases, among other  information. Ex-Im Bank encourages all prospective FOIA requesters to  visit the site prior to submission of a FOIA request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Delegation. Any action or determination in this subpart which is  the responsibility of a specific Ex-Im Bank employee, may be delegated  to a duly designated alternate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Ex-Im Bank address. The Export-Import Bank of the United States  is located at 811 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20571.</p>
