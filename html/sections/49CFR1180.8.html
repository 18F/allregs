                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applications for major transactions must include a full-system operating plan--incorporating any prospective operations in Canada and Mexico--from which they must demonstrate how the proposed transaction would affect operations within regions of the United States and on a nationwide basis. As part of the environmental review process, applicants shall submit:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Safety Integration Plan, prepared in consultation with the Federal Railroad Administration, to ensure that safe operations would be maintained throughout the merger implementation process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information on what measures they plan to take to address potentially blocked crossings as a result of merger-related changes in operations or increases in rail traffic.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For major and significant transactions: Operating plan (exhibit 13). Submit a summary of the proposed operating plan changes, based on the impact analyses, that will result from the transaction, and their anticipated timing, allowing for any time required to complete rehabilitation, upgrading, yard construction, or other major operational changes following consummation of the proposed transaction. The plan should make clear the gains in service, operating efficiencies, and other benefits anticipated from the merger. The plan should include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The patterns of service on the properties, including the proposed principal routes, proposed consolidations of main-line operations, and the anticipated traffic density and general categories of traffic (including numbers of trains) on all main and secondary lines in the system. Identify all yards expected to have an increase in activity greater than 20 percent. Changes in operations may be summarized in a pro forma density chart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If commuter or other passenger services are operated over the lines of applicant carriers, detail any impacts anticipated on such services, including delays which may be occasioned because a line is scheduled to handle increased traffic due to route consolidations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The anticipated equipment requirements of the proposed system, including locomotives, rolling stock by type, and maintenance-of-way equipment; plans for acquisition and retirement of equipment; projected improvements in equipment utilization and their relation to operating changes; and how these will lead to the financial and service benefits described in the summary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the effect of any deferred maintenance or delayed capital improvements on any road or equipment properties involved, the schedule for eliminating such deferrals, details of general system rehabilitation including rehabilitation relating to the transaction (including proposed yard and terminal modifications), and how these activities will lead to the service improvements or operating economies anticipated from the transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Density charts (exhibit 14). Gross ton-mile traffic density charts shall be filed for applicant carriers containing a map geographically showing those lines handling 1 million gross ton-miles per mile road or more per year and respective densities, expressed in gross ton-miles per year, in each direction, in segments of such lines between major freight yards and terminals, including major intramodal and intermodal interchange points, using the corporate or political subdivision name of the points shown as well as the railroad station name. The mileage of each segment of line shall be provided, and should be shown on the chart. Data

shown in the density chart shall be for the latest available full calendar year preceding the filing of the application. At applicants' option data may be shown on the density chart or an explanatory list.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For minor transactions: Operating plan-minor (exhibit 15). Discuss any significant changes in patterns or types of service as reflected by the operating plan expected to be used after consummation of the transaction. Where relevant, submit information related to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Traffic level density on lines proposed for joint operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Impacts on commuter or other passenger service operated over a line which is to be downgraded, eliminated, or operated on a consolidated basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Operating economies, which include, but are not limited to, estimated savings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any anticipated discontinuances or abandonments.
