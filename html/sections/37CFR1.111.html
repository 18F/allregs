See Sec. Sec.  1.135 and 1.136  for time for reply to avoid abandonment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Supplemental replies. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A reply that is supplemental to a  reply that is in compliance with Sec.  1.111(b) will not be entered as a  matter of right except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this  section. The Office may enter a supplemental reply if the supplemental  reply is clearly limited to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Cancellation of a claim(s);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Adoption of the examiner suggestion(s);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Placement of the application in condition for allowance;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Reply to an Office requirement made after the first reply was  filed;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Correction of informalities (e.g., typographical errors); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Simplification of issues for appeal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A supplemental reply will be entered if the supplemental reply  is filed within the period during which action by the Office is  suspended under Sec.  1.103(a) or (c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In order to be entitled to reconsideration or further  examination, the applicant or patent owner must reply to the Office  action. The reply by the applicant or patent owner must be reduced to a  writing which distinctly and specifically points out the supposed errors  in the examiner's action and must reply to every ground of objection and  rejection in the prior Office action. The reply must present arguments  pointing out the specific distinctions believed to render the claims,  including any newly presented claims, patentable over any applied  references. If the reply is with respect to an application, a request  may be made that objections or requirements as to form not necessary to  further consideration of the claims be held in abeyance until allowable  subject matter is indicated. The applicant's or patent owner's reply  must appear throughout to be a bona fide attempt to advance the  application or the reexamination proceeding to final action. A general  allegation that the claims define a patentable invention without  specifically pointing out how the language of the claims patentably   distinguishes them from the references does not comply with the  requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In amending in reply to a rejection of claims in an application  or patent under reexamination, the applicant or patent owner must  clearly point out the patentable novelty which he or she thinks the  claims present in view of the state of the art disclosed by the  references cited or the objections made. The applicant or patent owner  must also show how the amendments avoid such references or objections.
