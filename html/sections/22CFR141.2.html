                            <p class="depth0">This part applies to any program for which Federal financial  assistance, as defined in this part, is authorized under a law  administered by the Department including, but not limited to, the types  of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A of this part. It  applies to Federal financial assistance of any form, including property  which may be acquired as a result of and in connection with such  assistance, extended program after the effective date of this  regulation, even if the application is approved prior to such effective  date. This part does not apply to (a) any Federal financial assistance  by way of insurance of guaranty contracts; (b) money paid, property  transferred, or other assistance extended before the effective date of  this regulation; (c) any assistance to any individual who is the  ultimate beneficiary; or (d) any employment practice, under any such  program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization,  except to the extent described in Sec. 141.3 (d), or (e) any assistance  to an activity carried on outside the United States by a person,  institution, or other entity not located in the United States. The fact  that a type of Federal financial assistance is not listed in appendix A  of this part shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise  applicable, that a program is not covered. Transfers of surplus property  in the United States are subject to regulations issued by the  Administrator of General Services (41 CFR 101-6.2).  [38 FR 17945, July 5, 1973]</p>
