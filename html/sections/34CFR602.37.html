                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The agency may appeal the senior Department official's decision to the Secretary. Such appeal stays the decision of the senior Department official until final disposition of the appeal. If an agency wishes to appeal, the agency must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notify the Secretary and the senior Department official in writing of its intent to appeal the decision of the senior Department official, no later than ten days after receipt of the decision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submit its appeal to the Secretary in writing no later than 30 days after receipt of the decision; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide the senior Department official with a copy of the appeal at the same time it submits the appeal to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The senior Department official may file a written response to the appeal. To do so, the senior Department official must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submit a response to the Secretary no later than 30 days after receipt of a copy of the appeal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide the agency with a copy of the senior Department official's response at the same time it is submitted to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Neither the agency nor the senior Department official may include in its submission any new evidence it did not submit previously in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> On appeal, the Secretary makes a recognition decision, as described in Sec.  602.36(e). If the decision requires a compliance report, the report is due within 30 days after the end of the period specified in the Secretary's decision. The Secretary renders a final decision after taking into account the senior Department official's decision, the agency's written submissions on appeal, the senior Department official's response to the appeal, if any, and the entire record before the senior Department official. The Secretary notifies the agency in writing of the Secretary's decision regarding the agency's recognition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Secretary may determine, based on the record, that a decision to deny, limit, suspend, or terminate an agency's recognition may be warranted based on a finding that the agency is noncompliant with, or ineffective in its application with respect to, a criterion or criteria for recognition not identified as an area of noncompliance earlier in the proceedings. In that case, the Secretary, without further consideration of the appeal, refers the matter to the senior Department official for consideration of the issue under Sec.  602.36(f). After the senior Department official makes a decision, the agency may, if desired, appeal that decision to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If relevant and material information pertaining to an agency's compliance with recognition criteria, but not contained in the record, comes to the Secretary's attention while a decision regarding the agency's recognition is pending before the Secretary, and if the Secretary concludes the recognition decision should not be made without consideration of the information, the Secretary either--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> Does not make a decision regarding recognition of the agency; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Does not make a decision regarding recognition of the agency; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Refers the matter to Department staff for review and analysis under Sec.  602.32 or Sec.  602.33, as appropriate, and review by the Advisory Committee under Sec.  602.34; and consideration by the senior Department official under Sec.  602.36; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> Provides the information to the agency and the senior Department official;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provides the information to the agency and the senior Department official;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Permits the agency to respond to the Secretary and the senior Department official in writing, and to include additional evidence relevant to the issue, and specifies a deadline;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provides the senior Department official with an opportunity to respond in writing to the agency's submission under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, specifying a deadline; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Issues a recognition decision based on all the materials described in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> No agency may submit information to the Secretary, or ask others to submit information on its behalf, for purposes of invoking paragraph (f) of this section. Before invoking paragraph (f) of this section, the Secretary will take into account whether the information, if submitted by a third party, could have been submitted in accordance with Sec.  602.32(a) or Sec.  602.33(e)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If the Secretary does not reach a final decision on appeal to approve, deny, limit, suspend, or terminate an agency's recognition before the expiration of its recognition period, the Secretary automatically extends the recognition period until a final decision is reached.
