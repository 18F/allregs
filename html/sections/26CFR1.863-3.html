                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--(1) Scope. Paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section apply to determine the source of income derived from the sale of inventory property (inventory), which a taxpayer produces (in whole or in part) within the United States and sells outside the United States, or which a taxpayer produces (in whole or in part) outside the United States and sells within the United States (Section 863 Sales). To determine the source of income from sales of property produced by the taxpayer, when the property is either produced in whole or in part in space or on or under water not within the jurisdiction (as recognized by the United States) of a foreign country, possession of the United States, or the United States (in international water), or is sold in space or international water, the rules of Sec. 1.863-8 apply, and the rules of this section do not apply except to the extent provided in Sec. 1.863-8. A taxpayer must divide gross income from Section 863 Sales between production activity and sales activity using one of the methods described in paragraph (b) of this section. The source of gross income from

production activity and from sales activity must then be determined under paragraph (c) of this section. Taxable income from Section 863 Sales is determined under paragraph (d) of this section. Paragraph (e) of this section describes the rules for electing the methods described in paragraph (b) of this section and the information that a taxpayer must disclose on a tax return. Paragraph (f) of this section applies to determine the source of certain income derived from a possession of the United States. Paragraph (g) of this section provides special rules for partnerships for all sales subject to Sec. Sec. 1.863-1 through 1.863-3. Paragraph (h) of this section provides effective dates for the rules in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope.

Paragraph (h) of this section provides effective dates for the rules in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules of application for Section 863 Sales. Once a taxpayer has elected a method described in paragraph (b) of this section, the taxpayer must separately apply that method to Section 863 Sales in the United States and to Section 863 Sales outside the United States. In addition, the taxpayer must apply the rules of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section by aggregating all Section 863 Sales to which a method described in paragraph (b) of this section applies, after separately applying that method to Section 863 Sales in the United States and to Section 863 Sales outside the United States. See section 865(i)(1) for the definition of inventory property. See also section 865(e)(2). See Sec. 1.861-7(c) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section for the time and place of sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Methods to determine income attributable to production activity and sales activity--(1) 50/50 method--(i) Determination of gross income. Generally, gross income from Section 863 Sales will be apportioned between production activity and sales activity under the 50/50 method as described in this paragraph (b)(1). Under the 50/50 method, one-half of the taxpayer's gross income will be considered income attributable to production activity and the source of that income will be determined under the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The remaining one-half of such gross income will be considered income attributable to sales activity and the source of that income will be determined under the rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In lieu of the 50/50 method, the taxpayer may elect to determine the source of income from Section 863 Sales under the IFP method described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section or, with the consent of the District Director, the books and records method described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 50/50 method--(i) Determination of gross income. Generally, gross income from Section 863 Sales will be apportioned between production activity and sales activity under the 50/50 method as described in this paragraph (b)(1). Under the 50/50 method, one-half of the taxpayer's gross income will be considered income attributable to production activity and the source of that income will be determined under the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The remaining one-half of such gross income will be considered income attributable to sales activity and the source of that income will be determined under the rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In lieu of the 50/50 method, the taxpayer may elect to determine the source of income from Section 863 Sales under the IFP method described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section or, with the consent of the District Director, the books and records method described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determination of gross income. Generally, gross income from Section 863 Sales will be apportioned between production activity and sales activity under the 50/50 method as described in this paragraph (b)(1). Under the 50/50 method, one-half of the taxpayer's gross income will be considered income attributable to production activity and the source of that income will be determined under the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The remaining one-half of such gross income will be considered income attributable to sales activity and the source of that income will be determined under the rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In lieu of the 50/50 method, the taxpayer may elect to determine the source of income from Section 863 Sales under the IFP method described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section or, with the consent of the District Director, the books and records method described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (b)(1):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P, a U.S. corporation, produces widgets in the United States. P sells the widgets for $100 to D, an unrelated foreign distributor, in another country. P's cost of goods sold is $40. Thus, P's gross income is $60.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to the 50/50 method, one-half of P's gross income, or $30, is considered income attributable to production activity, and one-half of P's gross income, or $30, is considered income attributable to sales activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> IFP method--(i) Establishing an IFP. A taxpayer may elect to allocate gross income earned from production activity and sales activity using the independent factory price (IFP) method described in this paragraph (b)(2) if an IFP is fairly established. An IFP is fairly established based on a sale by the taxpayer only if the taxpayer regularly sells part of its output to wholly independent distributors or other selling concerns in such a way as to reasonably reflect the income earned from production activity. A sale will not be considered to fairly establish an IFP if sales activity by the taxpayer with respect to that sale is significant in relation to all of the activities with respect to that product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Establishing an IFP. A taxpayer may elect to allocate gross income earned from production activity and sales activity using the independent factory price (IFP) method described in this paragraph (b)(2) if an IFP is fairly established. An IFP is fairly established based on a sale by the taxpayer only if the taxpayer regularly sells part of its output to wholly independent distributors or other selling concerns in such a way as to reasonably reflect the income earned from production activity. A sale will not be considered to fairly establish an IFP if sales activity by the taxpayer with respect to that sale is significant in relation to all of the activities with respect to that product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Applying the IFP method. If the taxpayer elects to use the IFP method, the amount of the gross sales price equal to the IFP will be treated as attributable to production activity, and the excess of the gross sales price over the IFP will be treated as attributable to sales activity. If a taxpayer elects to use the IFP method, the IFP must be applied to all Section 863 Sales of inventory that are substantially similar in physical characteristics and function, and are sold at a similar level of distribution as the inventory sold in the sale fairly establishing an IFP. The IFP will only be applied to sales that are reasonably contemporaneous with the sale fairly establishing the IFP. An

IFP cannot be applied to sales in other geographic markets if the markets are substantially different. If the taxpayer elects the IFP method, the rules of this paragraph will also apply to determine the division of gross receipts between production activity and sales activity in a Section 863 Sale that itself fairly establishes an IFP. If the taxpayer elects to apply the IFP method, the IFP method must be applied to all sales for which an IFP may be fairly established and applied for that taxable year and each subsequent taxable year. The taxpayer will apply either the 50/50 method described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or the books and records method described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section to any other Section 863 Sale for which an IFP cannot be established or applied for each taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination of gross income. The amount of a taxpayer's gross income from production activity is determined by reducing the amount of gross receipts from production activity by the cost of goods sold properly attributable to production activity. The amount of a taxpayer's gross income from sales activity is determined by reducing the amount of gross receipts from sales activity by the cost of goods sold (if any) properly attributable to sales activity. The source of gross income from production activity is determined under the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the source of gross income from sales activity will be determined under the rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(2):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P, a U.S. producer, purchases cotton and produces cloth in the United States. P sells cloth in country X to D, an unrelated foreign clothing manufacturer, for $100. Cost of goods sold for cloth is $80, entirely attributable to production activity. P does not engage in significant sales activity in relation to its other activities in the sales to D. Under these facts, the sale to D fairly establishes an IFP of $100. Assume that P elects to use the IFP method. Accordingly, $100 of the gross sales price is treated as attributable to production activity, and no amount of income from this sale is attributable to sales activity. After reducing the gross sales price by cost of goods sold, $20 of the gross income is treated as attributable to production activity ($100-$80).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> P also sells cloth in country X to A, an unrelated foreign retail outlet, for $110. Because P elected the IFP method and the cloth is substantially similar to the cloth sold to D, the IFP fairly established in the sales to D must be used to determine the amount attributable to production activity in the sale to A. Accordingly, $100 of the gross sales price is treated as attributable to production activity and $10 ($110-$100) is attributable to sales activity. After reducing the gross sales price by cost of goods sold, $20 of the gross income is treated as attributable to production activity ($100-$80) and $10 is attributable to sales activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> USCo manufactures three dissimilar products. USCo elects to apply the IFP method. In year 1, an IFP can be established for sales of product X, but not for products Y and Z. In year 2, an IFP cannot be established for any of USCo's products. In year 3, an IFP can be established for products X and Y, but not for product Z.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In year 1, USCo must apply the IFP method to sales of product X. In year 2, although USCo's IFP election remains in effect, USCo is not required to apply the IFP election to any products. In year 3, USCo is required to apply the IFP method to sales of products X and Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Books and records method. A taxpayer may elect to determine the amount of its gross income from Section 863 Sales that is attributable to production and sales activities for the taxable year based upon its books of account if it has received in advance the permission of the District Director having audit responsibility over its tax return. The taxpayer must establish to the satisfaction of the District Director that the taxpayer, in good faith and unaffected by considerations of tax liability, will regularly employ in its books of account a detailed allocation of receipts and expenditures which clearly reflects the amount of the taxpayer's income from production and sales activities. If a taxpayer receives permission to apply the books and records method, but does not comply with a material condition set forth by the District Director, the District Director may, in its discretion, revoke permission to use the books and records method. The source of gross income treated as attributable to production activity under this method may be determined under the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the source of gross income attributable to

sales activity will be determined under the rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination of the source of gross income from production activity and sales activity--(1) Income attributable to production activity--(i) Production only within the United States or only within foreign countries--(A) Source of income. For purposes of this section, production activity means an activity that creates, fabricates, manufactures, extracts, processes, cures, or ages inventory. See Sec. 1.864-1. Subject to the provisions in Sec. 1.1502-13 or paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the only production activities that are taken into account for purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.863-1, 1.863-2, and this section are those conducted directly by the taxpayer. Where the taxpayer's production assets are located only within the United States or only outside the United States, the income attributable to production activity is sourced where the taxpayer's production assets are located. For rules regarding the source of income when production assets are located both within the United States and without the United States, see paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. For rules regarding the source of income when production takes place, in whole or in part, in space or international water, the rules of Sec. 1.863-8 apply, and the rules of this section do not apply except to the extent provided in Sec. 1.863-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Income attributable to production activity--(i) Production only within the United States or only within foreign countries--(A) Source of income.

Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-13 and paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, production assets include only tangible and intangible assets owned directly by the taxpayer that are directly used by the taxpayer to produce inventory described in paragraph (a) of this section. Production assets do not include assets that are not directly used to produce inventory described in paragraph (a) of this section. Thus, production assets do not include such assets as accounts receivables, intangibles not related to production of inventory (e.g., marketing intangibles, including trademarks and customer lists), transportation assets, warehouses, the inventory itself, raw materials, or work-in-process. In addition, production assets do not include cash or other liquid assets (including working capital), investment assets, prepaid expenses, or stock of a subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Location of production assets. For purposes of this section, a tangible production asset will be considered located where the asset is physically located. An intangible production asset will be considered located where the tangible production assets owned by the taxpayer to which it relates are located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Production both within the United States and within foreign countries--(A) Source of income. Where the taxpayer's production assets are located both within and without the United States, income from sources without the United States will be determined by multiplying the income attributable to the taxpayer's production activity by a fraction, the numerator of which is the average adjusted basis of production assets that are located outside the United States and the denominator of which is the average adjusted basis of all production assets within and without the United States. The remaining income is treated as from sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Source of income. Where the taxpayer's production assets are located both within and without the United States, income from sources without the United States will be determined by multiplying the income attributable to the taxpayer's production activity by a fraction, the numerator of which is the average adjusted basis of production assets that are located outside the United States and the denominator of which is the average adjusted basis of all production assets within and without the United States. The remaining income is treated as from sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adjusted basis of production assets. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the adjusted basis of an asset is determined under section 1011. The average adjusted basis is computed by averaging the adjusted basis of the asset at the beginning and end of the taxable year, unless by reason of material changes during the taxable year such average does not fairly represent the average for such year. In this event, the average adjusted basis will be determined upon a more appropriate basis. If production assets are used to produce inventory sold in Section 863 Sales and are also used to produce other property during the taxable year, the portion of its adjusted basis that is included in the fraction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section will be determined under any method that reasonably reflects the portion of the assets that produces inventory sold in Section 863 Sales. For example, the portion of such an asset that is included in the formula may be determined by multiplying the asset's average adjusted basis by a fraction, the numerator of which is the gross receipts from sales of inventory from

Section 863 Sales produced by the asset, and the denominator of which is the gross receipts from all property produced by that asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Anti-abuse rule. The purpose of this paragraph (c)(1) is to attribute the source of the taxpayer's production income to the location of the taxpayer's production activity. Therefore, if the taxpayer has entered into or structured one or more transactions with a principal purpose of reducing its U.S. tax liability by manipulating the formula described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section in a manner inconsistent with the purpose of this paragraph (c)(1), the District Director may make appropriate adjustments so that the source of the taxpayer's income from production activity more clearly reflects the source of that income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c)(1):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, a U.S. corporation, produces widgets that are sold both within the United States and within a foreign country. The initial manufacture of all widgets occurs in the United States. The second stage of production of widgets that are sold within a foreign country is completed within the country of sale. A's U.S. plant and machinery which is involved in the initial manufacture of the widgets has an average adjusted basis of $200. A also owns warehouses used to store work-in-process. A owns foreign equipment with an average adjusted basis of $25. A's gross receipts from all sales of widgets is $100, and its gross receipts from export sales of widgets is $25. Assume that apportioning average adjusted basis using gross receipts is reasonable. Assume A's cost of goods sold from the sale of widgets in the foreign countries is $13 and thus, its gross income from widgets sold in foreign countries is $12. A uses the 50/50 method to divide its gross income between production activity and sales activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A determines its production gross income from sources without the United States by multiplying one-half of A's $12 of gross income from sales of widgets in foreign countries, or $6, by a fraction, the numerator of which is all relevant foreign production assets, or $25, and the denominator of which is all relevant production assets, or $75 ($25 foreign assets + ($200 U.S. assets x $25 gross receipts from export sales/$100 gross receipts from all sales)). Therefore, A's gross production income from sources without the United States is $2 ($6x($25/$75)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Location of intangible property. Assume the same facts as Example 1, except that A employs a patented process that applies only to the initial production of widgets. In computing the formula used to determine the source of income from production activity, A's patent, if it has an average adjusted basis, would be located in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as Example 1. A sells its U.S. assets to B, an unrelated U.S. corporation, with a principal purpose of reducing its U.S. tax liability by manipulating the property fraction. A then leases these assets from B. After this transaction, under the general rule of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, all of A's production income would be considered from sources without the United States, because all of A's relevant production assets are located within a foreign country. Since the leased property is not owned by the taxpayer, it is not included in the fraction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because A has entered into a transaction with a principal purpose of reducing its U.S. tax liability by manipulating the formula described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, A's income must be adjusted to more clearly reflect the source of that income. In this case, the District Director may redetermine the source of A's production income by ignoring the sale-leaseback transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Income attributable to sales activity. The source of the taxpayer's income that is attributable to sales activity will be determined under the provisions of Sec. 1.861-7(c). Notwithstanding any other provision, for rules regarding the source of income when a sale takes place in space or international water, the rules of Sec. 1.863-8 apply, and the rules of this section do not apply except to the extent provided in Sec. 1.863-8. However, notwithstanding any other provision, for purposes of section 863, the place of sale will be presumed to be the United States if personal property is wholly produced in the United States and the property is sold for use, consumption, or disposition in the United States. See Sec. 1.864-6(b)(3)(ii) to determine the country of use, consumption, or disposition. Also, in applying this paragraph, property will be treated as wholly produced in the United States if it is subject to no more than packaging, repackaging, labeling, or other minor assembly operations outside the United States, within the meaning of Sec. 1.954-3(a)(4)(iii) (property manufactured or produced by a controlled foreign corporation). Notwithstanding any other provision, for rules regarding

the source of income when a sale takes place in space or international water, the rules of Sec. 1.863-8 apply, and the rules of this section do not apply except to the extent provided in Sec. 1.863-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determination of source of taxable income. Once the source of gross income has been determined under paragraph (c) of this section, the taxpayer must properly allocate and apportion separately under Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T the amounts of its expenses, losses, and other deductions to its respective amounts of gross income from Section 863 Sales determined separately under each method described in paragraph (b) of this section. In addition, if the taxpayer deducts expenses for research and development under section 174 that may be attributed to its Section 863 Sales under Sec. 1.861-8(e)(3), the taxpayer must separately allocate or apportion expenses, losses, and other deductions to its respective amounts of gross income from each relevant product category that the taxpayer uses in applying the rules of Sec. 1.861-8(e)(3)(i)(A). In the case of gross income from Section 863 Sales determined under the IFP method or the books and records method, the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T must apply to properly allocate or apportion amounts of expenses, losses and other deductions allocated and apportioned to such gross income between gross income from sources within and without the United States. In the case of gross income from Section 863 Sales determined under the 50/50 method, the amounts of expenses, losses, and other deductions allocated and apportioned to such gross income must be apportioned between sources within and without the United States pro rata based on the relative amounts of gross income from sources within and without the United States determined under the 50/50 method. Research and experimental expenditures qualifying under Sec. 1.861-17 are allocated under that section, and are not allocated and apportioned pro rata under the 50/50 method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Election and reporting rules--(1) Elections under paragraph (b) of this section. If a taxpayer does not elect a method specified in paragraph (b) (2) or (3) of this section, the taxpayer must apply the method specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The taxpayer may elect to apply the method specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by using the method on a timely filed original return (including extensions). A taxpayer may elect to apply the method specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section by using the method on a timely filed original return (including extensions), but only if the taxpayer has received permission from the District Director to apply that method. Once a method under paragraph (b) of this section has been used, that method must be used in later taxable years unless the Commissioner consents to a change.

The widgets are manufactured in the partnership's plant located in the United States and are sold by the partnership outside the United States. The partnership owns the manufacturing facility and all other production assets used to produce the widgets. A's distributive share of partnership income includes 50 percent of the sales income from these sales. In applying the rules of section 863 to determine the source of its distributive share of partnership income from the export sales of widgets, A is treated as carrying on the activity of the partnership related to production of these widgets and as owning a proportionate share of the partnership's assets related to production of the widgets, based upon its distributive share of partnership income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

A then further processes the widgets and then sells them outside the United States. In determining the source of the income earned by A on the sales outside the United States, A is treated as conducting the activities of the partnership related to production of the distributed widgets. Thus, the source of gross income on the sale of the widgets is determined under section 863 and these regulations. A applies the 50/50 method described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to determine the source of income from the sales.
