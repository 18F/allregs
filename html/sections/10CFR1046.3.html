The Designated Physician and PPMD must determine that the reasonable accommodation is consistent with the medical certification standards without creating a direct threat to the individual or to others.</p><p class="depth0">Designated Physician means an MD or DO, licensed without restriction in the state of practice, who has been approved by the PPMD. The Office of Health, Safety and Security must be consulted regarding an individual's suitability prior to appointment as a Designated Physician.</p><p class="depth0">Direct threat means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others. The risk must be based on an assessment of the individual's present ability to perform safely the essential functions of the job, and it must be determined that the risk cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.</p><p class="depth0">DOE facility means any facility required by DOE to employ PF personnel and used by DOE, including NNSA, and its contractors for the performance of work under DOE jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency conditions are those conditions that could arise at a DOE facility as a result of a breach of security (e.g., sabotage or terrorism), accident (e.g., fire or explosion), or naturally occurring event (e.g., storm or earthquake) and threaten the security or integrity of DOE facilities, assets, personnel, the environment or the general public. For the purposes of this rule, emergency conditions include PF drills and exercises relating to search, rescue, crowd control, fire suppression and special operations, including response to the

These interests may include (but are not limited to) Department and contractor personnel; sensitive technology; classified matter; nuclear weapons, components, and assemblies; special nuclear material (SNM) as defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as amended) and the Department; other nuclear materials; secure communications centers; sensitive compartmented information facilities; automated data processing centers or facilities storing and transmitting classified information; vital equipment; or other Department property.</p><p class="depth0">Security Officer (SO) means an unarmed uniformed PF member who has no Departmental arrest or detention authority, used to support SPOs and/or to perform duties (e.g., administrative, access control, facility patrol, escort, assessment and reporting of alarms) where an armed presence is not required.</p><p class="depth0">Security Police Officer (SPO) means a uniformed PF member who is authorized under section 161(k) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, section 661 of the DOE Organization Act, or other statutory authority, to carry firearms and to make arrests without warrant for specifically enumerated offenses and who is employed for, and charged with, the protection of Department security interests.</p><p class="depth0">Semi-structured interview means, for the purpose of this part, an interview by a Psychologist who meets standards established by DOE and who has the latitude to vary the focus and content of the questions depending upon the interviewee's responses.</p><p class="depth0">Special Response Team, commonly referred to as SRT, means a PF special operations unit comprised of SPOs whose primary mission is to resolve incidents that require activities and force options that exceed the capability of existing physical security systems (e.g., performance of recapture/recovery operations and augmentation of denial missions).</p><p class="depth0">Special Response Team (SRT) Member means SPOs who meet the ARS, with additional training and qualification requirements as necessary, and who are assigned to an SRT that trains and responds as a team to perform recapture and recovery and to augment denial missions, e.g., those missions that require adversaries be denied proximity to the protected property.</p><p class="depth0">Weapons proficiency demonstration means a process based on a predetermined, objective set of criteria approved by the respective program office in consultation with the Office of Health, Safety and Security that results in a grade (e.g., pass/fail). The process must ensure that an individual (or team, for crew-served weapons) demonstrates the ability to perform all

weapons-handling and operational manipulations necessary to load, operate, and discharge a weapon system accurately and safely (to include clearing/returning to safe mode the weapons system at the conclusion of firing), without the necessity for scoring targets during the course of fire. Proficiency courses of fire must include tactically-relevant time constraints. Demonstrations of proficiency are allowed with the actual weapon and assigned duty load, with alternate loads (e.g., frangible or dye-marking rounds), or with authorized weapons system simulators, as defined in this section. Proficiency courses of fire must be tactically relevant.</p><p class="depth0">Weapons qualification is a formal test of weapons proficiency that includes, in addition to all specified elements of proficiency demonstration, the achievement of a prescribed qualification score according to a Departmentally-approved course of fire. Weapons qualification courses of fire must be constrained by time.</p><p class="depth0">Weapons system simulator means a device that closely simulates all major aspects of employing the corresponding actual firearm/weapons system, without firing live ammunition. The simulator should permit all weapons-handling and operational actions required by the actual weapon, and should allow the use of sight settings similar to the corresponding actual weapon with assigned duty loads. Additionally, when weapons or weapons system simulators are used for qualification testing of protective force officers, the operation of the simulated weapon must closely approximate all weapons handling and operational manipulation actions required by the actual weapon. The simulation system must precisely register on-target hits and misses with accuracy comparable to the actual weapon at the same shooting distances. The weight, balance, and sighting systems should closely replicate those of the corresponding actual weapon with assigned duty loads, and noise signatures and felt recoil should be simulated to the extent technically feasible.</p><p class="depth0">Work hardening is discussed by the Department of Labor in their Division of Federal Employees' Compensation Procedure Manual, 2-813-12 (available at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dfec/procedure-manual.htm), as a physical therapy program which will facilitate return-to-work. Work hardening is also known as an Occupational Rehabilitation Program.</p>
