disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the Department.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the Department shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with a disability.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Department need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature to applicants or participants in programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the Department communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, the Department shall use telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TTYs) or equally effective telecommunication systems to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Department shall make available to interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department shall post notices at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to an accessible facility, or to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities.

The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Secretary of Homeland Security (or his or her designee) after considering all resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Department shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with a disability receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</p>
