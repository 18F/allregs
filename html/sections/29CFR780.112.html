                                Sec. 780.112  General meaning of ``agriculture or horticultural commodities.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 3(f) of the Act defines as ``agriculture'' the ``production,  cultivation, growing, and harvesting'' of ``agricultural or  horticultural commodities,'' and employees employed in such operations  are engaged in agriculture. In general, within the meaning of the Act,  ``agricultural or horticultural commodities'' refers to commodities  resulting from the application of agricultural or horticultural  techniques. Insofar as the term refers to products of the soil, it means  commodities that are planted and cultivated by man. Among such  commodities are the following: Grains, forage crops, fruits, vegetables,  nuts, sugar crops, fiber crops, tobacco, and nursery products. Thus,  employees engaged in growing wheat, corn, hay, onions, carrots, sugar  cane, seed, or any other agricultural or horticultural commodity are  engaged in ``agriculture.'' In addition to such products of the soil,  however, the term includes domesticated animals and some of their  products such as milk, wool, eggs, and honey. The term does not include  commodities produced by industrial techniques, by exploitation of  mineral wealth or other natural resources, or by uncultivated natural  growth. For example, peat humus or peat moss is not an agricultural  commodity. Wirtz v. Ti Ti Peat Humus Co., 373 f(2d) 209 (C.A.4).</p>
