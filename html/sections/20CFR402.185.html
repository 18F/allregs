                                Sec. 402.185  Waiver or reduction of fees in the public interest.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standard. We will waive or reduce the fees we would otherwise charge if disclosure of the information meets both tests which are explained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public interest. The disclosure passes the first test only if it furthers the specific public interest of being likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities, regardless of any other public interest it may further. In analyzing this question, we will consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> How, if at all, do the records to be disclosed pertain to the operations or activities of the Federal Government?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Would disclosure of the records reveal any meaningful information about government operations or activities? Can one learn from these records anything about such operations that is not already public knowledge?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Will the disclosure advance the understanding of the general public as distinguished from a narrow segment of interested persons? Under this factor we may consider whether the requester is in a position to contribute to public understanding. For example, we may consider whether the requester has such knowledge or expertise as may be necessary to understand the information, and whether the requester's intended use of the information would be likely to disseminate the information among the public. An unsupported claim to be doing research for a book or article does not demonstrate that likelihood, while such a claim by a representative of the news media is better evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Will the contribution to public understanding be a significant one? Will the public's understanding of the government's operations be substantially greater as a result of the disclosure?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Not primarily in the requester's commercial interest. If the disclosure passes

the test of furthering the specific public interest described in paragraph (b) of this section, we will determine whether it also furthers the requester's commercial interest and, if so, whether this effect outweighs the advancement of that public interest. In applying this second test, we will consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Would the disclosure further a commercial interest of the requester, or of someone on whose behalf the requester is acting? ``Commercial interests'' include interests relating to business, trade, and profit. Not only profit-making corporations have commercial interests--so do nonprofit corporations, individuals, unions, and other associations. The interest of a representative of the news media in using the information for news dissemination purposes will not be considered a commercial interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If disclosure would further a commercial interest of the requester, would that effect outweigh the advancement of the public interest defined in paragraph (b) of this section? Which effect is primary?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Deciding between waiver and reduction. If the disclosure passes both tests, we will normally waive fees. However, in some cases we may decide only to reduce the fees. For example, we may do this when disclosure of some but not all of the requested records passes the tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedure for requesting a waiver or reduction. You must make your request for a waiver or reduction at the same time you make your request for records. You should explain why you believe a waiver or reduction is proper under the analysis in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. Only FOI Officers may make the decision whether to waive, or reduce, the fees. If we do not completely grant your request for a waiver or reduction, the denial letter will designate a review official. You may appeal the denial to that official. In your appeal letter, you should discuss whatever reasons are given in our denial letter. The process prescribed in Sec. 402.190 of this part will also apply to these appeals.</p>
