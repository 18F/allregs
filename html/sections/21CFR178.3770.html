It is of the greatest importance  that all glassware be scrupulously cleaned to remove all organic matter  such as oil, grease, detergent residues, etc. Examine all glassware,  including stoppers and stopcocks, under ultraviolet light to detect any  residual fluorescent contamination. As a precautionary measure it is  recommended practice to rinse all glassware with purified isooctane  immediately before use. No grease is to be used on stopcocks or joints.  Great care to avoid contamination of wax samples in handling and to  assure absence of any extraneous material arising from inadequate  packaging is essential. Because some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons  sought in this test   are very susceptible to photo-oxidation, the entire procedure is to be  carried out under subdued light.</p><p class="depth3">apparatus</p><p class="depth3">Separatory funnels. 250-milliliter, 500-milliliter, 1,000- milliliter, and preferably 2,000-milliliter capacity, equipped with  tetrafluoroethylene polymer stopcocks.</p><p class="depth3">Reservoir. 1,000-milliliter capacity, equipped with a 24/40 standard  taper male fitting at the bottom and a suitable balljoint at the top.</p><p class="depth3">Chromatographic tube. 1,200 millimeters in length, inside diameter  to be 16.5 millimeters [0.5 millimeter, equipped with a coarse, fritted- glass disc, a tetrafluoroethylene polymer stopcock, and a female 24/40  standard tapered fitting at the opposite end.

All solvents used throughout the procedure shall  meet the specifications and tests described in this specification. The  isooctane and benzene designated in the list following this paragraph  shall pass the following test:</p><p class="depth3">To be specified quantity of solvent in a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer  flask, add 1 milliliter of purified n-hexadecane and evaporate on the  steam bath under a stream of nitrogen (a loose aluminum foil jacket  around the flask will speed evaporation). Discontinue evaporation when  not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. (To the residue from benzene  add a 10-milliliter portion of purified isooctane, reevaporate, and  repeat once to insure complete removal of benzene.)</p><p class="depth3">Alternatively, the evaporation time can be reduced by using the  optional evaporation flask. In this case the solvent and n-hexadecane  are placed in the flask on the steam bath, the tube assembly is  inserted, and a stream of nitrogen is fed through the inlet tube while  the outlet tube is connected to a solvent trap and vacuum line in such a  way as to prevent any flow-back of condensate into the flask.</p><p class="depth3">Dissolve the 1 milliliter of hexadecane residue in isooctane and  make up to 25 milliliters volume. Determine the absorbance in the 1- centimeter pathlength cells compared to isooctane as reference. The  absorbance of the solution of the solvent residue (except for methyl  alcohol) shall not exceed 0.01 per centimeter pathlength between 280  m and 400 m.</p><p class="depth3">Isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane). Use 180 milliliters for the test  described in the preceding paragraph. Purify, if necessary, by passage  through a column of activated silica gel (Grade 12, Davison Chemical  Co., Baltimore, Md., or equivalent) about 90 centimeters in length and 5  centimeters to 8 centimeters in diameter.</p><p class="depth3">Benzene, A.C.S. reagent grade. Use 150 milliliters for the test.  Purify, if necessary, by distillation or otherwise.</p><p class="depth3">n-Hexadecane, 99 percent olefin-free. Dilute 1.0 milliliter of n- hexadecane to 25 milliliters with isooctane and determine the absorbance  in a 1-centimeter cell compared to isooctane as reference point between  280 m-400 m. The absorbance per centimeter pathlength  shall not exceed 0.00 in this range. If necessary, purify by filtering  through a column containing 100 grams of aluminum oxide (use same grade  as described below) in the lower half and 100 grams of activated silica  gel in the upper half keeping the column at 150 C., for a period of 15  hours or overnight. The first 100 milliliters of eluate are used.  Purification can also be accomplished by distillation.</p><p class="depth3">Dimethyl sulfoxide. Pure grade, clear, water-white, m.p. 18  minimum. Dilute 120 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide with 240  milliliters of distilled water in a 500-milliliter separatory funnel,  mix and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes. Add 40 milliliters of isooctane  to the solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2  minutes. Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second 500-milliliter  separatory funnel and repeat the extraction with 40 milliliters of  isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each of the 40- milliliter extractives three times with 50-milliliter portions of  distilled water. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Discard the  aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous sodium  sulfate prewashed with isooctane (see Sodium sulfate under ``Reagents  and materials'' for preparation of filter), into a 250-milliliter  Erlenmeyer flask, or optionally into the evaporating flask. Wash the  first separatory funnel with the second 40-milliliter isooctane  extractive, and pass through the sodium sulfate into the flask. Then  wash the second and first separatory funnels successively with a 10- milliliter portion of isooctane, and pass the solvent through the sodium  sulfate into the flask. Add 1 milliliter of n-hexadecane and evaporate  the isooctane on the steam bath under nitrogen. Discontinue evaporation  when not over 1 milliliter of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10- milliliter portion of isooctane and reevaporate to 1 milliliter of  hexadecane. Again, add 10 milliliters of isooctane to the residue and  evaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane to insure complete removal of  all volatile materials. Dissolve the 1 milliliter of hexadecane in  isooctane and make to 25-milliliter volume. Determine the absorbance in  1-centimeter pathlength cells compared to isooctane as reference. The  absorbance of the solution should not exceed 0.02 per centimeter  pathlength in the 280 m-400 m range. (Note: Difficulty  in meeting this absorbance specification may be due to organic  impurities in the distilled water. Repetition of the test omitting the  dimethyl sulfoxide will disclose their presence. If necessary to meet  the specification, purify the water by redistillation, passage through  an ion-exchange resin, or otherwise.)</p><p class="depth3">Purify, if necessary, by the following procedure: To 1,500  milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 2-liter glass-stoppered flask,  add 6.0 milliliters of phosphoric acid and 50 grams of Norit A  (decolorizing carbon, alkaline) or equivalent. Stopper the flask, and  with the use of a magnetic stirrer (tetrafluoroethylene polymer coated  bar) stir the solvent for 15 minutes. Filter the dimethyl sulfoxide  through four thicknesses of fluted paper (18.5 centimeters, Schleicher &  Schuell, No. 597, or equivalent). If the initial filtrate contains  carbon fines, refilter through the same filter until a clear filtrate is  obtained. Protect the sulfoxide from air and moisture during this  operation by covering the solvent in the funnel and collection flask  with a layer of isooctane. Transfer the filtrate to a 2-liter separatory  funnel and draw off the dimethyl sulfoxide into the 2-liter distillation  flask of the vacuum distillation assembly and distill at approximately  3-millimeter Hg pressure or less. Discard the first 200-milliliter  fraction of the distillate and replace the distillate collection flask  with a clean one. Continue the distillation until approximately 1 liter  of the sulfoxide has been collected.</p><p class="depth3">At completion of the distillation, the reagent should be stored in  glass-stoppered bottles since it is very hygroscopic and will react with  some metal containers in the presence of air.</p><p class="depth3">Phosphoric acid. 85 percent A.C.S. reagent grade.</p><p class="depth3">Aluminum oxide (80-200 mesh Woelm neutral activity grade 1  [Brockmann], Alupharm Chemicals, New Orleans, La., or equivalent).  Pipette 1 milliliter of distilled water into a dry 250-milliliter  Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a ground-glass stopper. Stopper the flask  and rotate it in such a manner as to completely wet out the inside  surfaces. When this has been done add 180 grams of the aluminum oxide  and shake until no lumps or wet spots   remain. Allow to stand at room temperature for a period of 2 hours. At  the end of this time the water should be evenly distributed throughout  the aluminum oxide powder, and it should have the same free flowing  properties as the original material (flow velocity with water 0.2  milliliter per minute). At this point the aluminum oxide has an activity  of 1 as expressed in Brockmann degrees, and the amount of added water is  0.5 percent by volume. This product is used in toto and as is, without  further screening.</p><p class="depth3">Sodium sulfate, anhydrous, A.C.S. reagent grade, preferably in  granular form. For each bottle of sodium sulfate reagent used, establish  as follows the necessary sodium sulfate prewash to provide such filters  required in the method: Place approximately 35 grams of anhydrous sodium  sulfate in a 30-milliliter coarse, fritted-glass funnel or in a 65- millimeter filter funnel with glass wool plug; wash with successive 15- milliliter portions of the indicated solvent until a 15-milliliter  portion of the wash shows 0.00 absorbance per centimeter pathlength  between 280 m and 400 m when tested as prescribed  under ``Organic solvents.'' Usually three portions of wash solvent are  sufficient.</p><p class="depth3">procedure</p><p class="depth3">Before proceeding with analysis of a sample, determine the  absorbance in a 1-centimeter path cell between 250 m and 400  m for the reagent blank by carrying out the procedure, without  a wax sample, at room temperature, recording the spectrum after the  complete procedure as prescribed. The absorbance per centimeter  pathlength following the complete procedure should not exceed 0.04 in  the wavelength range from 280 m to 299 m, inclusive,  nor 0.02 in the wavelength range from 300 m to 400 m.  If in either spectrum the characteristic benzene peaks in the 250  m-260 m region are present, remove the benzene by the  procedure under ``Organic solvents'' and record absorbance again. Place  300 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide in a 1-liter separatory funnel and  add 75 milliliters of phosphoric acid. Mix the contents of the funnel  and allow to stand for 10 minutes. (The reaction between the sulfoxide  and the acid is exothermic. Release pressure after mixing, then keep  funnel stoppered.) Add 150 milliliters of isooctane and shake to  preequilibrate the solvents. Draw off the individual layers and store in  glass-stoppered flasks.</p><p class="depth3">In a 1-liter separatory funnel place a representative 25-gram sample  of wax, add 50 milliliters of isooctane, heat gently, stir until the wax  is in solution; add 100 milliliters of preequilibrated sulfoxide- phosphoric acid mixture and shake, making sure it remains in solution.  If the wax comes out of solution during these operations, let the  stoppered funnel remain in the jacket until the wax redissolves. (Remove  stopper from the funnel at intervals to release pressure.) When the wax  is in solution, remove the funnel from the jacket and shake it  vigorously for 2 minutes. Set up three 250-milliliter separatory funnels  with each containing 30 milliliters of preequilibrated isooctane. After  separation of the liquid phases, allow to cool until the main portion of  the wax-isooctane solution begins to show a precipitate. Gently swirl  the funnel when precipitation first occurs on the inside surface of the  funnel to accelerate this process. Carefully draw off the lower layer,  filter it slowly through a thin layer of glass wool fitted loosely in a  filter funnel into the first 250-milliliter separatory funnel, and wash  in tandem with the 30-milliliter portions of isooctane contained in the  250-milliliter separatory funnels. Shaking time for each wash is 1  minute. Repeat the extraction operation with two additional portions of  the sulfoxide-acid mixture, replacing the funnel in the jacket after  each extraction to keep the wax in solution and washing each extractive  in tandem through the same three portions of isooctane.</p><p class="depth3">Collect the successive extractives (300 milliliters total) in a  separatory funnel (preferably 2-liter), containing 480 milliliters of  distilled water, mix, and allow to cool for a few minutes after the last  extractive has been added. Add 80 milliliters of isooctane to the  solution and extract by shaking the funnel vigorously for 2 minutes.  Draw off the lower aqueous layer into a second separatory funnel  (preferably 2-liter) and repeat the extraction with 80 milliliters of  isooctane. Draw off and discard the aqueous layer. Wash each of the 80- milliliter extractives three times with 100-milliliter portions of  distilled water. Shaking time for each wash is 1 minute. Discard the  aqueous layers. Filter the first extractive through anhydrous sodium  sulfate prewashed with isooctane (see Sodium sulfate under ``Reagents  and Materials'' for preparation of filter) into a 250-milliliter  Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into the evaporation flask). Wash the  first separatory funnel with the second 80-milliliter isooctane  extractive and pass through the sodium sulfate. Then wash the second and  first separatory funnels successively with a 20-milliliter portion of  isooctane and pass the solvent through the sodium sulfate into the  flask. Add 1 milliliter of n-hexadecane and evaporate the isooctane  using an aspirator vacuum under nitrogen and in an oil bath temperature  of approximately 90 C. Discontinue evaporation when not over 1  milliliter of residue remains. To the residue, add a 10-milliliter  portion of isooctane, reevaporate to 1 milliliter of hexadecane, and  repeat this operation once.</p><p class="depth3">Reserve the residue for column chromatography on the aluminum oxide.  Fit the tetrafluoroethylene polymer disc on the upper part of the stem  of the   chromatographic tube, then place the tube with the disc on the suction  flask and apply the vacuum (approximately 135 millimeters Hg pressure).  Weigh out 180 grams of the aluminum oxide and pour the adsorbent mixture  into the chromatographic tube in approximately 30-centimeter layers.  After the addition of each layer, level off the top of the adsorbent  with a flat glass rod or metal plunger by pressing down firmly until the  adsorbent is well packed. Loosen the topmost few millimeters of each  adsorbent layer with the end of a metal rod before the addition of the  next layer. Continue packing in this manner until all the 180 grams of  the adsorbent is added to the tube. Level off the top of the adsorbent  by pressing down firmly with a flat glass rod or metal plunger to make  the depth of the adsorbent bed approximately 80 centimeters in depth.  Turn off the vacuum and remove the suction flask. Dissolve the  hexadecane residue in 10 milliliters of warm benzene and decant the  solution onto the column and allow the liquid level to recede to barely  above the adsorbent level. Rapidly complete the transfer similarly with  two 10-milliliter portions of benzene swirling the flask repeatedly each  time to assure adequate washing of the residue. Fix the 1,000-milliliter  reservoir onto the top of the chromatographic column. Just before the  final 10-milliliter wash reaches the top of the adsorbent, add 670  milliliters of benzene to the reservoir and continue the percolation at  the 2-3 milliliter per minute rate until a total of 670 milliliters of  benzene has been utilized. Collect the eluate in a clean 1-liter  Erlenmeyer flask (or optionally into a 1-liter evaporation flask). Allow  the column to drain until most of the solvent mixture is removed. Add 1  milliliter of n-hexadecane and completely remove the benzene by  evaporation under nitrogen, using the special procedure to eliminate  benzene as previously described under ``Organic Solvents.''  Quantitatively transfer the residue with isooctane to a 25-milliliter  volumetric flask and adjust to volume. Determine the absorbance of the  solution in the 1-centimeter pathlength cells compared to isooctane as  reference between 250 m-400 m. Correct for any  absorbance derived from the reagents as determined by carrying out the  procedure without a wax sample. If either spectrum shows the  characteristic benzene peaks in the 250 m-260 m  region, evaporate the solution to remove benzene by the procedure under  ``Organic Solvents.'' Dissolve the residue, transfer quantitatively, and  adjust to volume in isooctane in a 25-milliliter volumetric flask.  Record the absorbance again. If the corrected absorbance does not exceed  the limits prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, the wax meets  the ultraviolet absorbance specifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The polyhydric alcohol esters identified in this paragraph may  be used as release agents in resinous and polymeric coatings for  polyolefin films complying with Sec. 175.320 of this chapter.
