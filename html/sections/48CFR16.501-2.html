                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> There are three types of indefinite-delivery contracts:  Definite-quantity contracts, requirements contracts, and indefinite- quantity contracts. The appropriate type of indefinite-delivery contract  may be used to acquire supplies and/or services when the exact times  and/or exact quantities of future deliveries are not known at the time  of contract award. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304d and 41 U.S.C. 4101,  requirements contracts and indefinite-quantity contracts are also known  as delivery-order contracts or task-order contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The various types of indefinite-delivery contracts offer the  following advantages:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All three types permit (i) Government stocks to be maintained at  minimum levels and (ii) direct shipment to users.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indefinite-quantity contracts and requirements contracts also  permit (i) flexibility in both quantities and delivery scheduling and  (ii) ordering of supplies or services after requirements materialize.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Indefinite-quantity contracts limit the Government's obligation  to the minimum quantity specified in the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requirements contracts may permit faster deliveries when  production lead time is involved, because contractors are usually  willing to maintain limited stocks when the Government will obtain all  of its actual purchase requirements from the contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Indefinite-delivery contracts may provide for any appropriate  cost or pricing arrangement under part 16. Cost or pricing arrangements  that provide for an estimated quantity of supplies or services (e.g.,  estimated number of labor hours) must comply with the appropriate  procedures of this subpart.
