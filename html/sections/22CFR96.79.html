                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except to the extent provided by the procedures in Sec. 96.78, an adverse action by an accrediting entity shall not be subject to administrative review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 202(c)(3) of the IAA (42 U.S.C. 14922(c)(3)) provides for judicial review in Federal court of adverse actions by an accrediting entity, regardless of whether the entity is described in Sec. 96.5(a) or (b). When any petition brought under section 202(c)(3) raises as an issue whether the deficiencies necessitating the adverse action have been corrected, the procedures maintained by the accrediting entity pursuant to Sec. 96.78 must first be exhausted. Adverse actions are only those actions listed in Sec. 96.75. There is no judicial review of an accrediting entity's decision to deny accreditation or approval, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A denial of an initial application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A denial of an application made after cancellation or refusal to renew by the accrediting entity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A denial of an application made after cancellation or debarment by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In accordance with section 202(c)(3) of the IAA (42 U.S.C. 14922(c)(3)), an accredited agency or approved person that is the subject of an adverse action by an accrediting entity may petition the United States district court in the judicial district in which the agency is located or the person resides to set aside the adverse action imposed by the accrediting entity. The United States district court shall review the adverse action in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 706. When an accredited agency or approved person petitions a United States district court to review the adverse action of an accrediting entity, the accrediting entity will be considered an agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 701 for the purpose of judicial review of the adverse action.
