                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before the State Conservationist can score and rank the parcels  for funding, the eligibility of the landowner and the land must be  assessed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State Conservationist will use national and State criteria  to score and rank parcels. The national ranking criteria will be  established by the Chief, and the State criteria will be determined by  the State Conservationist, with advice from the State Technical  Committee. The national criteria will comprise at least half of the  ranking system score.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At least 30 days before the ranking of parcels, the State  Conservationist will announce the date on which ranking of parcels will  occur. A State Conservationist may announce more than one date of  ranking in a fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All parcels submitted throughout the fiscal year will be scored.  All parcels will be ranked together in accordance with the national and  State ranking criteria before parcels are selected for funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The parcels selected for funding will be listed on the  agreements of the entities that submitted the parcels, and the  agreements will be signed by the State Conservationist and the eligible  entity. Funds for each fiscal year's parcels will be obligated with a  new signature each year on an amendment to the agreement. Parcels funded  on each fiscal year's amendment will have a separate deadline for  closing and requesting reimbursement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The national ranking criteria are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Percent of prime, unique, and important farmland in the parcel  to be protected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Percent of cropland, pastureland, grassland, and rangeland in  the parcel to be protected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ratio of the total acres of land in the parcel to be protected  to average farm size in the county according to the most recent USDA  Census of Agriculture;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Decrease in the percentage of acreage of farm and ranch land in  the county in which the parcel is located between the last two USDA  Censuses of Agriculture;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Percent population growth in the county as documented by the  United States Census;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Population density (population per square mile) as documented by  the most recent United States Census;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Proximity of the parcel to other protected land, such as  military installations, land owned in fee title by the United States or  an Indian Tribe, State government or local government, or by a  nongovernmental organization whose purpose is to protect agricultural  use and related conservation values, or land that is already subject to  an easement or deed restriction that limits the conversion of the land  to non-agricultural use;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Proximity of the parcel to other agricultural operations and  infrastructure; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Other additional criteria as determined by the Chief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> State or local criteria as determined by the State  Conservationist, with advice of the State Technical Committee, may  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The location of a parcel in an area zoned for agricultural use;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The performance of an eligible entity's experience in managing  and enforcing easements. Performance must be measured by the closing  efficiency or percentage of parcels that have been monitored and the  percentage of monitoring results that have been reported. The number of  years of an eligible entity's existence, budget, or staffing level will  not be used as a ranking factor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Multifunctional benefits of farm and ranch land protection  including social, economic, historical and archaeological, and  environmental benefits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Geographic regions where the enrollment of particular lands may  help achieve national, State, and regional conservation goals and  objectives, or enhance existing government or private conservation  projects;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Diversity of natural resources to be protected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Score in the Land Evaluation and Site Assessment system. This  score serves as a measure of agricultural viability (access to markets  and infrastructure); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Existence of a farm or ranch succession plan or similar plan  established to encourage farm viability for future generations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> State ranking criteria will be developed on a State-by-State  basis. The State Conservationist will make available a full listing of  applicable national and State ranking criteria.</p>
