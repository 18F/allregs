                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, tanks  designed to be removed from cars for filling and emptying and tanks  built to a Class DOT 107A specification and their safety relief devices  must be retested periodically as specified in Retest Table 1 of  paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Retests may be made at any time during  the calendar year the retest falls due.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pressure test. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each tank must be subjected to the specified  hydrostatic pressure and its permanent expansion determined. Pressure  must be maintained for 30 seconds and for as long as necessary to secure  complete expansion of the tank. Before testing, the pressure gauge must  be shown to be accurate within 1 percent at test measure. The expansion  gauge must be shown to be accurate, at test pressure, to within 1  percent. Expansion must be recorded in cubic cm. Permanent volumetric  expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at  test pressure and the tank must not leak or show evidence of distress.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each tank, except tanks built to specification DOT 107A, must  also be subjected to interior air pressure test of at least 100 psig  under conditions favorable to detection of any leakage. No leaks may  appear.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Safety relief valves must be retested by air or gas, must start- to-discharge at or below the prescribed pressure and must be vapor tight  at or above the prescribed pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rupture discs and fusible plugs must be removed from the tank  and visually inspected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em>, and before returning to service after repairs  involving welding or heat treatment:</p><p class="depth3">Retest Table 1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Retest interval--years   Minimum Retest pressure--   Pressure relief valve</p><p class="depth3">--------------------------           psig                 pressure--psig</p><p class="depth3">---------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Specification                           Pressure       Tank</p><p class="depth3">Tank        relief    hydrostatic    Tank air    Start-to-</p><p class="depth3">devices \d\   expansion       test      discharge   Vapor tight</p><p class="depth3">\c\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DOT 27............................            5            2          500          100          375          300 106A500...........................            5            2          500          100          375          300 106A500X..........................            5            2          500          100          375          300</p><p class="depth3">106A800...........................            5            2          800          100          600          480 106A800X..........................            5            2          800          100          600          480 106A800NCI........................            5            2          800          100          600          480 107A * * * *......................         \d\5         \a\2        (\b\)         None         None         None 110A500-W.........................            5            2          500          100          375          300 110A600-W.........................            5            2          600          100          500          360 110A800-W.........................            5            2          800          100          600          480 110A1000-W........................            5            2        1,000          100          750          600 BE-27.............................            5            2          500          100          375          300 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes: \a\ If DOT 107A * * * * tanks are used for transportation of flammable gases, one rupture disc from each car</p><p class="depth3">must be burst at the interval prescribed. The sample disc must burst at a pressure not exceeding the marked</p><p class="depth3">test pressure of the tank and not less than 70 percent of the marked test pressure. If the sample disc does</p><p class="depth3">not burst within the prescribed limits, all discs on the car must be replaced. \b\ The hydrostatic expansion test pressure must at least equal the marked test pressure. \c\ See Sec. 180.519(b)(1). \d\ Safety relief valves of the spring-loaded type on tanks used exclusively for fluorinated hydrocarbons and</p><p class="depth3">mixtures thereof which are free from corroding components may be retested every 5 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The month and year of test, followed by a ``V'' if visually  inspected as described in paragraph (c) of this section, must be plainly  and permanently stamped into the metal of one head or chime of each tank  with successful test results; for example, 01-90 for January 1990. On  DOT 107A**** tanks, the date must be stamped into the metal of the  marked end, except that if all tanks mounted on a car have been tested,  the date may be stamped into the metal of a plate permanently applied to  the bulkhead on the ``A'' end of the car. Dates of previous tests and  all prescribed markings must be kept legible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Visual inspection. Tanks of Class DOT 106A and DOT 110A-W  specifications (Secs. 179.300 and 179.301 of this subchapter) used  exclusively for transporting fluorinated hydrocarbons and mixtures  thereof, and that are free from corroding components, may be given a  periodic complete internal and external visual inspection in place of  the periodic hydrostatic retest. Visual inspections shall be made only  by competent persons. The tank must be accepted or rejected in  accordance with the criteria in CGA C-6 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this  subchapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Written records. The results of the pressure test and visual  inspection must be recorded on a suitable data sheet. Completed copies  of these reports must be retained by the owner and by the person  performing the pressure test and visual inspection as long as the tank  is in service. The information to be recorded and checked on these data  sheets are: Date of test and inspection; DOT specification number; tank  identification (registered symbol and serial number, date of manufacture  and ownership symbol); type of protective coating (painted, etc., and  statement as to need for refinishing or recoating); conditions checked  (leakage, corrosion, gouges, dents or digs, broken or damaged chime or  protective ring, fire, fire damage, internal condition); test pressure;  results of tests; and disposition of tank (returned to service, returned  to manufacturer for repair, or scrapped); and identification of the  person conducting the retest or inspection.
