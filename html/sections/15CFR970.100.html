                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The purpose of this part is to implement those  responsibilities and authorities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA), pursuant to Public Law 96-283, the Deep Seabed  Hard Mineral Resources Act (the Act), to issue to eligible United States  citizens licenses for the exploration for deep seabed hard minerals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>  thereof. These include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Encouraging the successful conclusion of a comprehensive Law of  the Sea Treaty, which will give legal definition to the principle that  the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed are the common heritage of  mankind and which will assure, among other things, nondiscriminatory  access to such resources for all nations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establishing, pending the ratification by, and entering into  force with respect to, the United States of such a treaty, an interim  program to regulate the exploration for and commercial recovery of hard  mineral resources of the deep seabed by United States citizens;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Accelerating the program of environmental assessment of  exploration for and commercial recovery of hard mineral resources of the  deep seabed and assuring that such exploration and recovery activities  are conducted in a manner which will encourage the conservation of such  resources, protect the quality of the environment, and promote the  safety of life and property at sea;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Encouraging the continued development of technology necessary to  recover the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Pending the ratification by, and entry into force with respect  to, the United States of a Law of the Sea Treaty, providing for the  establishment of an international revenue-sharing fund the proceeds of  which will be used for sharing with the international community pursuant  to such treaty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Regulatory approach. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> These regulations incorporate NOAA's  recognition that the deep seabed mining industry is still evolving and  that more information must be developed to form the basis for future  decisions by industry and by NOAA in its implementation of the Act. They  also recognize the need for flexibility in order to promote the  development of deep seabed mining technology, and the usefulness of  allowing initiative by miners to develop mining techniques and systems  in a manner compatible with the requirements of the Act and regulations.  In this regard, the regulations reflect an approach, pursuant to the  Act, whereby their provisions ultimately will be addressed and evaluated  on the basis of exploration plans submitted by applicants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition, these regulations reflect NOAA's recognition that  the difference in scale and effects between exploration for and  commercial recovery of hard mineral resources normally requires that  they be distinguished and addressed separately. This distinction is also  based upon the evolutionary stage of the seabed mining industry  referenced above. Thus, NOAA will issue separate regulations pertaining  to commercial recovery, in part 971 of this chapter.  [46 FR 45896, Sept. 15, 1981; 47 FR 5966, Feb. 9, 1982]</p>
