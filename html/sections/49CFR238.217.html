and side plate--of all posts, braces and pier panels, to the extent available, on each side of the car located between body corner posts shall be not less than 0.20 multiplied by the distance in feet between the centers of end panels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The center of an end panel is the point midway between the center of the body corner post and the center of the adjacent side post.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The minimum section moduli or thicknesses specified in paragraph (a) of this section may be adjusted in proportion to the ratio of the yield strength of the material used to that of mild open-hearth steel for a car whose structural members are made of a higher strength steel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sheathing. (1) Outside sheathing of mild, open-hearth steel when used flat, without reinforcement (other than side posts) in a side frame of modified girder or semi-monocoque construction shall not be less than \1/8\ inch nominal thickness.
