                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Data used. To calculate the prospective payment rates for  inpatient hospital services furnished by inpatient rehabilitation  facilities, we use--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The most recent Medicare data available, as of the date of  establishing the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment  system, to estimate payments for inpatient operating and capital-related  costs made under part 413 of this subchapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An appropriate wage index to adjust for area wage differences;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An increase factor to adjust for the most recent estimate of  increases in the prices of an appropriate market basket of goods and  services included in covered inpatient rehabilitation services; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Patient assessment data described in Sec. 412.606 and other  data that account for the relative resource utilization of different  patient types.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)(B)(ii)</em> of the Act  for each year through the midpoint of fiscal year 2001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determining the Federal prospective payment rates--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General.  The Federal prospective payment rates will be established using a  standard payment amount referred to as the standard payment conversion  factor. The standard payment conversion factor is a standardized payment  amount based on average costs from a base year that reflects the  combined aggregate effects of the weighting factors, various facility  and case level adjustments, and other adjustments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Update the cost per discharge. CMS applies the increase factor  described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section to the facility's cost per  discharge determined under paragraph (b) of this section to compute the  cost per discharge for fiscal year 2002. Based on the updated cost per  discharge, CMS estimates the payments that would have been made to the  facility for fiscal year 2002 under part 413 of this chapter without  regard   to the prospective payment system implemented under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Computation of the standard payment conversion factor. The  standard payment conversion factor is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For fiscal year 2002. Based on the updated costs per discharge  and estimated payments for fiscal year 2002 determined in paragraph  (c)(2) of this section, CMS computes a standard payment conversion  factor for fiscal year 2002, as specified by CMS, that reflects, as  appropriate, the adjustments described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For fiscal years after 2002. The standard payment conversion  factor for fiscal years after 2002 will be the standardized payments for  the previous fiscal year updated by the increase factor described in  paragraph (a)(3) of this section, including adjustments described in  paragraph (d) of this section as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(ii)</em> of this  section, the applicable increase factor for FY 2014 and for subsequent  years for updating the standard payment conversion factor is the  increase factor described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, including  adjustments described in paragraph (d) of this section as appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of an IRF that is paid under the prospective payment  system specified in Sec. 412.1(a)(3) of this part that does not submit  quality data to CMS, in the form and manner specified by CMS, the  applicable increase factor specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section  is reduced by 2 percentage points.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any reduction of the increase factor will apply only to the  fiscal year involved and will not be taken into account in computing the  applicable increase factor for a subsequent fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determining the Federal prospective payment rate for each case- mix group. The Federal prospective payment rates for each case-mix group  is the product of the weighting factors described in Sec. 412.620(b)  and the standard payment conversion factor described in paragraph (c)(3)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Adjustments to the standard payment conversion factor. The  standard payment conversion factor described in paragraph (c)(3) of this  section will be adjusted for the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Outlier payments. CMS determines a reduction factor equal to the  estimated proportion of additional outlier payments described in  paragraph (e)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Budget neutrality. CMS adjusts the Federal prospective payment  rates for fiscal year 2002 so that aggregate payments under the  prospective payment system, excluding any additional payments associated  with elections not to be paid under the transition period methodology  under Sec. 412.626(b), are estimated to equal the amount that would  have been made to inpatient rehabilitation facilities under part 413 of  this chapter without regard to the prospective payment system  implemented under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Coding and classification changes. CMS adjusts the standard  payment conversion factor for a given year if CMS determines that  revisions in case-mix classifications or weighting factors for a  previous fiscal year (or estimates that those revisions for a future  fiscal year) did result in (or would otherwise result in) a change in  aggregate payments that are a result of changes in the coding or  classification of patients that do not reflect real changes in case-mix.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> and (e)(7), of this section, and to any revision  specified in Sec. 412.620(c) by a factor as specified by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Calculation of the adjusted Federal prospective payment. For  each discharge, an inpatient rehabilitation facility's Federal  prospective payment is computed on the basis of the Federal prospective  payment rate that is in effect for its cost reporting period that begins  in a Federal fiscal year specified under paragraph (c) of this section.  A facility's Federal prospective payment rate will be adjusted, as  appropriate, to account for area wage levels, payments for outliers and  transfers, and for other factors as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of  this section will be made in a budget neutral manner. CMS determines a  budget neutral wage adjustment factor, based on any adjustment or update  to the wage data, to apply to the standard payment conversion factor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjustments for low-income patients. We adjust the Federal  prospective payment, on a facility basis, for the proportion of low- income patients that receive inpatient rehabilitation services as  determined by us.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adjustments for rural areas. We adjust the Federal prospective  payment by a factor, as specified by us for facilities located in rural  areas, as defined in Sec. 412.602.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Adjustments for teaching hospitals. For discharges on or after  October 1, 2005, CMS adjusts the Federal prospective payment on a  facility basis by a factor as specified by CMS for facilities that are  teaching institutions or units of teaching institutions. This adjustment  is made on a claim basis as an interim payment and the final payment in  full for the claim is made during the final settlement of the cost  report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Adjustment for high-cost outliers. CMS provides for an  additional payment to an inpatient rehabilitation facility if its  estimated costs for a patient exceed a fixed dollar amount (adjusted for  area wage levels and factors to account for treating low-income  patients, for rural location, and for teaching programs) as specified by  CMS. The additional payment equals 80 percent of the difference between  the estimated cost of the patient and the sum of the adjusted Federal  prospective payment computed under this section and the adjusted fixed  dollar amount. Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1,  2003, additional payments made under this section will be subject to the  adjustments at Sec. 412.84(i), except that CMS calculates a single  overall (combined operating and capital) cost-to-charge ratio and  national averages that will be used instead of statewide averages.  Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2003,  additional payments made under this section will also be subject to  adjustments at Sec. 412.84(m), except that CMS calculates a single  overall (combined operating and capital) cost-to-charge ratio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Adjustments related to the patient assessment instrument. An  adjustment to a facility's Federal prospective payment amount for a  given discharge will be made, as specified under Sec. 412.614(d), if  the transmission of data from a patient assessment instrument is late.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Adjustments for certain facilities geographically redesignated  in FY 2006--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General. For a facility defined as an urban facility  under Sec. 412.602 in FY 2006 that was previously defined as a rural  facility in FY 2005 as the term rural was defined in FY 2005 under Sec.  412.602 and whose payment, after applying the adjustment under this  paragraph, will be lower only because of being defined as an urban  facility in FY 2006 and it no longer qualified for the rural adjustment  under Sec. 412.624(e)(3) in FY 2006, CMS will adjust the facility's  payment using the following method:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2005, and on or  before September 30, 2006, the facility's payment will be increased by  an adjustment of two thirds of its prior FY 2005 19.14 percent rural  adjustment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2006, and on or  before September 30, 2007, the facility's payment will be increased by  an adjustment of one third of its FY 2005 19.14 percent rural  adjustment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2005  and on or before September 30, 2007, facilities whose payments, after  applying the adjustment under this paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section,  will be higher because of being defined as an urban facility in FY 2006  and no longer being qualified for the rural adjustment under Sec.  412.624(e)(3) in FY 2006, CMS will adjust the facility's payment by a  portion of the applicable additional adjustment   described in paragraph (e)(7)(i)(A) and (e)(7)(i)(B) of this section as  determined by us.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special payment provision for patients that are transferred. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  A facility's Federal prospective payment will be adjusted to account for  a discharge of a patient who--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is transferred from the inpatient rehabilitation facility to  another site of care, as defined in Sec. 412.602; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Stays in the facility for a number of days that is less than  the average length of stay for nontransfer cases in the case-mix group  to which the patient is classified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We calculate the adjusted Federal prospective payment for  patients who are transferred in the following manner:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By dividing the Federal prospective payment by the average  length of stay for nontransfer cases in the case-mix group to which the  patient is classified to equal the payment per day.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By multiplying the payment per day under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of  this section by the number of days the patient stayed in the facility  prior to being discharged to equal the per day payment amount.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> By multiplying the payment per day under paragraph (f)(2)(i)  by 0.5 to equal an additional one half day payment for the first day of  the stay before the discharge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> By adding the per day payment amount under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)  and the additional one-half day payment under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) to  equal the unadjusted payment amount.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> By applying the adjustment described in paragraphs (e)(1),  (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4), and (e)(7) of this section to the unadjusted  payment amount determined in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section to  equal the adjusted transfer payment amount and making a payment in  accordance with paragraph (e)(5) of this section, if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Special payment provision for interrupted stays. When a patient  in an inpatient rehabilitation facility has one or more interruptions in  the stay, as defined in Sec. 412.602 and as indicated on the patient  assessment instrument in accordance with Sec. 412.618(b), we will make  payments in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>. Payment  for a patient who is discharged and returns to the same inpatient  rehabilitation facility on the same day will only be made to the  inpatient rehabilitation facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Patient is discharged and does not return by the end of the same  day. Payment for a patient who is discharged and does not return on the  same day but does return to the same inpatient rehabilitation facility  by or on midnight of the third day, defined as an interrupted stay under  Sec. 412.602, will be--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The adjusted Federal prospective payment under paragraph (e) of  this section that is based on the patient assessment data specified in  Sec. 412.618(a)(1) made to the inpatient rehabilitation facility; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the reason for the interrupted patient stay is to receive  inpatient acute care hospital services, an amount based on the  prospective payment systems described in Sec. 412.1(a)(1) made to the  acute care hospital.
