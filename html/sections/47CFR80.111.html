                            <p class="depth0">This section applies to all coast stations using telephony which are  subject to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Limitations on calling. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except when transmitting a general  call to all stations for announcing or preceding the transmission of  distress, urgency, or safety messages, a coast station must call the  particular station(s) with which it intends to communicate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Coast stations must call ship stations by voice unless it is  known that the particular ship station may be contacted by other means  such as automatic actuation of a selective ringing or calling device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Coast stations may be authorized emission for selective calling  on each working frequency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Calling a particular station must not continue for more than one  minute in each instance. If the called station does not reply, that  station must not again be called for two minutes. When a called station  does not reply to a call sent three times at intervals of two minutes,  the calling must cease for fifteen minutes. However, if harmful  interference will not be caused to other communications in progress, the  call may be repeated after three minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A coast station must not attempt to communicate with a ship  station that has specifically called another coast station until it  becomes evident that the called station does not answer, or that  communication between the ship station and the called station cannot be  carried on because of unsatisfactory operating conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Calls to establish communication must be initiated on an  available common working frequency when such a frequency exists and it  is known that the called ship maintains a simultaneous watch on the  common working frequency and the appropriate calling frequency(ies).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time limitation on calling frequency. Transmissions by coast  stations on 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz must be minimized and any one  exchange of communications must not exceed one minute in duration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Change to working frequency. After establishing communications  with another station by call and reply on 2182 kHz or 156.800 MHz coast  stations must change to an authorized working channel for the  transmission of messages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of busy signal. A coast station, when communicating with a  ship station which transmits to the coast station on a radio channel  which is a different channel from that used by the coast station for  transmission, may transmit a ``busy'' signal whenever   transmission from the ship station is being received. The  characteristics of the ``busy'' signal are contained in Sec. 80.74.  [51 FR 31213, Sept. 2, 1986, as amended at 52 FR 35244, Sept. 18, 1987]</p><p class="depth2">Operating Procedures--Ship Stations</p>
