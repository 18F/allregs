                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a registration statement purports to register securities to be offered pursuant to terms which provide for a change in the amount of securities being offered or issued to prevent dilution resulting from stock splits, stock dividends, or similar transactions, such registration statement shall, unless otherwise expressly provided, be deemed to cover the additional securities to be offered or issued in connection with any such provision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If prior to completion of the distribution of the securities covered by a registration statement, additional securities of the same class are issued or issuable as a result of a stock split or stock dividend, the registration statement shall, unless otherwise expressly provided therein, be deemed to cover such additional securities resulting from the split of, or the stock dividend on, the registered securities. If prior to completion of the distribution of the securities covered by a registration statement, all the securities of a class which includes the registered securities are combined by a reverse split into a lesser amount of securities of the same class, the amount of undistributed securities of such class deemed to be covered by the registration statement shall be proportionately reduced. If paragraph (a) of this section is not applicable, the registration statement shall be amended prior to the offering of such additional or lesser amount of securities to reflect the change in the amount of securities registered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a registration statement on Form S-8 relates to securities to be offered pursuant to an employee benefit plan, including interests in such plan that constitute separate securities required to be registered under the Act, such registration statement shall be deemed to register an indeterminate amount of such plan interests.
