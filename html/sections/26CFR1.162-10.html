                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>. In such an event, the extent to which these amounts are  deductible from gross income shall be governed by the provisions of  section 404 and the regulations issued thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certain negotiated plans. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to the limitations set  forth in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, contributions paid  by an employer under a plan under which such contributions are held in a  welfare trust for the purpose of paying (either from principal or income  or both) for the benefit of employees, their families, and dependents,  at least medical or hospital care, and pensions on retirement or death  of employees, are deductible when paid as business expenses under  section 162(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the word  ``plan'' means any plan established prior to January 1, 1954, as a  result of an agreement between employee representatives and the  Government of the United States, during a period of Government  operation, under seizure powers, of a major part of the productive  facilities of the industry in which the employer claiming the deduction  is engaged. The phrase ``plan established prior to January 1, 1954, as a  result of an agreement'' is intended primarily to cover a trust  established under the terms of such an agreement. It also includes a  trust established under a plan of an employer, or group of employers,  who, by reason of producing the same commodity, are in competition with  the employers whose facilities were seized and who would therefore be  expected to establish such a trust as a reasonable measure to maintain a  sound position in the labor market producing the commodity. For example,  if a trust was established under such an agreement in the bituminous  coal industry, a similar trust established in the anthracite coal  industry within a reasonable time, but before January 1, 1954, would  qualify under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If any trust described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph  becomes qualified for exemption from tax under the provisions of section  501(a), the deductibility of contributions by an employer to such trust  on or after any date of such qualification shall no longer be governed  by the provisions of section 162, even though the trust may later lose  its exemption from tax under section 501(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other plans providing deferred compensation. For rules relating  to the deduction of amounts paid to or under a stock bonus, pension,  annuity, or profit-sharing plan or amounts paid or accrued under any  other plan deferring   the receipt of compensation, see section 404 and the regulations  thereunder.    Sec. 1.162-10T  Questions and answers relating to the deduction of employee benefits under the Tax Reform Act of 1984; certain limits on amounts deductible (temporary).</p><p class="depth2">Q-1: How does the amendment of section 404(b) by the Tax Reform Act  of 1984 affect the deduction of employee benefits under section 162 of  the Internal Revenue Code?</p><p class="depth2">A-1: As amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1984, section 404(b)  clarifies that section 404(a) and (d) (in the case of employees and  nonemployees, respectively) shall govern the deduction of contributions  paid or compensation paid or incurred under a plan, or method or  arrangement, deferring the receipt of compensation or providing for  deferred benefits. Section 404(a) and (d) requires that such a  contribution or compensation be paid or incurred for purposes of section  162 or 212 and satisfy the requirements for deductibility under either  of these sections. However, notwithstanding the above, section 404 does  not apply to contributions paid or accrued with respect to a ``welfare  benefit fund'' (as defined in section 419(e)) after July 18, 1984, in  taxable years of employers (and payors) ending after that date.</p><p class="depth2">Also, section 463 shall govern the deduction of vacation pay by a  taxpayer that has elected the application of such section. Section  404(b), as amended, generally applies to contributions paid and  compensation paid or incurred after July 18, 1984, in taxable years of  employers (and payors) ending after that date. See Q&A-3; of Sec.  1.404(b)-1T. For rules relating to the deduction of contributions  attributable to the provision of deferred benefits, see section 404 (a),  (b) and (d) and Sec. 1.404(a)-1T, Sec. 1.404(b)-1T and Sec. 1.404(d)- 1T. For rules relating to the deduction of contributions paid or accrued  with respect to a welfare benefit fund, see section 419, Sec. 1.419-1T  and Sec. 1.419A-2T. For rules relating to the deduction of vacation pay  for which an election is made under section 463, see Sec. 301.9100-16T  of this chapter and Sec. 1.463-1T.</p><p class="depth2">Q-2: How does the enactment of section 419 by the Tax Reform Act of  1984 affect the deduction of employee benefits under section 162?</p><p class="depth2">A-2: As enacted by the Tax Reform Act of 1984, section 419 shall  govern the deduction of contributions paid or accrued by an employer (or  a person receiving services under section 419(g)) with respect to a  ``welfare benefit fund'' (within the meaning of section 419(e)) after  December 31, 1985, in taxable years of the employer (or person receiving  the services) ending after that date. Section 419(a) requires that such  a contribution be paid or accrued for purposes of section 162 or 212 and  satisfy the requirements for deductibility under either of those  sections. Generally, subject to a binding contract exception (as  described in section 511(e)(5) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984), section  419 shall also govern the deduction of the contribution of a facility  (or other contribution used to acquire or improve a facility) to a  welfare benefit fund after June 22, 1984. See Q&A-11; of Sec. 1.419-1T.  In the case of a welfare benefit fund maintained pursuant to a  collective bargaining agreement, section 419 applies to the extent  provided under the special effective date rule described in Q&A-2; of  Sec. 1.419-1T and the special rules of Sec. 1.419A-2T. For rules  relating to the deduction of contributions paid or accrued with respect  to a welfare benefit fund, see section 419 and Sec. 1.419-1T.
