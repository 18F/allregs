                            <p class="depth0">Engine and vessel manufacturers, as well as owners, operators, and  rebuilders of engines and vessels subject to the requirements of this  part, and all other persons, must observe the provisions of this part,  the requirements and prohibitions in 40 CFR part 1068, and the  provisions of the Clean Air Act. The provisions of 40 CFR part 1068  apply for compression-ignition marine engines as specified in that part,  subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following prohibitions apply with respect to recreational  marine engines and recreational vessels:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a vessel with an engine that is certified and labeled as a  recreational marine engine, using it in a manner inconsistent with its  intended use as a recreational vessel violates 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1),  except as allowed by this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subpart I of this part describes how the prohibitions of 40 CFR  1068.101(a)(1) apply for certain remanufactured engines. The provisions  of 40 CFR 1068.105 do not allow the installation of a new remanufactured  engine in a vessel that is defined as a new vessel unless the  remanufactured engine is subject to the same standards as the standards  applicable to freshly manufactured engines of the required model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The provisions of 40 CFR 1068.120 apply when rebuilding marine  engines, except as specified in subpart I of this part. The following  additional requirements also apply when rebuilding marine engines  equipped with exhaust aftertreatment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Follow all instructions from the engine manufacturer and  aftertreatment manufacturer for checking, repairing, and replacing  aftertreatment components. For example, you must replace the catalyst if  the catalyst assembly is stamped with a build date more than ten years  ago and the manufacturer's instructions state that catalysts over ten  years old must be replaced when the engine is rebuilt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Measure pressure drop across the catalyst assembly to ensure  that it is neither higher nor lower than the manufacturer's  specifications and repair or replace exhaust-system components as needed  to bring the pressure drop within the manufacturer's specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For engines equipped with exhaust sensors, verify that sensor  outputs are within the manufacturer's recommended range and repair or  replace any malfunctioning components (sensors, catalysts, or other  components).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The provisions of Sec.  1042.635 for the national security  exemption apply instead of 40 CFR 1068.225.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For replacement engines, apply the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.240  as described in Sec.  1042.615.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For the purpose of meeting the defect-reporting requirements in  40 CFR 1068.501, if you manufacture other nonroad engines that are  substantially similar to your marine engines, you may consider defects  using combined marine and non-marine families.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The selective enforcement audit provisions of 40 CFR part 1068  do not apply for Category 3 engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The defect reporting requirements of 40 CFR 1068.501 apply for  Category 3 engines, except the threshold for filing a defect report is  two engines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You may not circumvent the requirements of this part or the  Clean Air Act by manufacturing a vessel outside the United States or  initially flagging a vessel in another country. The definition of ``new  marine engine'' in Sec.  1042.901 includes provisions for U.S.-flagged  vessels that are manufactured or reflagged outside of U.S. waters. These  provisions have the effect of applying the prohibitions of 40 CFR  1068.101(a)(1) to such vessels no later than when they first enter U.S.  waters. The inclusion of these provisions does not affect requirements  or prohibitions of the Clean Air Act or other statutes that may apply to  the vessel before it first enters U.S. waters.
