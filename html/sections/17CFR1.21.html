                            <p class="depth0">All money received directly or indirectly by, and all money and  equities accruing to, a futures commission merchant from any derivatives  clearing organization or from any clearing member or from any member of  a contract market incident to or resulting from any trade, contract or  commodity option made by or through such futures commission merchant on  behalf of any futures customer shall be considered as accruing to such  futures customer within the meaning of the Act and these regulations.  Such money and equities shall be treated and dealt with as belonging to  such futures customer in accordance with the provisions of the Act and  these regulations. Money and equities accruing in connection with  futures customers' open trades, contracts, or commodity options need not  be separately credited to individual accounts but may be treated and  dealt with as belonging undivided to all futures customers having open  trades, contracts, or commodity option positions which if closed would  result in a credit to such futures customers.
