Sec.  1.300 through 1.303 apply to VA medical facility parking facilities in the United States, its territories and possessions, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and to such parking facilities for the use of VA medical facilities jointly shared by VA and another Federal agency when the facility is operated by the VA. Sections 1.300 through 1.303 apply to all users of those parking facilities. Fees shall be assessed and collected at medical facilities where parking garages are constructed, acquired, or altered at a cost exceeding $500,000 (or, in the case of acquisition by lease, $100,000 per year). The Secretary, in the exercise of official discretion, may also determine that parking fees shall be charged at any other VA medical facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All fees established shall be reasonable under the circumstances and shall cover all parking facilities used in connection with such VA medical facility.
