                            <p class="depth0">In this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations  (EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This part describes all the reasons for control reflected  in the Country Chart in Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR. In  addition, it includes licensing requirements and licensing policies for  the following items that are not reflected on the Country Chart:  specially designed implements of torture, high performance computers,  and communications intercepting devices. In addition to describing the  reasons for control and licensing requirements and policies, this part  describes any applicable contract sanctity provisions that may apply to  specific controls and includes a description of any multilateral regime  under which specific controls are maintained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reasons for control listed on the CCL not covered by this part.  This part describes the license requirements and the licensing policies  for all the ``Reasons for Control'' that are listed on the Commerce  Control List (CCL) except ``Short Supply'' and ``U.N. Sanctions,'' which  do not appear on the Country Chart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Short supply. ECCNs containing items subject to short supply  controls (``SS'') refer the exporter to part 754 of the EAR. These ECCNs  are: 0A980 (Horses for export by sea); 1C980 (certain inorganic  chemicals); 1C981 (Crude petroleum, including reconstituted crude  petroleum, tar sands, and crude shale oil); 1C982 (certain other  petroleum products); 1C983 (certain natural gas liquids and other  natural gas derivatives); 1C984 (certain manufactured gas and synthetic  natural gas (except when commingled with natural gas and thus subject to  export authorization from the Department of Energy); and 1C988  (Unprocessed western red cedar (thuja plicata) logs and timber, and  rough, dressed and worked lumber containing wane).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> U.N. Sanctions. The United Nations imposes sanctions, short of  complete embargoes, against certain countries which may result in  controls that supplement those otherwise maintained under the EAR for  that particular country. This part does not address license requirements  and licensing policies for controls implementing U.N. sanctions. CCL  entries containing items subject to U.N. sanctions will refer the  exporter to part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls,  for any supplemental controls that may apply to exports and reexports  involving these countries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exports and reexports involving Cuba and Iran. This part does  not cover license requirements and licensing policies that apply to  exports and reexports to embargoed destinations (Cuba and Iran). These  comprehensive embargoes cover a broader range of items than those  reflected in the CCL. If you are exporting or reexporting to any of  these destinations, you should first review part 746 of the EAR,  Embargoes and Other Special Controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Anti-terrorism Controls on Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and  Syria. Commerce maintains anti-terrorism controls on Cuba, Iran, North  Korea, Syria and Sudan under section 6(a) of the Export Administration  Act. Items controlled under section 6(a) to Iran, Syria, Sudan, and  North Korea are described in Sec. Sec. 742.8, 742.9, 742.10, and  742.19, respectively, and in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. Commerce also  maintains controls under section 6(j) of the EAA to Cuba, Iran, North  Korea, Sudan and Syria. Items controlled to these countries under EAA  section 6(j) are also described in Supplement 2 to part 742. The  Secretaries of Commerce and State are required to notify appropriate  Committees of the Congress 30 days before issuing a license for an item  controlled under section 6(j) to Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Sudan or  Syria. If you are exporting or reexporting to Cuba, Iran, North Korea,  or Syria, you should review part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other  Special Controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> End-user and end-use based controls. This part does not cover  prohibitions and licensing requirements for exports of items not  included on the CCL that are subject to end-use and end-user controls:  certain nuclear end-uses; certain missile end-uses; certain chemical and  biological weapons end-uses; certain naval nuclear propulsion end-uses;  certain activities of U.S. persons; and certain exports to and for the  use of certain foreign vessels and aircraft. Licensing requirements and  policies for these exports are contained in part 744 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Overlapping license policies. Many items on the CCL are subject  to more than one type of control (e.g., national security (NS), missile  technology (MT), nuclear nonproliferation (NP), regional stability  (RS)). In addition, applications for all items on the CCL, other than  those controlled for short supply reasons, may be reviewed for missile  technology (see Sec. 742.5(b)(3) of this part), nuclear  nonproliferation (see Sec. 742.3(b)(2) of this part), or chemical and  biological weapons (see Sec. 742.2(b)(3) of this part), if the end-use  or end-user may be involved in certain proliferation activities.  Finally, many multilaterally controlled items are reviewed for anti- terrorism reasons if they are destined for a terrorism-supporting  country (see paragraph (d) of this section). Your application for a  license will be reviewed under all applicable licensing policies. A  license will be issued only if an application can be approved under all  applicable licensing policies.
