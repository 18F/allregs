However, when there is reason to (1) question the reliability or accuracy of the contractor's certification or (2) believe that the contract will involve a loss, the ACO should ask for a review or audit of the request before payment is approved or the request is otherwise disposed of.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When there is reason to doubt the amount of a progress payment request, only the doubtful amount should be withheld, subject to later adjustment after review or audit; any clearly proper and due amounts should be paid without awaiting resolution of the differences.</p>
