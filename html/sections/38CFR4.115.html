                            <p class="depth0">Albuminuria alone is not nephritis, nor will the presence of  transient albumin and casts following acute febrile illness be taken as  nephritis. The glomerular type of nephritis is usually preceded by or  associated with severe infectious disease; the onset is sudden, and the  course marked by red blood cells, salt retention, and edema; it may  clear up entirely or progress to a chronic condition. The  nephrosclerotic type, originating in hypertension or arteriosclerosis,  develops slowly, with minimum laboratory findings, and is associated  with natural progress. Separate ratings are not to be assigned for  disability from disease of the heart and any form of nephritis, on  account of the close interrelationships of cardiovascular disabilities.  If, however, absence of a kidney is the sole renal disability, even if  removal was required because of nephritis, the absent kidney and any  hypertension or heart disease will be separately rated. Also, in the  event that chronic renal disease has progressed to the point where  regular dialysis is required, any coexisting hypertension or heart  disease will be separately rated.
