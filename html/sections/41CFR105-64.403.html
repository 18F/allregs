                            <p class="depth0">The system manager will consult with the Head of Service or Staff  Office or Regional Administrator or their representatives, and legal  counsel. They will determine whether to amend an existing record by  comparing its accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness with the  amendment you propose. The system manager will notify you within 10  workdays whether your proposed amendment is approved or denied. In case  of an expected delay, the system manager will acknowledge receipt of  your request in writing and provide an estimate of when you may expect a  decision. If your request to amend is approved, the system manager will  amend the record and send an amended copy to you and to anyone who had  previously received the record. If your request to amend is denied, the  system manager will advise you in writing, giving the reason for denial,  a proposed alternative amendment if possible, and your appeal rights.  The system manager also will notify the GSA Privacy Act Officer of any  request for amendment and its disposition. Any amendment to a record may  involve a person's Official Personnel Folder (OPF). OPF regulations are  governed by OPM regulations, including alternate amendments and appeals  of denials, and not GSA regulations.</p>
