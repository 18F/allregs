                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of Sec. 519.4 of this subpart, a notice  thereof shall be similarly posted during the effective period of such  authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Full-time students may not be employed under a certificate at  less than 85 percent of the minimum wage applicable under section 6 of  the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For retail or service establishment employers or agricultural  employers, the allowable extent of full-time student employment under  certificates varies depending on whether: (1) The employer proposes to  employ no more than six full-time students at subminimum wages on any  workday, (2) the applicant requests authority for not more than 10  percent of the total hours of all employees during any month, or (3) the  applicant requests authority for more than 10 percent of the total hours  during any month. (For agricultural employers, the month of full-time  student certificated employment may vary somewhat from the month in a  previous year on which the certificate is based, depending on seasonal  factors.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Retail or service establishment employers or agricultural  employers requesting authorization to employ not more than six full-time  students at subminimum wages on any workday. An application from such an  applicant provides temporary authorization for the employment of full- time students at subminimum wages: Provided, The conditions set forth in  paragraph (a) of Sec. 519.4 of this subpart are met. Upon review of the  application by the Administration or his/her authorized representative,  the extent of the temporary authority may be modified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applicants requesting authorization for not more than 10 percent  of the total hours of all employees during any month. For such an  applicant, certificates may authorize the employment of full-time  student at subminimum wages for up to 10 percent of the total hours of  all employees during any month, regardless of past practice of employing  students. (Note: An establishment which has not previously held a  certificate may be authorized 10 percent of the total hours of all  employees during any month. Applicants requesting authority under this  paragraph need not refer to paragraphs (f), (g), or (h) of this  section.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Applicants requesting authorization for more than 10 percent of  the total monthly hours of all employees during any month with records  of hours of employment of students and coverage by the Act prior to May  1974. For such an applicant, certificates may not authorize full-time  student employment at subminimum wages in excess of the highest ratio  under any of these three formulas: (1) The proportion of student hours  of employment (i.e., of full-time students under certificates) to total  hours of all employees for the corresponding month of the preceding  twelve-month period; (2) the maximum proportion of student hours of  employment to total hours of all employees (in any corresponding month),  applicable to the issuance of full-time student certificates before May  1974; or (3) 10 percent of the total hours of all employees, during any  month. (Note: An establishment which is entitled to monthly allowances  ranging from 5 to 20 percent may be authorized 10 percent for those  months which were less than 10 percent and retain the higher allowances  for those months above 10 percent.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Applicants requesting authorization for more than 10 percent of  the total hours of all employees during any month with records of hours  of employment of students and new coverage under the 1974 Amendments.  For such an applicant, the highest permissible allowance under a  certificate during any month is the highest ratio under any of these  three formulas:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proportion of hours of employment of full-time students to  total hours of all employees during the corresponding month from May  1973 through April 1974;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The proportion of student hours of employment (i.e., of hours of  full-time students under certificates) to total hours of all employees  during the corresponding month of the preceding twelve-month period (an  alternative which is not applicable to all months of the year until 12  months after May 1, 1974); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 10 percent of the total hours of all employees, during any  month. (See notes under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Applicants requesting authorization for more than 10 percent of  the total hours of all employees during any month without records of  student hours worked. For such an applicant, the permissible proportion  under certificate of full-time student hours at subminimum wages to  total hours of all employees is based on the ``practice'' during the  preceding twelve-month period of: (1) Similar establishments of the same  employer in the same general metropolitan areas in which such  establishment is located: (2) similar establishments in the same or  nearby communities if such establishment is not in a metropolitan area;  or (3) other establishments of the same general character operating in  the community or the nearest comparable community. (``Practice'' means  either the certificate allowances or the proportion between the actual  student hours of employment to the total hours of all employees.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> An overestimate of total hours of employment of all employees  for a current month resulting in the employment of the full-time  students in excess of the hours authorized in paragraph (e), (f), (g),  or (h) of this section may be corrected by compensating them for the  difference between the subminimum wages actually paid and the applicable  minimum under section 6 of the Act for the excess hours. Similarly, if  an agricultural employer or a retail or service establishment employer  has authorization to employ no more than six full-time students at  subminimum wages on any workday but exceeds that number, the excess may  be corrected by compensating the additional full-time students for the  difference between the subminimum wages actually paid and the applicable  minimum under section 6 of the Act. This additional compensation shall  be paid on the regular payday next after the end of the period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Full-time students shall not be permitted to work at subminimum  wages for more than 8 hours a day, nor for more than 40 hours a week  when school is not in session, nor more than 20 hours a week when school  is in session (apart from a full-time student's summer vacation), except  that when a full-day school holiday occurs on a day when the  establishment is open for   business, the weekly limitation on the maximum number of hours which may  be worked shall be increased by 8 hours for each such holiday but in no  event shall the 40-hour limitation be exceeded. (Note: School is  considered to be in session for a student attending summer school.)  Whenever a full-time student is employed for more than 20 hours in any  workweek in conformance with this paragraph, the employer shall note in  his/her payroll records that school was not in session during all or  part of that workweek or the student was in his/her summer vacation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Neither oppressive child labor as defined in section 3(1) of the  Act and regulations issued under the Act nor any other employment in  violation of a Federal, State or local child labor law or ordinance  shall come within the terms of any certificate issued under this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Full-time students shall be employed at subminimum wages under  this subpart only outside of their school hours, i.e., only outside of  the scheduled hours of instruction of the individual student, or, in the  case of agriculture, only outside of school hours for the school  district where the employee is living while so employed, if the employee  is under 16 years of age.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> No full-time student shall be hired under a full-time student  certificate while abnormal labor conditions, such as a strike or  lockout, exist at the establishment or farm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> No provision of any full-time student certificate shall excuse  noncompliance with higher standards applicable to full-time students  which may be established under the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act or  any other Federal law, State law, local ordinance, or union or other  agreement. Thus, certificates issued under this law have no application  to employment under the Service Contract Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> No full-time student certificate shall apply to any employee to  whom a certificate issued under section 14 (a) or (c) of the Act has  application.  [40 FR 6329, Feb. 11, 1975; 40 FR 22546, May 23, 1975, as amended at 42  FR 58745, Nov. 11, 1977]</p>
