                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Expected return for but one life. (1) If a contract to which  section 72 applies provides that one annuitant is to receive a fixed  monthly income for life, the expected return is determined by  multiplying the total of the annuity payments to be received annually by  the multiple shown in Table I or V (whichever is applicable) of Sec.  1.72-9 under the age (as of the annuity starting date) and, if  applicable, sex of the measuring life (usually the annuitant's). Thus,  where a male purchases a contract before July 1, 1986, providing for an  immediate annuity of $100 per month for his life and, as of the annuity  starting date (in this case the date of purchase), the annuitant's age  at his nearest birthday is 66, the expected return is computed as  follows:  Monthly payment of $100x12 months equals annual payment of....    $1,200 Multiple shown in Table I, male, age 66.......................      14.4</p><p class="depth0">--------- Expected return (1,200x14.4)..................................    17,280</p><p class="depth0">If, however, the taxpayer had purchased the contract after June 30,  1986, the expected return would be $23,040, determined by multiplying  19.2 (multiple shown in Table V, age 66) by $1,200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If payments are to be made quarterly, semiannually, or  annually, an adjustment of the applicable multiple shown in Table I or V  (whichever is applicable) may be required. A further adjustment may be  required where the interval between the annuity starting date and the  date of the first payment is less than the interval between future  payments. Neither adjustment shall be made, however, if the payments are  to be made more frequently than quarterly. The amount of the adjustment,  if any, is to be found in accordance with the following table:  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">If the number of whole months from the annuity starting</p><p class="depth0">date to the first payment date is--             0-1     2      3      4      5      6       7        8        9        10       11       12 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And the payments under the contract are to be made:</p><p class="depth0">Annually............................................   +0.5   +0.4   +0.3   +0.2   +0.1      0        0     -0.1     -0.2     -0.3     -0.4     -0.5</p><p class="depth0">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Semiannually........................................    +.2    +.1      0      0    -.1    -.2</p><p class="depth0">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Quarterly...........................................    +.1      0    -.1  .....  .....  .....  .......  .......  .......  .......  .......  ....... --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Thus, for a male, age 66, the multiple found in Table I, adjusted for  quarterly payments the first of which is to be made one full month after  the annuity starting date, is 14.5 (14.4+0.1); for semiannual payments  the first of which is to be made six full months from the annuity  starting date, the adjusted multiple is 14.2 (14.4-0.2); for annual  payments the first of which is to be made one full month from the  annuity starting date, the adjusted multiple is 14.9 (14.4+0.5). If the  annuitant in the example shown in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  were to receive an annual payment of $1,200 commencing 12 full months  after his annuity starting date, the amount of the expected return would  be $16,680 ($1,200x13.9 [14.4-0.5]). Similarly, for an annuitant, age  50, the multiple found in Table V, adjusted for quarterly payments the  first of which is to be made one full month after the annuity starting  date, is 33.2 (33.1+0.1); for semiannual payments the first of which is  to be made six full months from the annuity starting date, the adjusted  multiple is 32.9 (33.1-0.2); for annual payments the first of which is  to be made one full month from the annuity starting date, the adjusted  multiple is 33.6 (33.1+0.5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notwithstanding the table in subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph, adjustments of multiples for early or other than monthly  payments determined prior to February 19, 1956, under the table  prescribed in paragraph 1(b)(4) of T.D. 6118 (19 FR 9897, C.B. 1955-1,  699), approved December 30, 1954, need not be redetermined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the contract provides for fixed payments to be made to an  annuitant until death or until the expiration of a specified limited  period, whichever occurs earlier, the expected return of such temporary  life annuity is determined by multiplying the total of the annuity  payments to be received annually by the multiple shown in Table IV or  VIII (whichever is applicable) of Sec. 1.72-9 for the age (as of the  annuity starting date) and, if applicable, sex of the annuitant and the  nearest whole number of years in the specified period. For example, if a  male annuitant, age 60 (at his nearest birthday), is to receive $60 per  month for five years or until he dies, whichever is earlier, and there  is no post-June 1986, investment in the contract, the expected return  under such a contract is $3,456, computed as follows:  Monthly payments of $60x12 months equals annual payment of....      $720 Multiple shown in Table IV for male, age 60, for term of 5           4.8</p><p class="depth0">years........................................................</p><p class="depth0">--------- Expected return for 5 year temporary life annuity of $720 per     $3,456</p><p class="depth0">year ($720x4.8)..............................................</p><p class="depth0">If the annuitant purchased the same contract after June 30, 1986, the  expected return under the contract would be $3,528, computed as follows:  Monthly payments of $60x12 months equals annual payment          $720.00</p><p class="depth0">of....................................................</p><p class="depth0">Multiple shown in Table VIII for annuitant, age 60, for              4.9</p><p class="depth0">term of 5 years.......................................</p><p class="depth0">---------------- Expected return for 5-year temporary life annuity of           $3,528.00</p><p class="depth0">$720 per year ($720x4.9)..............................</p><p class="depth0">The adjustment provided by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall not  be made with respect to the multiple found in Table IV or VIII  (whichever is applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the contract provides for payments to be made to an annuitant  for the annuitant's lifetime, but the amount of the annual payments is  to be decreased after the expiration of a specified limited period, the  expected return is computed by considering the contract as a combination  of a whole life annuity for the smaller amount plus a temporary life  annuity for an amount equal to the difference between the larger and the  smaller amount. For example, if a male annuitant, age 60, is to receive  $150 per month for five years or until his earlier death, and is to  receive $90 per month for the remainder of his lifetime after such five  years, the expected return is computed as if the annuitant's contract  consisted of a whole life annuity for $90 per month plus a five year  temporary life annuity of $60 per month. In such circumstances, the  expected return if there is no post-June 1986 investment in the contract  is computed as follows:  Monthly payments of $90x12 months equals annual payment           $1,080</p><p class="depth0">of....................................................

Thus, if the annuitant  described in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph were to receive $90 per  month for five years or until his earlier death, and to receive $150 per  month for the remainder of his lifetime after such five years, the  expected return would be computed by subtracting the expected return  under a five year temporary life annuity of $60 per month from the  expected return under a whole life annuity of $150 per month. In such  circumstances, the expected return if there is no post-June 1986  investment in the contract is computed as follows:  Monthly payments of $150x12 months equals annual                  $1,800</p><p class="depth0">payment of............................................

(1) In the case of a joint and survivor annuity contract involving two  annuitants which provides the first annuitant with a fixed monthly  income for life and, after the death of the first annuitant, provides an  identical monthly income for life to a second annuitant, the expected  return shall be determined by multiplying the total amount of the  payments to be received annually by the multiple obtained from Table II  or VI (whichever is applicable) of Sec. 1.72-9 under the ages (as of  the annuity starting date) and, if applicable, sexes of the living  annuitants. For example, a husband purchases a joint and survivor  annuity contract providing for payments of $100 per month for life and,  after his death, for the same amount to his wife for the remainder of  her life. As of the annuity starting date his age at his nearest  birthday is 70 and that of his wife at her nearest birthday is 67. If  there is no post-June 1986 investment in the contract, the expected  return is computed as follows:  Monthly payments of $100x12 months equals annual                  $1,200</p><p class="depth0">payment of............................................

The multiple applicable to the first  annuitant is then found in Table I or V (whichever is applicable) as  though the contract were for a single life annuity. The multiple from  Table I or V is then subtracted from the multiple obtained from Table II  or VI and the resulting multiple is applied to the total payments to be  received annually under the contract by the second annuitant. The result  is the expected return with respect to the second annuitant. The portion  of the expected return with respect to payments to be made during the  first annuitant's life is then computed by applying the multiple found  in Table I or V to the total annual payments to be received by such  annuitant under the contract.

Thus, if the investment in the  contract in this example is $14,310, the exclusion ratio is $14,310/ $19,080; or 75 percent. The amount excludable from each monthly payment  made to the husband is 75 percent of $100, or $75, and the remaining $25  of each payment received by him shall be included in his gross income.  After the husband's death, the amount excludable   by the second annuitant (the surviving wife) would be 75 percent of each  monthly payment of $50, or $37.50, and the remaining $12.50 of each  payment shall be included in her gross income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

After his death, his wife would  exclude 62.8 percent, or $31.40, of each $50 monthly payment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. If amounts were invested in the same contract both before  July 1, 1986, and after June 30, 1986, and the election described in  Sec. 1.72-6(d)(6) were made, two exclusion ratios would be determined  pursuant to Sec. 1.72-6(d). Assume that the husband's total investment  in the contract is $14,310 and that $7,310 is the pre-July 1986  investment in the contract. The pre-July 1986 exclusion ratio would be  $7,310/$19,080, or 38.3 percent. The post-June 1986 exclusion ratio  would be $7,000/$22,800, or 30.7 percent. The husband would exclude  $69.00 ($38.30+$30.70) of the $100 monthly payment received by him. The  remaining $31.00 would be included in his gross income. After the  husband's death, the amount excludable by his wife would be $34.50 (38.3  percent of $50 plus 30.7 percent of $50). The remaining $15.50 would be  included in gross income.   The same method is used if the payments are to be increased after the  death of the first annuitant. Thus, if the payments to be made until the  husband's death were $50 per month and his widow were to receive $100  per month thereafter until her death, the 7.6 multiple in example (1)  above would be applied to the $100 payments, yielding an expected return  with respect to this portion of the annuity contract of $9,120  ($1,200x7.6). An expected return of $7,260 ($600x12.1) would be obtained  with respect to the payments to be made to the husband, yielding a total  expected return under the contract of $16,380 ($9,120 plus $7,260). If  payments are to be made quarterly, semiannually, or annually, an  appropriate adjustment of the multiples found in Tables I and II or  Tables V and VI (whichever are applicable) should be made in accordance  with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a joint and survivor annuity contract in respect  of which the first annuitant died in 1951, 1952, or 1953, and the basis  of the surviving annuitant's interest in the contract was determinable  under section 113(a)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, such basis  shall be considered the ``aggregate of premiums or other consideration  paid'' by the surviving annuitant for the contract.

In determining such an annuitant's investment in the  contract, such aggregate shall be reduced by any amounts received under  the contract by the surviving annuitant before the annuity starting  date, to the extent such amounts were excludable from his gross income  at the time of receipt.

Assume that Taxpayer A in example (1) receives payments  for five years which are at least as large as the portion of the  investment in the contract allocable to such years, but in the sixth  year he receives a total of only $626.40 rather than the $955.20  allocable to such year. A is 69 and B is 61 at the beginning of the  first monthly period for which an amount is payable in the seventh  taxable year. A makes the election in that year provided under paragraph  (d)(3) of Sec. 1.72-4. The difference between the portion of the  investment in the contract allocable to the sixth year and the amount  actually received in that year is $328.80 ($955.20 less $626.40). In  this case, 139.2 unit payments are anticipatable (on an annual basis),  since the appropriate multiple from Table II of Sec. 1.72-9, 23.2,  multiplied by the number of units payable, in effect, as a joint and  survivor annuity yields this result (6x23.2). A's appropriate multiple  from Table I of Sec. 1.72-9 for the two units which will cease to be  paid at his death is 12.6, and the total number of unit payments  anticipatable (on an annual basis) is, therefore, 164.4 (2x12.6 plus  139.2). Dividing the difference previously found ($328.80) by the total  number of unit payments thus determined (164.4) indicates that A will  have an additional allocation of the investment in the contract of $16  to the seventh and every succeeding full taxable year (8 unitsx$2), and  B will have an additional allocation of the investment in the contract  of $12 (6 unitsx$2) to each taxable year in which she receives 12  monthly payments subsequent to the death of A. The total allocable to  each taxable year of A is, therefore, $971.20, and that allocable to  each taxable year of B will be $728.40.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. If, in example (2), A had died at the end of the fifth  year, in the sixth year B would have received a payment of $469.80 (that  portion of the $626.40 that A would have received which is in the same  ratio that 6   units bear to 8 units) and would thus have received $246.60 less than  the portion of the investment in the contract originally determined to  be allocable to each of her taxable years. In these circumstances, B  would be entitled to elect to redetermine the portion of the investment  in the contract allocable to the taxable year of election and all  subsequent years. The new amount allocable thereto would be found by  dividing the $246.60 difference by her life expectancy as of the first  day of the first period for which she received an amount as an annuity  in the seventh year of the annuity contract, and adding the result to  her originally determined allocation of $716.40.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4.

Assume that taxpayer C in example (4) receives payments  for four years which are at least as large as the portion of the  investment in the contract allocable to such years, but in the fifth  year receives a total of only $600 rather than the $1,037 allocable to  such year. C is 65 and D is 62 at the beginning of the first monthly  period for which an amount is payable in the sixth taxable year. C makes  the election in that year provided under paragraph (d)(3) of Sec. 1.72- 4. The difference between the portion of the investment in the contract  allocable to the fifth year and the amount actually received in that  year is $437 ($1,037-$600). In this case, 106 unit payments are  anticipatable with respect to the joint and survivor annuity element,  since the appropriate multiple from Table VI of Sec. 1.72-9, 26.5,  multiplied by the number of units payable, in effect, as a joint and  survivor annuity yields this result (4 x 26.0). C's appropriate multiple  from Table V of Sec. 1.72-9 for the six units which will cease to be  paid at C's death is 20.0, and the number of unit payments anticipatable  with respect to C alone is 120 (6 x 20). The total number of unit  payments anticipatable is, therefore, 226 (120 plus 106). Dividing the  difference previously found ($437) by the total number of unit payments  thus determined (226) indicates that C will have an additional  allocation of the investment in the contract of $19.30 to the sixth and  every succeeding full taxable year (10 units x $1.93), and D will have  an additional allocation of the investment in the contract of $7.72 (4  units x $1.93) to each taxable year in which D receives 12 monthly  payments subsequent to the death of C. The total allocable to each  taxable year of C is, therefore, $1,056.30, and that allocable to each  taxable year of D will be $422.52.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. If, in example (6), C had died at the end of the fourth  year, in the fifth year D would have received a payment of $240 (that  portion of the $600 that C would have received which is in the same  ratio that 4 units bear to 10 units) and would thus have received  $174.80 less than the portion of the investment in the contract  allocable to each of D's taxable years. In these circumstances, D would  be entitled to elect to redetermine the portion of the investment in the  contract allocable to the taxable year of election and all subsequent  years. The new amount allocable thereto would be found by dividing the  $174.80 difference by D's life expectancy as of the first day of the  first period for which D received an amount as an annuity in the sixth  year of the annuity contract, and adding the result to D's originally  determined allocation of $414.80.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Expected return for term certain. In the case of a contract  providing for specific periodic payments which are to be paid for a term  certain such as a fixed number of months or years, without regard to  life expectancy, the expected return is determined by multiplying the  fixed number of years or months for which payments are to be made on or  after the annuity starting date by the amount of the payment provided in  the contract for each such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Expected return with respect to amount certain. In the case of  contracts involving no life or lives as a measurement of their duration,  but under which a determinable total amount is to be paid in  installments of lesser amounts paid at periodic intervals, the expected  return shall be the total amount guaranteed. If an amount is to be paid  periodically until a fund plus interest at a fixed rate is exhausted,  but further payments may be made thereafter because of earnings at a  higher interest rate, this paragraph shall apply to the total amount  anticipatable as a result of the amount of the fund plus the fixed  interest thereon. Any amount which may be paid as the result of earnings  at a greater interest rate shall be disregarded in determining the  expected return. If such an amount is later received, it shall be  considered an amount not received as an annuity after the annuity  starting date.
