                                Sec. 105-60.403  Appeal within GSA.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A requester who receives a denial of a request, in whole or in  part, a denial of a request for expedited processing or of a fee waiver  request may appeal that decision within GSA. A requester may also appeal  the adequacy of the search if GSA determines that it has searched for  but has not requested records. The requester must send the appeal to the  GSA FOIA Officer, General Services Administration (CAI), Washington, DC  20405, regardless of whether the denial being appealed was made in the  Central Office or in a regional office. For denials which originate in  the Office of Inspector General, the requester must send the appeal to  the Inspector General, General Services Administration, 1800 F Street  NW., Washington, DC 20405.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The GSA FOIA Officer must receive an appeal no later than 120  calendar days after receipt by the requester of the initial denial of  access or fee waiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An appeal must be in writing and include a brief statement of  the reasons he or she thinks GSA should release the records or provide  expedited processing and enclose copies of the initial request and  denial. The appeal letter must include the words ``Freedom of  Information Act Appeal'' on both the face of the appeal letter and on  the envelope. Failure to follow these procedures will delay processing  of the appeal. GSA has 20 workdays after receipt of a proper appeal of  denial of records to issue a determination with respect to the appeal.  The 20-workday time limit shall not begin until the GSA FOIA Officer  receives the appeal. As noted in Sec. 105-60.404, the GSA FOIA Officer  may extend this time limit in   unusual circumstances. GSA will process appeals of denials of expedited  processing as soon as possible after receiving them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A requester who receives a denial of an appeal, or who has not  received a response to an appeal or initial request within the statutory  time frame may seek judicial review in the United States District Court  in the district in which the requester resides or has a principal place  of business, or where the records are situated, or in the United States  District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>
