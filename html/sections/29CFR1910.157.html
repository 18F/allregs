                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and application. The requirements of this section apply to  the placement, use, maintenance, and testing of portable fire  extinguishers provided for the use of employees. Paragraph (d) of this  section does not apply to extinguishers provided for employee use on the  outside of workplace buildings or structures. Where extinguishers are  provided but are not intended for employee use and the employer has an  emergency action plan and a fire prevention plan that meet the  requirements of 29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.39 respectively, then  only the requirements of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemptions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the employer has established and  implemented a written fire safety policy which requires the immediate  and total evacuation of employees from the workplace upon the sounding  of a fire alarm signal and which includes an emergency action plan and a  fire prevention plan which meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.38 and  29 CFR 1910.39 respectively, and when extinguishers are not available in  the workplace, the employer is exempt from all requirements of this  section unless a specific standard in part 1910 requires   that a portable fire extinguisher be provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the employer has an emergency action plan meeting the  requirements of Sec. 1910.38 which designates certain employees to be  the only employees authorized to use the available portable fire  extinguishers, and which requires all other employees in the fire area  to immediately evacuate the affected work area upon the sounding of the  fire alarm, the employer is exempt from the distribution requirements in  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer shall provide portable  fire extinguishers and shall mount, locate and identify them so that  they are readily accessible to employees without subjecting the  employees to possible injury.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Only approved portable fire extinguishers shall be used to meet  the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employer shall not provide or make available in the  workplace portable fire extinguishers using carbon tetrachloride or  chlorobromomethane extinguishing agents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The employer shall assure that portable fire extinguishers are  maintained in a fully charged and operable condition and kept in their  designated places at all times except during use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The employer shall remove from service all soldered or riveted  shell self-generating soda acid or self-generating foam or gas cartridge  water type portable fire extinguishers which are operated by inverting  the extinguisher to rupture the cartridge or to initiate an  uncontrollable pressure generating chemical reaction to expel the agent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Selection and distribution. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Portable fire extinguishers  shall be provided for employee use and selected and distributed based on  the classes of anticipated workplace fires and on the size and degree of  hazard which would affect their use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer shall distribute portable fire extinguishers for  use by employees on Class A fires so that the travel distance for  employees to any extinguisher is 75 feet (22.9 m) or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employer may use uniformly spaced standpipe systems or hose  stations connected to a sprinkler system installed for emergency use by  employees instead of Class A portable fire extinguishers, provided that  such systems meet the respective requirements of Sec. 1910.158 or  Sec. 1910.159, that they provide total coverage of the area to be  protected, and that employees are trained at least annually in their  use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The employer shall distribute portable fire extinguishers for  use by employees on Class B fires so that the travel distance from the  Class B hazard area to any extinguisher is 50 feet (15.2 m) or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The employer shall distribute portable fire extinguishers used  for Class C hazards on the basis of the appropriate pattern for the  existing Class A or Class B hazards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The employer shall distribute portable fire extinguishers or  other containers of Class D extinguishing agent for use by employees so  that the travel distance from the combustible metal working area to any  extinguishing agent is 75 feet (22.9 m) or less.
