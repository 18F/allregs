                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approval of grant. HUD will approve a grant if the jurisdiction's submissions have been made and approved in accordance with 24 CFR part 91, and the certifications required therein are satisfactory to the Secretary. The certifications will be satisfactory to the Secretary for this purpose unless the Secretary has determined pursuant to subpart O of this part that the grantee

has not complied with the requirements of this part, has failed to carry out its consolidated plan as provided under Sec. 570.903, or has determined that there is evidence, not directly involving the grantee's past performance under this program, that tends to challenge in a substantial manner the grantee's certification of future performance. If the Secretary makes any such determination, however, further assurances may be required to be submitted by the grantee as the Secretary may deem warranted or necessary to find the grantee's certification satisfactory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grant agreement. The grant will be made by means of a grant agreement executed by both HUD and the grantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Grant amount. The Secretary will make a grant in the full entitlement amount, generally within the last 30 days of the grantee's current program year, unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Either the consolidated plan is not received by August 16 of the federal fiscal year for which funds are appropriated or the consolidated plan is not approved under 24 CFR part 91, subpart F--in which case, the grantee will forfeit the entire entitlement amount; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The grantee's performance does not meet the performance requirements or criteria prescribed in subpart O and the grant amount is reduced.
