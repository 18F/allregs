                                Sec.  145.25  Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any State that seeks to administer a program under this part shall submit a Memorandum of Agreement. The Memorandum of Agreement shall be executed by the State Director and the Regional Administrator and shall become effective when approved by the Administrator. In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the Memorandum of Agreement may include other terms, conditions, or agreements consistent with this part and relevant to the administration and enforcement of the State's regulatory program. The Administrator shall not approve any Memorandum of Agreement which contains provisions which restrict EPA's statutory oversight responsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Memorandum of Agreement shall include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provisions for the prompt transfer from EPA to the State of pending permit applications and any other information relevant to program operation not already in the possession of the State Director (e.g., support files for permit issuance, compliance reports, etc.). When existing permits are transferred from EPA to State for administration, the Memorandum of Agreement shall contain provisions specifying a procedure for transferring the administration of these permits. If a State lacks the authority to directly administer permits issued by the Federal government, a procedure may be established to transfer responsibility for these permits.</p><p class="depth3">Note: For example, EPA and the State and the permittee could agree that the State would issue a permit(s) identical to the outstanding Federal permit which would simultaneously be terminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits, and proposed permits that the State will send to the Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to EPA. The State shall allow EPA to routinely review State records, reports, and files relevant to the administration and enforcement of the approved program. State reports may be combined with grant reports where appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provisions on the State's compliance monitoring and enforcement program, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA. These may specify the basis on which the Regional Administrator will select facilities or activities within the State for EPA inspection. The Regional Administrator will normally notify the State at least 7 days before any such inspection; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Procedures to assure coordination of enforcement activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When appropriate, provisions for joint processing of permits by the State and EPA, for facilities or activities which require permits from both

EPA and the State under different programs. See Sec.  124.4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Provisions for modification of the Memorandum of Agreement in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Memorandum of Agreement, the annual program and grant and the State/EPA Agreement should be consistent. If the State/EPA Agreement indicates that a change is needed in the Memorandum of Agreement, the Memorandum of Agreement may be amended through the procedures set forth in this part. The State/EPA Agreement may not override the Memorandum of Agreement.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Detailed program priorities and specific arrangements for EPA support of the State program will change and are therefore more appropriately negotiated in the context of annual agreements rather than in the MOA. However, it may still be appropriate to specify in the MOA the basis for such detailed agreements, e.g., a provision in the MOA specifying that EPA will select facilities in the State for inspection annually as part of the State/EPA agreement.</p>
