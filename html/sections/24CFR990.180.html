                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) The rolling base consumption level (RBCL) shall be equal to the average of yearly consumption levels for the 36-month period ending on the June 30th that is 18 months prior to the first day of the applicable funding period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The rolling base consumption level (RBCL) shall be equal to the average of yearly consumption levels for the 36-month period ending on the June 30th that is 18 months prior to the first day of the applicable funding period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The yearly consumption level is the actual amount of each utility consumed during a 12-month period ending June 30th. For example, for the funding period January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2006, the RBCL will be the average of the following yearly consumption levels:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Year 1 = July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2002.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Year 2 = July 1, 2002, through June 30, 2003.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Year 3 = July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2004.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (a)(2):</p><p class="depth4">In this example, the current year's consumption level will be July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2005.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Distortions to rolling base consumption level. The PHA shall have its RBCL determined so as not to distort the rolling base period in accordance with a method prescribed by HUD if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A project has not been in operation during at least 12 months of the rolling base period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A project enters or exits management after the rolling base period and prior to the end of the applicable funding period; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A project has experienced a conversion from one energy source to another, switched from PHA-supplied to resident-purchased utilities during or after the rolling base period, or for any other reason that would cause the RBCL not to be comparable to the current year's consumption level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Financial incentives. The three-year rolling base for all relevant utilities will be adjusted to reflect any financial incentives to the PHA to reduce consumption as described in Sec. 990.185.</p>
