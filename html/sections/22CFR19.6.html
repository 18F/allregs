                                Sec. 19.6  Court orders and divorce decrees.

Sec. 19.6-1  Orders by a court.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A court may--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fix the amount of any pension to a former spouse under Sec. 19.9, or order that none be paid;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fix the amount of any regular survivor annuity to a former spouse under paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec. 19.11, or order that none be paid;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Order provision of an additional survivor annuity for a spouse or former spouse under Sec. 19.10-5;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fix the amount of any benefit under Sec. 19.10-6 based on recall service payable to a former spouse to whom the annuitant was married during any portion of the recall service, or order that none be paid;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Fix the amount of any lump-sum payable to a former spouse under Sec. 19.13 or order that none be paid;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Order, to the extent consistent with any obligation stated in Sec. 19.8 between a participant and a former

spouse, and pursuant to any court decree of divorce, legal separation or annulment or any court ordered or approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce, legal separation, or annulment, that any payment from the Fund which would otherwise be made to a former participant based on his/her service shall be paid (in whole or in part) by the Secretary of State to a previous spouse or child of such participant. No apportionment under this paragraph may be made of a payment authorized to be paid to a survivor of a participant or annuitant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An order by a court that does not meet the definition of ``court'' in Sec. 19.2(f) is not valid for purposes of this section even though a divorce decree issued by such court may be a basis for pro rata share payments to a former spouse as described in these regulations.


Sec. 19.6-2  Qualifying court order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To be valid for purposes of this section, a court order must be found to be ``qualified'' by PER/ER/RET acting for the Secretary of State. A qualifying court order must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Be consistent with the terms of the Act and applicable regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Not direct payment of an amount in excess of the maximum amount authorized to be paid by the relevant regulation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Direct that payments be made to an eligible beneficiary from a principal's Foreign Service retirement benefit or survivor benefit. If a court directs or implies that a principal, rather than the Secretary of State or the Government, make the payments, the order will not be considered qualified unless the principal does not object during the 30-day notice period provided under Sec. 19.6-6;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Define the amount to be paid to a beneficiary in way so that it can be readily calculated from information in the normal files of the Department;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Not make payment contingent upon events other than those on which other payments from the Fund are based such as age, marital status and school attendance; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Not be in conflict with any previously issued court order which remains valid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No apportionment of annuity to a beneficiary under Sec. 19.6-1(a) (1) or (6) shall exceed the net annuity of the principal. The net annuity is computed by excluding from the gross annuity the amounts which are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Owed by the individual to the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deducted for health benefits premiums pursuant to section 8906 of Title 5, United States Code;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deducted for life insurance premiums under the Government Life Insurance Program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Owed due to overpayment of annuity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Properly withheld for Federal income tax purposes, if amounts withheld are not greater than they would be if the individual claimed all dependents to which he/she was entitled.
[46 FR 12958, Feb. 19, 1981. Redesignated and amended at 46 FR 18970, Mar. 27, 1981]


Sec. 19.6-3  Application for payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To receive payment from the Fund pursuant to a court award, the beneficiary must submit an application in writing to the Chief of the Retirement Division (PER/ER/RET), Department of State, Washington, DC 20520. The application must be typed or printed, signed by the beneficiary, and include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The full name, date of birth, current address and current marital status of the beneficiary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Full name and date of birth of the participant or former participant and his/her date of birth or other identifying information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Relationship to the beneficiary, and if a spouse or former spouse, date of marriage to and/or divorce from the participant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A statement that the court order has not been amended, superseded, or set aside;
The original of the court order or a recently certified copy must be enclosed with the application, or a statement appended that such a copy has been sent to the Department by other means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When payments are subject to termination upon the occurrence of a condition subsequent, such as marriage, remarriage or termination of schooling, or death of the principal, no payment will be made until the beneficiary submits a statement to PER/ER/RET that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The condition has not occured;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> He/she will notify the Department (PER/ER/RET) within 15 calendar days of the occurrence of the condition subsequent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> He/she will be personally liable for any overpayment to him/her resulting from the occurrence of the condition subsequent. PER/ER/RET may require periodic recertification of these statements.


Sec. 19.6-4  Date of court orders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A court order directing or barring payment of a pension to a former spouse under Sec. 19.9 may not be given effect by the Department if it is issued more than 12 months after the divorce becomes final. A court order adjusting the amount of a regular or additional survivor annuity to a former spouse under Sec. 19.11-2 or Sec. 19.10-5 may not be given effect by the Department if it is issued after the death of the principal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A court order issued within 12 months after a divorce becomes final directing payment of a pension to a former spouse in an amount other than provided in Sec. 19.9 may be made retroactively effective to the first of the month in which the divorce becomes final if so specified by the court. In such event, the Department will adjust any future payments that may become due to an annuitant and a former spouse by increasing one and correspondingly reducing the other in order to give effect to the order of the court. However, if future payments to one party are not due, as for example if a court orders that no payments be made to a former spouse, or that 100 percent of an annuity be paid as pension to a former spouse, the Department will not give retroactive effect to a court order by collecting overpayments from one party in order to pay them to the other party and will not make overpayments from the Fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A court order under this chapter involving any payment other than a pension to a former spouse under Sec. 19.9 may not be given retroactive effect and shall not be effective until it is determined to be a qualifying order under Sec. 19.6-5.


Sec. 19.6-5  Preliminary review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Upon receipt of an application for payment under Sec. 19.6-3, PER/ER/RET will determine whether--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The application is complete;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The applicant is an eligible beneficiary under this chapter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The court order is a qualifying order. If the application is completed, the beneficiary is eligible and the court order appears on its face to be a qualifying order, PER/ER/RET will provide the notification required by Sec. 19.6-6, otherwise, it will notify the applicant of any deficiency or requirement for additional information, and if the order is determined to be non-qualifying, the basis for such determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Upon receipt of a certified copy of a final decree of divorce, PER/ER/RET will determine whether--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is a valid decree. Any decree recognized as valid by the parties will be considered valid for this purpose. In addition, any non-recognized decree will be considered valid for this purpose unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em> Neither party was domiciled within the court's jurisdiction, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Neither party was domiciled within the court's jurisdiction, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The party denying recognition did not participate in the proceedings, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The party denying recognition was not afforded notice of the proceedings (actual or constructive);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A related court order has been submitted by either party; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A pro rata share payment is or may become due the former spouse. If a divorce decree is deemed valid under this paragraph, a pro rata share payment is due a former spouse unless PER/ER/RET is in receipt of a court order which it has deemed qualified under paragraph (a) of this section, or a valid spousal agrement providing otherwise. If it determines that a pro rata share payment is due, it will provide the notification required by Sec. 19.6-6, otherwise, unless action is being taken pursuant to a related court order, it will notify both parties to the

divorce the reason a pro rata share payment is not payable.
[46 FR 12958, Feb. 19, 1981. Redesignated and amended at 46 FR 18970, Mar. 27, 1981]


Sec. 19.6-6  Notification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Notification to a principal. Whenever PER/ER/RET receives from a former spouse or other eligible beneficiary--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> a court order which it deems qualified that requires payment to the beneficiary; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A final decree of divorce which it deems valid together with a request for a pro rata share payment--PER/ER/RET will send a copy of the document to the principal and a notice stating: (i) That PER/ER/RET deems the order qualified or the divorce decree valid, (ii) that payments will be made from the principal's account to the beneficiary and the effective date of such payments, (iii) the effect of such payments on the principal's retirement benefit. In the case of any court order with retroactive or immediate effect, and in the case of pro rata share payments, the amounts will be withheld from future payments to the principal but will not be paid to the beneficiary for 30 days from the notice date in order to give the principal an opportunity to contest the court order or the validity of the divorce.
PER/ER/RET will provide the former spouse or other beneficiary the same information, stating the exact amount that will be payable to the beneficiary and explaining how that amount was calculated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notification to a former spouse. When PER/ER/RET receives from a principal--(1) a court order which it deems qualified that requires or forbids payment to a former spouse; or (2) a final decree of divorce which it deems valid without an accompanying court order--PER/ER/RET will send a copy of the document to the former spouse and a notice stating: (i) That PER/ER/RET deems the court order qualified or the divorce decree valid, (ii) that PER/ER/RET intends to honor the court decree or to make pro rata share payments because of the divorce, (iii) the effective date, exact amount, and method of calculation of any payments to the former spouse.
PER/ER/RET will provide the same information to the principal and will explain the effect any payment to a former spouse will have on the principal's retirement benefit.


Sec. 19.6-7  Decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> When a response has not been received by PER/ER/RET from a principal within the 30-day period under Sec. 19.6-6a, payment will be made in accordance with the notification. When a response is received, the Chief, PER/ER/RET will consider the response. If it is shown that a court order is not qualifying or that a divorce is not valid under terms of the Act and these regulations, payment proposed in the notification will not be made. In such a case, PER/ER/RET will advise both parties of the basis for its decision and the alternative action, if any, that it proposes to take.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If a principal responding to a notification under Sec. 19.6-6a objects to the payment or other action proposed by the Department in the notification based on the validity of the court order or divorce decree, and the record contains support for the objection, PER/ER/RET will grant the principal 30 days to initiate formal legal action to determine the validity of the objection, will continue to delay payment to the former spouse or other beneficiary during this period, and will notify the beneficiary of this action. If evidence is submitted that formal legal action has been started within the 30-day period, the amount of any proposed payment to a former spouse or other beneficiary will continue to be withheld from any payments due the principal, but no payment will be made to the former spouse or other beneficiary until a judicial decision is rendered or agreement reached between the parties.
[46 FR 12958, Feb. 19, 1981. Redesignated and amended at 46 FR 18970, Mar. 27, 1981]


Sec. 19.6-8  Allotment to beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0">If a court order is not a qualifying court order because it directs or implies that payment to the beneficiary is to be made by the principal rather than the Secretary of State, the principal may make an allotment to the beneficiary from his/her annuity. An annuitant may also make an allotment

from his/her annuity to a previous spouse in the absence of a court order.


Sec. 19.6-9  Limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Retirement benefits are subject to apportionment by court order under Sec. 19.6-1(a)(6) only while the principal is living. Payment of apportioned amounts will be made only to a previous spouse and/or the children of the principal. Such payments will not be made to any of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Heirs or legatees of the previous spouse;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Creditors of either the principal or the previous spouse; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Assignees of either the principal or the previous spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amount of any court ordered payment may not be less than one dollar and, in the absence of compelling circumstances, shall be in whole dollars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In honoring and complying with a court order, the Department shall not be required to disrupt the scheduled method of accruing retirement benefits or the normal timing for making such payments, despite the existence of any special schedule relating to a previous spouse or other beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In cases where the court order apportions a percentage of the retirement benefits, PER/ER/RET will initially determine the amount of proper payment. That amount will only be increased by future cost-of-living increases unless the court directs otherwise.


Sec. 19.6-10  Liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Department shall not be liable for any payment made from retirement benefits pursuant to a court order if such payment is made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the event that the Secretary is served with more than one court order with respect to the same retirement benefits, the benefits shall be available to satisfy the court orders on a first-come, first-served basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A previous spouse or other beneficiary may request that an amount be withheld from the retirement benefits of a principal or survivor of a principal which is less than the amount stipulated in a court order, or otherwise scheduled to be paid to the beneficiary under this chapter. This lower amount will be deemed a complete fulfillment of the obligation of the Department for the period in which the request is in effect. See Sec. 19.14.</p>
