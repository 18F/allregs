                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Venting required. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On all tankships, the construction or  conversion of which is started on or after July 1, 1951, each cargo tank  shall be equipped with a vent. The diameter of a vent shall be not less  than 2\1/2\ inches.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In any case where a venting system is required for a particular  grade of liquid, the venting system permitted for a higher grade of  liquid may be used instead.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grade A liquids. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cargo tanks in which Grade A liquids are to  be transported must be fitted with a venting system consisting of a  branch vent line from each cargo tank connected to a vent header which  must extend to a height above the weather deck equal to at least 13.1  feet and must terminate at a comparable distance from any living or  working space, ventilator inlet, or source of ignition. When special  conditions will prevent the vent line or header outlets being  permanently installed at a height above the deck of 13.1 feet an  adjustable system must be provided which, when extended vertically, is  capable of reaching a height of 13.1 feet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A weather hood may be installed at the vent outlet providing it  is of such design as not to direct the flow of vapor below the  horizontal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The branch vent lines shall consist of either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pipe with no valves or other hindrances to a free flow of gas;  or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Piping fitted with a pressure vacuum relief valve, provided  means are supplied for relieving all internal pressure on cargo tanks by  fitting the valve with a positive means for opening its pressure valve  to allow free passage of gases through the branch vent line or by the  installation of a by-pass fitted with a manually operated stop valve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The vent header shall be fitted with a flame arrester or  pressure vacuum relief valve. If a pressure vacuum relief valve is used  in the header, means shall be provided for relieving all internal  pressure on cargo tanks by fitting the valve with a positive means for  opening its pressure valve to allow free passage of gases through the  header or by the installation of a by-pass fitted with a manually  operated stop valve. A suitable means of relieving pressure shall be  fitted in the header in order to prevent excess pressure being built up  in the tanks, in the event of overfilling of the latter. The vent header  system shall be provided with suitable connections for flushing and  draining. The vent header system shall be of sufficient capacity as to  be able to carry off all displaced air and vapors during loading of the  cargo tanks without opening of ullage plates, cargo hatches, etc. See  Sec. 32.20-20 for liquid level gaging requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Grade B or C liquids. Cargo tanks in which Grade B or C liquids  are to be transported shall be fitted with either individual pressure- vacuum relief valves which shall extend to a reasonable height above the  weather deck or shall be fitted with a venting system consisting of  branch vent lines connected to a vent header which shall extend to a  reasonable height above the weather deck and be fitted with a flame  arrester or a pressure-vacuum relief valve. The vent header system, if   fitted, shall be provided with suitable connections for flushing and  draining, and if desired, stop valves may be placed in the individual  branch vent lines provided that each stop valve is bypassed by a  pressure-vacuum relief valve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Grade D or E liquids. Cargo tanks in which Grade D or E liquids  only are to be transported shall be fitted with gooseneck vents and  flame screens.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Tank vents which meet the requirements of SOLAS will be  considered equivalent to the provisions of this section.
