Within 30 days after the certificate holder receives such notice, the certificate holder may file a petition to reconsider the notice with the Director, Flight Standards Service. This filing of a petition to reconsider stays the notice pending a decision by the Director, Flight Standards Service. However, if the certificate-holding district office finds that there is an emergency that requires immediate action in the interest of safety in air transportation, the Director, Flight Standards Service may, upon a statement of the reasons, require a change effective without stay.
