                            <p class="depth0">Exhaust gas boilers with a maximum allowable working pressure greater than 103 kPa gage (15 psig) or an operating temperature greater than 454 [deg]C. (850 [deg]F.) must be designed, constructed, inspected, tested and stamped in accordance with the applicable provisions in this part. The design temperature of parts exposed to the exhaust gas must be the maximum temperature that could normally be produced by the source of the exhaust gas. This temperature must be verified by testing or by the manufacturer of the engine or other equipment producing the exhaust. Automatic exhaust gas boiler control systems must be designed, constructed, tested, and inspected in accordance with Sec. 63.25-7 of this chapter.
