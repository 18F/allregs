Deposit Account holders can charge copyright fees against the balance in their accounts instead of sending separate remittances with each request for service. For information on Deposit Accounts, see Circular 5 on the U.S. Copyright Office's Web site, or request a copy at the address specified in Sec.  201.1.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix A to Sec.  201.39--Required Format of Notice to Libraries and Archives of Normal Commercial Exploitation or Availability at Reasonable</p><p class="depth0">Price
