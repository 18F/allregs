                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unless otherwise prescribed, claims for death, personal injury,  or damage to, or loss of, property (real or personal) are payable under  this subpart when the injury or damage is   caused by negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of military personnel  or civilian employees of the Department of the Army or Department of  Defense while acting within the scope of their employment under  circumstances in which the United States, if a private person, would be  liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the  act or omission occurred. The FTCA is a limited waiver of sovereign  immunity without which the United States may not be sued in tort.  Similarly, neither the Fifth Amendment nor any other provision of the  U.S. Constitution creates or permits a federal cause of action allowing  recovery in tort. Immunity must be expressly waived, as the FTCA waives  it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of this part.</p>
