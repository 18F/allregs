                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This part governs the treatment of nonpublic personal information about consumers by the financial institutions listed in paragraph (b) of this section. This part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requires a financial institution in specified circumstances to provide notice to customers about its privacy policies and practices;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describes the conditions under which a financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provides a method for consumers to prevent a financial institution from disclosing that information to most nonaffiliated third parties by ``opting out'' of that disclosure, subject to the exceptions in Sec. Sec. 313.13, 313.14, and 313.15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. This part applies only to nonpublic personal information about individuals who obtain financial products or services primarily for personal, family or household purposes from the institutions listed below. This part does not apply to information about companies or about individuals who obtain financial products or services for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes. This part applies to those ``financial institutions'' and ``other persons'' over which the Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has enforcement authority pursuant to Section 505(a)(7) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. An entity is a ``financial institution'' if its business is engaging in a financial activity as described in Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U.S.C. 1843(k), which incorporates by reference activities enumerated by the Federal Reserve Board in 12 CFR 211.5(d) and 12 CFR 225.28. The ``financial institutions'' subject to the Commission's enforcement authority are those that are not otherwise subject to the enforcement authority of another regulator under Section 505 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. More specifically, those entities include, but are not limited to, mortgage lenders, ``pay day'' lenders, finance companies, mortgage brokers, account servicers, check cashers, wire transferors, travel agencies operated in connection with financial services, collection agencies, credit counselors and other financial advisors, tax preparation firms, non-federally insured credit unions, and investment advisors that are not required to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They are referred to in this part as ``You.'' The ``other persons'' to whom this part applies are third parties that are not financial institutions, but that receive nonpublic personal information from financial institutions with whom they are not affiliated. Nothing in this part modifies, limits, or supersedes the standards governing individually identifiable health information promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the authority of sections 262 and 264 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, 42 U.S.C. 1320d-1320d-8. Any institution of higher education that complies with the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (``FERPA''), 20 U.S.C. 1232g, and its implementing regulations, 34 CFR part 99, and that is also a financial institution subject to the requirements of this part, shall be deemed to be in compliance with this part if it is in compliance with FERPA.</p>
