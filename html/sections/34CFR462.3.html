Tests are not limited to traditional paper and pencil (or computer-administered) instruments for which forms are constructed prior to administration to examinees. Tests may also include adaptive tests that use computerized algorithms for selecting and administering items in real time; however, for such instruments, the size of the item pool and the method of item selection must ensure negligible overlap in items across pre- and post-testing.</p><p class="depth5">Test administrator means an individual who is trained to administer tests the Secretary determines to be suitable under this part.</p><p class="depth5">Test publisher means an entity, individual, organization, or agency that owns a registered copyright of a test or is licensed by the copyright holder to sell or distribute a test.
