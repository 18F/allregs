Starting in January of 1995 at least 30% of the subject  vehicles shall participate in the test-only system (in States with  multiple I/M areas, implementation is not required in every area by  January 1995 as long as statewide, 30% of the subject vehicles are  involved in testing) and shall be subject to the new test procedures  (including the evaporative system checks, visual inspections, and  tailpipe emission tests). By January 1, 1996, all applicable vehicle  model years and types shall be included in the test-only system. During  the phase-in period, all requirements of this subpart shall be applied  to the test-only portion of the program; existing requirements may  continue to apply for the test-and-repair portion of the program until  it is phased out by January 1, 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Areas starting new test-only programs and those with existing  test-only programs may also phase in the new test procedures between  January 1, 1995 and January 1, 1996.

Alternatively, states may elect to   phase-in OBD-I/M testing for one test cycle by using the OBD-I/M check  to screen clean vehicles from tailpipe testing and require repair and  retest for only those vehicles which proceed to fail the tailpipe test.  An additional alternative is also available to states with regard to the  deadline for mandatory testing, repair, and retesting of vehicles based  upon the OBD-I/M check. Under this third option, if a state can show  good cause (and the Administrator takes notice-and-comment action to  approve this good cause showing), up to an additional 12 months'  extension may be granted, establishing an alternative start date for  such states of no later than January 1, 2003. States choosing to make  this showing will also have available to them the phase-in approach  described in this section, with the one-cycle time limit to begin  coincident with the alternative start date established by Administrator  approval of the showing, but no later than January 1, 2003.

Appendix A to Subpart S of Part 51--Calibrations, Adjustments and</p><p class="depth0">Quality Control</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Steady-State Test Equipment</p><p class="depth0">States may opt to use transient emission test equipment for steady- state tests and follow the quality control requirements in paragraph  (II) of this appendix instead of the following requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Equipment shall be calibrated in accordance with the  manufacturers' instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Prior to each test--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Hydrocarbon hang-up check. Immediately  prior to each test the analyzer shall automatically perform a  hydrocarbon hang-up check. If the HC reading, when the probe is sampling  ambient air, exceeds 20 ppm, the system shall be purged with clean air  or zero gas. The analyzer shall be inhibited from continuing the test  until HC levels drop below 20 ppm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Automatic zero and span. The analyzer shall conduct an automatic  zero and span check prior to each test. The span check shall include the  HC, CO, and CO2 channels, and the NO and O2 channels, if  present. If zero and/or span drift cause the signal levels to move  beyond the adjustment range of the analyzer, it shall lock out from  testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Low flow. The system shall lock out from testing if sample flow  is below the acceptable level as defined in paragraph (I)(b)(6) of  appendix D to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Leak check. A system leak check shall be performed within  twenty-four hours before the test in low volume stations (those  performing less than the 4,000 inspections per year) and within four  hours in high-volume stations (4,000 or more inspections per year) and  may be performed in conjunction with the gas calibration described in  paragraph (I)(d)(1) of this appendix. If a leak check is not performed  within the preceding twenty-four hours in low volume stations and within  four hours in high-volume stations or if the analyzer fails the leak  check, the analyzer shall lock out from testing. The leak check shall be  a procedure demonstrated to effectively check the sample hose and probe  for leaks and shall be performed in accordance with good engineering  practices. An error of more than 2% of the reading  using low range span gas shall cause the analyzer to lock out from  testing and shall require repair of leaks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Gas calibration. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> On each operating day in high-volume  stations, analyzers shall automatically require and successfully pass a  two-point gas calibration for HC, CO, and CO2 and shall continually  compensate for changes in barometric pressure. Calibration shall be  checked within four hours before the test and the analyzer adjusted if  the reading is more than 2% different from the span gas value. In low- volume stations, analyzers shall undergo a two-point calibration within  seventy-two hours before each test, unless changes in barometric  pressure are compensated for automatically and statistical process  control demonstrates equal or better quality control using different  frequencies. Gas calibration shall be accomplished by introducing span  gas that meets the requirements of paragraph (I)(d)(3) of this appendix  into the analyzer through the calibration port. If the analyzer reads  the span gas within the allowable tolerance range (i.e., the square root  of sum of the squares of the span gas tolerance described in paragraph  (I)(d)(3) of this appendix and the calibration tolerance, which shall be  equal to 2%), no adjustment of the analyzer is necessary. The gas  calibration procedure shall correct readings that exceed the allowable  tolerance range to   the center of the allowable tolerance range. The pressure in the sample  cell shall be the same with the calibration gas flowing during  calibration as with the sample gas flowing during sampling. If the  system is not calibrated, or the system fails the calibration check, the  analyzer shall lock out from testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Span points. A two point gas calibration procedure shall be  followed. The span shall be accomplished at one of the following pairs  of span points:  (A) 300--ppm propane (HC) 1.0--% carbon monoxide (CO) 6.0--% carbon dioxide (CO2) 1000--ppm nitric oxide (if equipped with NO) 1200--ppm propane (HC) 4.0--% carbon monoxide (CO) 12.0--% carbon dioxide (CO2) 3000--ppm nitric oxide (if equipped with NO) (B) --ppm propane 0.0--% carbon monoxide 0.0--% carbon dioxide 0--ppm nitric oxide (if equipped with NO) 600--ppm propane (HC) 1.6--% carbon monoxide (CO) 11.0--% carbon dioxide (CO2) 1200--ppm nitric oxide (if equipped with NO)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Span gases. The span gases used for the gas calibration shall be  traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  standards 2%, and shall be within two percent of  the span points specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this appendix. Zero  gases shall conform to the specifications given in Sec. 86.114-79(a)(5)  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Dynamometer checks--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Monthly check. Within one month  preceding each loaded test, the accuracy of the roll speed indicator  shall be verified and the dynamometer shall be checked for proper power  absorber settings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Semi-annual check. Within six months preceding each loaded test,  the road-load response of the variable-curve dynamometer or the  frictional power absorption of the dynamometer shall be checked by a  coast down procedure similar to that described in Sec. 86.118-78 of  this chapter. The check shall be done at 30 mph, and a power absorption  load setting to generate a total horsepower (hp) of 4.1 hp. The actual  coast down time from 45 mph to 15 mph shall be within 1 second of the time calculated by the following  equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC08NO91.014  where W is the total inertia weight as represented by the weight of the  rollers (excluding free rollers), and any inertia flywheels used,  measured in pounds. If the coast down time is not within the specified  tolerance the dynamometer shall be taken out of service and corrective  action shall be taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Other checks. In addition to the above periodic checks, these  shall also be used to verify system performance under the following  special circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Gas Calibration. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Each time the analyzer electronic or  optical systems are repaired or replaced, a gas calibration shall be  performed prior to returning the unit to service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In high-volume stations, monthly multi-point calibrations shall  be performed. Low-volume stations shall perform multi-point calibrations  every six months. The calibration curve shall be checked at 20%, 40%,  60%, and 80% of full scale and adjusted or repaired if the  specifications in appendix D(I)(b)(1) to this subpart are not met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Leak checks. Each time the sample line integrity is broken, a  leak check shall be performed prior to testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(II)</em> Transient Test Equipment</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Dynamometer. Once per week, the calibration of each dynamometer  and each fly wheel shall be checked by a dynamometer coast-down  procedure comparable to that in Sec. 86.118-78 of this chapter between  the speeds of 55 to 45 mph, and between 30 to 20 mph. All rotating  dynamometer components shall be included in the coast-down check for the  inertia weight selected. For dynamometers with uncoupled rolls, the  uncoupled rollers may undergo a separate coast-down check. If a vehicle  is used to motor the dynamometer to the beginning coast-down speed, the  vehicle shall be lifted off the dynamometer rolls before the coast-down  test begins. If the difference between the measured coast-down time and  the theoretical coast-down time is greater than +1 second, the system  shall lock out, until corrective action brings the dynamometer into  calibration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Constant volume sampler. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The constant volume sampler (CVS)  flow calibration shall be checked daily by a procedure that identifies  deviations in flow from the true value. Deviations greater than 4% shall be corrected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The sample probe shall be cleaned and checked at least once per  month. The main CVS venturi shall be cleaned and checked at least once  per year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Verification that flow through the sample probe is adequate for  the design shall be done daily. Deviations greater than the design  tolerances shall be corrected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Analyzer system--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Calibration checks. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Upon initial  operation, calibration curves shall be generated for each analyzer. The  calibration curve shall consider the entire range of the analyzer as one  curve. At least 6 calibration points plus zero shall be used in the  lower portion of the range corresponding to an average concentration of  approximately 2 gpm for HC, 30 gpm for CO, 3 gpm for NOX, and  400 gpm for CO2. For the case where a low and a high range  analyzer   is used, the high range analyzer shall use at least 6 calibration points  plus zero in the lower portion of the high range scale corresponding to  approximately 100% of the full-scale value of the low range analyzer.  For all analyzers, at least 6 calibration points shall also be used to  define the calibration curve in the region above the 6 lower calibration  points. Gas dividers may be used to obtain the intermediate points for  the general range classifications specified. The calibration curves  generated shall be a polynomial of no greater order than 4th order, and  shall fit the date within 0.5% at each calibration point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For all calibration curves, curve checks, span adjustments, and  span checks, the zero gas shall be considered a down-scale reference  gas, and the analyzer zero shall be set at the trace concentration value  of the specific zero gas used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The basic curve shall be checked monthly by the same procedure  used to generate the curve, and to the same tolerances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> On a daily basis prior to vehicle testing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The curve for each analyzer shall be checked by adjusting the  analyzer to correctly read a zero gas and an up-scale span gas, and then  by correctly reading a mid-scale span gas within 2% of point. If the  analyzer does not read the mid-scale span point within 2% of point, the  system shall lock out. The up-scale span gas concentration for each  analyzer shall correspond to approximately 80 percent of full scale, and  the mid-point concentration shall correspond to approximately 15 percent  of full scale; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> After the up-scale span check, each analyzer in a given facility  shall analyze a sample of a random concentration corresponding to  approximately 0.5 to 3 times the cut point (in gpm) for the constituent.  The value of the random sample may be determined by a gas blender. The  deviation in analysis from the sample concentration for each analyzer  shall be recorded and compared to the historical mean and standard  deviation for the analyzers at the facility and at all facilities. Any  reading exceeding 3 sigma shall cause the analyzer to lock out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Flame ionization detector check. Upon initial operation, and  after maintenance to the detector, each Flame Ionization Detector (FID)  shall be checked, and adjusted if necessary, for proper peaking and  characterization. Procedures described in SAE Paper No. 770141 are  recommended for this purpose. A copy of this paper may be obtained from  the Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. (SAE), 400 Commonwealth Drive,  Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 15096-0001. Additionally, every month the  response of each FID to a methane concentration of approximately 50 ppm  CH4 shall be checked. If the response is outside of the range  of 1.10 to 1.20, corrective action shall be taken to bring the FID  response within this range. The response shall be computed by the  following formula: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC08NO91.015</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Spanning frequency. The zero and up-scale span point shall be  checked, and adjusted if necessary, at 2 hour intervals following the  daily mid-scale curve check. If the zero or the up-scale span point  drifts by more than 2% for the previous check (except for the first  check of the day), the system shall lock out, and corrective action  shall be taken to bring the system into compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Spanning limit checks. The tolerance on the adjustment of the  up-scale span point is 0.4% of point. A software algorithm to perform  the span adjustment and subsequent calibration curve adjustment shall be  used. However, software up-scale span adjustments greater than 10% shall cause the system to lock out, requiring system  maintenance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Integrator checks. Upon initial operation, and every three  months thereafter, emissions from a randomly selected vehicle with  official test value greater than 60% of the standard (determined  retrospectively) shall be simultaneously sampled by the normal  integration method and by the bag method in each lane. The data from  each method shall be put into a historical data base for determining  normal and deviant performance for each test lane, facility, and all  facilities combined. Specific deviations exceeding 5% shall require corrective action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Interference. CO and CO2 analyzers shall be checked  prior to initial service, and on a yearly basis thereafter, for water  interference. The specifications and procedures used shall generally  comply with either Sec. 86.122-78 or Sec. 86.321-79 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> NOX converter check. The converter efficiency of the  NO2 to NO converter shall be checked on a weekly basis. The  check shall generally conform to Sec. 86.123-78 of this chapter, or EPA  MVEL Form 305-01. Equivalent methods may be approved by the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> NO/NOX flow balance. The flow balance between the NO  and NOX test modes shall be checked weekly. The check may be  combined   with the NOX convertor check as illustrated in EPA MVEL Form  305-01.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Additional checks. Additional checks shall be performed on the  HC, CO, CO2, and NOX analyzers according to best  engineering practices for the measurement technology used to ensure that  measurements meet specified accuracy requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> System artifacts (hang-up). Prior to each test a comparison  shall be made between the background HC reading, the HC reading measured  through the sample probe (if different), and the zero gas. Deviations  from the zero gas greater than 10 parts per million carbon (ppmC) shall  cause the analyzer to lock out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Ambient background. The average of the pre-test and post-test  ambient background levels shall be compared to the permissible levels of  10 ppmC HC, 20 ppm CO, and 1 ppm NOX. If the permissible  levels are exceeded, the test shall be voided and corrective action  taken to lower the ambient background concentrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Analytical gases. Zero gases shall meet the requirements of  Sec. 86.114-79(a)(5) of this chapter. NOX calibration gas  shall be a single blend using nitrogen as the diluent. Calibration gas  for the flame ionization detector shall be a single blend of propane  with a diluent of air. Calibration gases for CO and CO2 shall  be single blends using nitrogen or air as a diluent. Multiple blends of  HC, CO, and CO2 in air may be used if shown to be stable and  accurate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(III)</em> Purge Analysis System</p><p class="depth0">On a daily basis each purge flow meter shall be checked with a  simulated purge flow against a reference flow measuring device with  performance specifications equal to or better than those specified for  the purge meter. The check shall include a mid-scale rate check, and a  total flow check between 10 and 20 liters. Deviations greater than  5% shall be corrected. On a monthly basis, the  calibration of purge meters shall be checked for proper rate and total  flow with three equally spaced points across the flow rate and the  totalized flow range. Deviations exceeding the specified accuracy shall  be corrected. The dynamometer quality assurance checks required under  paragraph (II) of this appendix shall also apply to the dynamometer used  for purge tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(IV)</em> Evaporative System Integrity Test Equipment</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> On a weekly basis pressure measurement devices shall be checked  against a reference device with performance specifications equal to or  better than those specified for the measurement device. Deviations  exceeding the performance specifications shall be corrected. Flow  measurement devices, if any, shall be checked according to paragraph III  of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Systems that monitor evaporative system leaks shall be checked  for integrity on a daily basis by sealing and pressurizing.

The  analysis of exhaust gas concentrations shall begin 10 seconds after the  applicable test mode begins. Exhaust gas concentrations shall be  analyzed at a minimum rate of two times per second. The measured value  for pass/fail determinations shall be a simple running average of the  measurements taken over five seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pass/fail determination. A pass or fail determination shall be  made for each applicable test mode based on a comparison of the short  test standards contained in appendix C to this subpart, and the measured  value for HC and CO as described in paragraph (I)(a)(1) of this  appendix. A vehicle shall pass the test mode if any pair of simultaneous  measured values for HC and CO are below or equal to the applicable short  test standards. A vehicle shall fail the test mode if the values for  either HC or CO, or both, in all simultaneous pairs of values are above  the applicable standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Void test conditions. The test shall immediately end and any  exhaust gas measurements shall be voided if the measured concentration  of CO plus CO2 falls below six percent or the vehicle's  engine stalls at any time during the test sequence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Multiple exhaust pipes. Exhaust gas concentrations from vehicle  engines equipped with multiple exhaust pipes shall be sampled  simultaneously.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> This test shall be immediately terminated upon reaching the  overall maximum test time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Test sequence. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The test sequence shall consist of a first- chance test and a second-chance test as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The first-chance test, as described under paragraph (c) of this  section, shall consist of an idle mode.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The second-chance test as described under paragraph (I)(d) of  this appendix shall be performed only if the vehicle fails the first- chance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The test sequence shall begin only after the following  requirements are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The vehicle shall be tested in as-received condition with the  transmission in neutral or park and all accessories turned off.
