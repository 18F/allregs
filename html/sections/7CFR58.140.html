The purpose of the visit shall be to inspect the milking equipment and facilities and to offer assistance to improve the quality of the producer's milk and eliminate any potential causes of drug residues. A representative of the plant should routinely visit each producer as often as necessary to assist and encourage the production of high quality milk.
