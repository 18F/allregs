                                Sec. 404.1597  After we make a determination that you are not now disabled.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. If we determine that you do not meet the disability  requirements of the law, your benefits generally will stop. We will send  you a formal written notice telling you why we believe you are not  disabled and when your benefits should stop. If your spouse and children  are receiving benefits on your social security number, we will also stop  their benefits and tell them why. The notices will explain your right to  reconsideration if you disagree with our determination. However, your  benefits may continue even though your impairment is no longer  disabling, if you are participating in an appropriate program of  vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other  support services (see Sec. 404.327). You must have started participating  in the program before the date your disability ended. In addition, we  must have determined that your completion of the program, or your  continuation in the program for a specified period of time, will  increase the likelihood that you will not have to return to the  disability benefit rolls. (See Secs. 404.316(c), 404.328, 404.337(c),  404.352(d), and 404.1586(g).) You may still appeal our determination  that you are not disabled even though your benefits are continuing  because of your participation in an appropriate program of vocational  rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services.  You may also appeal a determination that your completion of the program,  or your continuation in the program for a specified period of time, will  not increase the likelihood that you will not have to return to the  disability benefit rolls and, therefore, you are not entitled to  continue to receive benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If we make a determination that your physical or mental  impairment(s) has ceased, did not exist, or is no longer disabling  (Medical Cessation Determination). If we make a determination that the  physical or mental impairment(s) on the basis of which benefits were  payable has ceased, did not exist, or is no longer disabling (a medical  cessation determination), your benefits will stop. As described in  paragraph (a) of this section, you will receive a written notice  explaining this determination and the month your benefits will stop. The  written notice will also explain your right to appeal if you disagree  with our determination and your right to request that your benefits and  the benefits, if any, of your spouse or children, be continued under  Sec. 404.1597a. For the purpose of this section, benefits means  disability cash payments and/or Medicare, if applicable. The continued  benefit provisions of this section do not apply to an initial  determination on an application for disability benefits, or to a  determination that you were disabled only for a specified period of  time.  [47 FR 31544, July 21, 1982, as amended at 51 FR 17618, May 14, 1986; 53  FR 29020, Aug. 2, 1988; 53 FR 39015, Oct. 4, 1988; 70 FR 36507, June 24,  2005]    Sec. 404.1597a  Continued benefits pending appeal of a medical cessation determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. If we determine that you are not entitled to benefits  because the physical or mental impairment(s) on the basis of which such  benefits were payable is found to have ceased, not to have existed, or  to no longer be disabling, and you appeal that determination, you may  choose to have your benefits continued pending reconsideration and/or a  hearing before an administrative law judge on the disability cessation  determination. For the purpose of this entire section, the election of  continued benefits means the election of disability cash payments and/or  Medicare, if applicable. You can also choose to have the benefits  continued for anyone else receiving benefits based on your wages and  self-employment income (and anyone else receiving benefits because of  your entitlement to benefits based on disability). If you appeal   a medical cessation under both title II and title XVI (a concurrent  case), the title II claim will be handled in accordance with title II  regulations while the title XVI claim will be handled in accordance with  the title XVI regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When the provisions of this section are available. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Benefits  may be continued under this section only if the determination that your  physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no  longer disabling is made on or after January 12, 1983 (or before January  12, 1983, and a timely request for reconsideration or a hearing before  an administrative law judge is pending on that date).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Benefits may be continued under this section only for months  beginning with January 1983, or the first month for which benefits are  no longer otherwise payable following our determination that your  physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no  longer disabling, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Continued payment of benefits under this section will stop  effective with the earlier of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The month before the month in which an administrative law  judge's hearing decision finds that your physical or mental  impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling  or the month before the month of a new administrative law judge decision  (or final action by the Appeals Council on the administrative law  judge's recommended decision) if your case was sent back to an  administrative law judge for further action; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The month before the month no timely request for a  reconsideration or a hearing before an administrative law judge is  pending. These continued benefits may be stopped or adjusted because of  certain events (such as work and earnings or receipt of worker's  compensation) which occur while you are receiving these continued  benefits and affect your right to receive continued benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Continuation of benefits for anyone else pending your appeal.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When you file a request for reconsideration or hearing before an  administrative law judge on our determination that your physical or  mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer  disabling, or your case has been sent back (remanded) to an  administrative law judge for further action, you may also choose to have  benefits continue for anyone else who is receiving benefits based on  your wages and self-employment income (and for anyone else receiving  benefits because of your entitlement to benefits based on disability),  pending the outcome of your appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If anyone else is receiving benefits based on your wages and  self-employment income, we will notify him or her of the right to choose  to have his or her benefits continue pending the outcome of your appeal.  Such benefits can be continued for the time period in paragraph (b) of  this section only if he or she chooses to have benefits continued and  you also choose to have his or her benefits continued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Statement of choice. When you or another party request  reconsideration under Sec. 404.908(a) or a hearing before an  administrative law judge under Sec. 404.932(a) on our determination that  your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or  is no longer disabling, or if your case is sent back (remanded) to an  administrative law judge for further action, we will explain your right  to receive continued benefits and ask you to complete a statement  specifying which benefits you wish to have continued pending the outcome  of the reconsideration or hearing before an administrative law judge.  You may elect to receive only Medicare benefits during appeal even if  you do not want to receive continued disability benefits. If anyone else  is receiving benefits based on your wages and self-employment income (or  because of your entitlement to benefits based on disability), we will  ask you to complete a statement specifying which benefits you wish to  have continued for them, pending the outcome of the request for  reconsideration or hearing before an administrative law judge. If you  request appeal but you do not want to receive continued benefits, we  will ask you to complete a statement declining continued benefits  indicating that you do not want to have your benefits and those of your  family, if any, continued during the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Your spouse's or children's statement of choice. If you request,  in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, that benefits also be  continued for anyone who had been receiving benefits based on your wages  and self-employment, we will send them a written notice. The notice will  explain their rights and ask them to complete a statement either  declining continued benefits, or specifying which benefits they wish to  have continued, pending the outcome of the request for reconsideration  or a hearing before an administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> What you must do to receive continued benefits pending notice of  our reconsideration determination. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If you want to receive continued  benefits pending the outcome of your request for reconsideration, you  must request reconsideration and continuation of benefits no later than  10 days after the date you receive the notice of our initial  determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has  never existed, or is no longer disabling. Reconsideration must be  requested as provided in Sec. 404.909, and you must request continued  benefits using a statement in accordance with paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you fail to request reconsideration and continued benefits  within the 10-day period required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section,  but later ask that we continue your benefits pending a reconsidered  determination, we will use the rules in Sec. 404.911 to determine  whether good cause exists for your failing to request benefit  continuation within 10 days after receipt of the notice of the initial  cessation determination. If you request continued benefits after the 10- day period, we will consider the request to be timely and will pay  continued benefits only if good cause for delay is established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> What you must do to receive continued benefits pending an  administrative law judge's decision. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To receive continued benefits  pending an administrative law judge's decision on our reconsideration  determination, you must request a hearing and continuation of benefits  no later than 10 days after the date you receive the notice of our  reconsideration determination that your physical or mental impairment(s)  has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling. A hearing must  be requested as provided in Sec. 404.933, and you must request continued  benefits using a statement in accordance with paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you request continued benefits pending an administrative law  judge's decision but did not request continued benefits while we were  reconsidering the initial cessation determination, your benefits will  begin effective the month of the reconsideration determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you fail to request continued payment of benefits within the  10-day period required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section, but you  later ask that we continue your benefits pending an administrative law  judge's decision on our reconsidered determination, we will use the  rules as provided in Sec. 404.911 to determine whether good cause exists  for your failing to request benefit continuation within 10 days after  receipt of the reconsideration determination. If you request continued  benefits after the 10-day period, we will consider the request to be  timely and will pay continued benefits only if good cause for delay is  established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> What anyone else must do to receive continued benefits pending  our reconsideration determination or an administrative law judge's  decision. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When you or another party (see Secs. 404.908(a) and  404.932(a)) request a reconsideration or a hearing before an  administrative law judge on our medical cessation determination or when  your case is sent back (remanded) to an administrative law judge for  further action, you may choose to have benefits continue for anyone else  who is receiving benefits based on your wages and self-employment  income. An eligible individual must also choose whether or not to have  his or her benefits continue pending your appeal by completing a  separate statement of election as described in paragraph (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> He or she must request continuation of benefits no later than 10  days after the date he or she receives notice of termination of  benefits. He or she will then receive continued benefits beginning with  the later of January 1983, or the first month for which benefits   are no longer otherwise payable following our initial or reconsideration  determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has  never existed, or is no longer disabling. Continued benefits will  continue until the earlier of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The month before the month in which an administrative law  judge's hearing decision finds that your physical or mental  impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling  or the month before the month of the new administrative law judge  decision (or final action is taken by the Appeals Council on the  administrative law judge's recommended decision) if your case was sent  back to an administrative law judge for further action; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The month before the month no timely request for a  reconsideration or a hearing before an administrative law judge is  pending. These continued benefits may be stopped or adjusted because of  certain events (such as work and earnings or payment of worker's  compensation) which occur while an eligible individual is receiving  continued benefits and affect his or her right to receive continued  benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If he or she fails to request continuation of benefits within  the 10-day period required by this paragraph, but requests continuation  of benefits at a later date, we will use the rules as provided in  Sec. 404.911 to determine whether good cause exists for his or her  failure to request continuation of benefits within 10 days after receipt  of the notice of termination of his or her benefits. His or her late  request will be considered to be timely and we will pay him or her  continued benefits only if good cause for delay is established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If you choose not to have benefits continued for anyone else who  is receiving benefits based on your wages and self-employment income,  pending the appeal on our determination, we will not continue benefits  to him or her.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> What you must do when your case is remanded to an administrative  law judge. If we send back (remand) your case to an administrative law  judge for further action under the rules provided in Sec. 404.977, and  the administrative law judge's decision or dismissal order issued on  your medical cessation appeal is vacated and is no longer in effect,  continued benefits are payable pending a new decision by the  administrative law judge or final action is taken by the Appeals Council  on the administrative law judge's recommended decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If you (and anyone else receiving benefits based on your wages  and self-employment income or because of your disability) previously  elected to receive continued benefits pending the administrative law  judge's decision, we will automatically start these same continued  benefits again. We will send you a notice telling you this, and that you  do not have to do anything to have these same benefits continued until  the month before the month the new decision of order of dismissal is  issued by the administrative law judge or until the month before the  month the Appeals Council takes final action on the administrative law  judge's recommended decision. These benefits will begin again with the  first month of nonpayment based on the prior administrative law judge  hearing decision or dismissal order. Our notice explaining reinstatement  of continued benefits will also tell you to report to us any changes or  events that affect your receipt of benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After we automatically reinstate your continued benefits as  described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, we will contact you to  determine if any adjustment is required to the amount of continued  benefits payable due to events that affect the right to receive benefits  involving you, your spouse and/or children. If you have returned to  work, we will request additional information about this work activity.  If you are working, your continued benefits will not be stopped while  your appeal of the medical cessation of disability is still pending  unless you have completed a trial work period and are engaging in  substantial gainful activity. In this event, we will suspend your  continued benefits. If any other changes have occurred which would  require a reduction in benefit amounts, or nonpayment of benefits, we  will send an advance notice to advise of any adverse change before the  adjustment action is taken. The notice will also advise you of the   right to explain why these benefits should not be adjusted or stopped.  You will also receive a written notice of our determination. The notice  will also explain your right to reconsideration if you disagree with  this determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the final decision on your appeal of your medical cessation  is a favorable one, we will send you a written notice in which we will  advise you of your right to benefits, if any, before you engaged in  substantial gainful activity and to reentitlement should you stop  performing substantial gainful activity. If you disagree with our  determination, you will have the right to appeal this decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the final decision on your appeal of your medical cessation  is an unfavorable one (the cessation is affirmed), you will also be sent  a written notice advising you of our determination, and your right to  appeal if you think we are wrong.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If you (or the others receiving benefits based on your wages and  self-employment income or because of your disability) did not previously  elect to have benefits continued pending an administrative law judge  decision, and you now want to elect continued benefits, you must request  to do so no later than 10 days after you receive our notice telling you  about continued benefits. If you fail to request continued benefits  within the 10-day period required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section,  but later ask that we continue your benefits pending an administrative  law judge remand decision, we will use the rules in Sec. 404.911 to  determine whether good cause exists for your failing to request benefit  continuation within 10 days after receipt of the notice telling you  about benefit continuation. We will consider the request to be timely  and will pay continued benefits only if good cause for delay is  established. If you make this new election, benefits may begin with the  month of the order sending (remanding) your case back to the  administrative law judge. Before we begin to pay you continued benefits  as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section we will contact you to  determine if any adjustment is required to the amount of continued  benefits payable due to events which may affect your right to benefits.  If you have returned to work, we will request additional information  about this work activity. If you are working, continued benefits may be  started and will not be stopped because of your work while your appeal  of the medical cessation of your disability is still pending unless you  have completed a trial work period and are engaging in substantial  gainful activity. If any changes have occurred which establish a basis  for not paying continued benefits or a reduction in benefit amount, we  will send you a notice explaining the adjustment or the reason why we  cannot pay continued benefits. The notice will also explain your right  to reconsideration if you disagree with this determination. If the final  decision on your appeal of your medical cessation is a favorable one, we  will send you a written notice in which we will advise you of your right  to benefits, if any, before you engaged in substantial gainful activity  and to reentitlement should you stop performing substantial gainful  activity. If you disagree with our determination, you will have the  right to appeal this decision. If the final decision on your appeal of  your medical cessation is an unfavorable one (the cessation is  affirmed), you will also be sent a written notice advising you of our  determination, and your right to appeal if you think we are wrong.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If a court orders that your case be sent back to us (remanded)  and your case is sent to an administrative law judge for further action  under the rules provided in Sec. 404.983, the administrative law judge's  decision or dismissal order on your medical cessation appeal is vacated  and is no longer in effect. Continued benefits are payable to you and  anyone else receiving benefits based on your wages and self-employment  income or because of your disability pending a new decision by the  administrative law judge or final action is taken by the Appeals Council  on the administrative law judge's recommended decision. In these court- remanded cases reaching the administrative law judge, we will follow the  same rules provided in paragraphs (i) (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Responsibility to pay back continued benefits. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the final  decision of the   Commissioner affirms the determination that you are not entitled to  benefits, you will be asked to pay back any continued benefits you  receive. However, as described in the overpayment recovery and waiver  provisions of subpart F of this part, you will have the right to ask  that you not be required to pay back the benefits. You will not be asked  to pay back any Medicare benefits you received during the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Anyone else receiving benefits based on your wages and self- employment income (or because of your disability) will be asked to pay  back any continued benefits he or she received if the determination that  your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or  is no longer disabling, is not changed by the final decision of the  Commissioner. However, he or she will have the right to ask that he or  she not be required to pay them back, as described in the overpayment  recovery and waiver provisions of subpart F of this part. He or she will  not be asked to pay back any Medicare benefits he or she received during  the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Waiver of recovery of an overpayment resulting from the  continued benefits paid to you or anyone else receiving benefits based  on your wages and self-employment income (or because of your disability)  may be considered as long as the determination was appealed in good  faith. It will be assumed that such appeal is made in good faith and,  therefore, any overpaid individual has the right to waiver consideration  unless such individual fails to cooperate in connection with the appeal,  e.g., if the individual fails (without good reason) to give us medical  or other evidence we request, or to go for a physical or mental  examination when requested by us, in connection with the appeal. In  determining whether an individual has good cause for failure to  cooperate and, thus, whether an appeal was made in good faith, we will  take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic  limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language)  the individual may have which may have caused the individual's failure  to cooperate.
