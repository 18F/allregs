Sec. 63.7(e)(3) and 63.997(e)(1)(v). Each test run must last at least 1 hour, except as provided in Sec. 63.997(e)(1)(v)(A) and (B).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> In addition to EPA Method 25 or 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to determine compliance with the organic HAP or TOC emission limit, you may use EPA Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. As an alternative to EPA Method 18, you may use ASTM D6420-99 (Reapproved 2004), Standard Test Method for Determination of Gaseous Organic Compounds by Direct Interface Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14), under the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In addition to EPA Method 25 or 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to determine compliance with the organic HAP or TOC emission limit, you may use EPA Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. As an alternative to EPA Method 18, you may use ASTM D6420-99 (Reapproved 2004), Standard Test Method for Determination of Gaseous Organic Compounds by Direct Interface Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14), under the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If you use EPA Method 18 to measure compliance with the percentage efficiency limit, you must first determine which organic HAP are present in the inlet gas stream (i.e., uncontrolled emissions) using knowledge of the organic liquids or the screening procedure described in EPA Method 18. In conducting the performance test, you must analyze samples collected as specified in EPA Method 18, simultaneously at the inlet and outlet of the control device. Quantify the emissions for the same organic HAP identified as present in the inlet gas stream for both the inlet and outlet gas streams of the control device.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If you use EPA Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to measure compliance with the emission concentration limit, you must first determine which organic HAP are present in the inlet gas stream using knowledge of the organic liquids or the screening procedure described in EPA Method 18. In conducting the performance test, analyze samples collected as specified

in EPA Method 18 at the outlet of the control device. Quantify the control device outlet emission concentration for the same organic HAP identified as present in the inlet or uncontrolled gas stream.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You may use ASTM D6420-99 (Reapproved 2004), Standard Test Method for Determination of Gaseous Organic Compounds by Direct Interface Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14), as an alternative to EPA Method 18 if the target concentration is between 150 parts per billion by volume and 100 ppmv and either of the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section exists. For target compounds not listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99 (Reapproved 2004) and not amenable to detection by mass spectrometry, you may not use ASTM D6420-99 (Reapproved 2004).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The target compounds are those listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99 (Reapproved 2004), Standard Test Method for Determination of Gaseous Organic Compounds by Direct Interface Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14),; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For target compounds not listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99 (Reapproved 2004), Standard Test Method for Determination of Gaseous Organic Compounds by Direct Interface Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14), but potentially detected by mass spectrometry, the additional system continuing calibration check after each run, as detailed in ASTM D6420-99 (Reapproved 2004), Section 10.5.3, must be followed, met, documented, and submitted with the data report, even if there is no moisture condenser used or the compound is not considered water-soluble.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a principal component of the uncontrolled or inlet gas stream to the control device is formaldehyde, you may use EPA Method 316 of appendix A of this part instead of EPA Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, for measuring the formaldehyde. If formaldehyde is the predominant organic HAP in the inlet gas stream, you may use EPA Method 316 alone to measure formaldehyde either at the inlet and outlet of the control device using the formaldehyde control efficiency as a surrogate for total organic HAP or TOC efficiency, or at the outlet of a combustion device for determining compliance with the emission concentration limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You may not conduct performance tests during periods of SSM, as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To determine the HAP content of the organic liquid, you may use EPA Method 311 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, or other method approved by the Administrator. In addition, you may use other means, such as voluntary consensus standards, material safety data sheets (MSDS), or certified product data sheets, to determine the HAP content of the organic liquid. If the method you select to determine the HAP content provides HAP content ranges, you must use the upper end of each HAP content range in determining the total HAP content of the organic liquid. The EPA may require you to test the HAP content of an organic liquid using EPA Method 311 or other method approved by the Administrator. If the results of the EPA Method 311 (or any other approved method) are different from the HAP content determined by another means, the EPA Method 311 (or approved method) results will govern.
