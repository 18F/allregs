                            <p class="depth0">Section 112 of the Act provides that the Act shall apply only to  those consumer products manufactured after July 4, 1975. When a consumer  purchases repair of a consumer product the date of manufacture of any  replacement parts used is the measuring date for determining coverage  under the Act. The date of manufacture of the consumer product being  repaired is in this instance not relevant. Where a consumer purchases or  obtains on an exchange basis a rebuilt consumer product, the date that  the rebuilding process is completed determines the Act's applicability.
