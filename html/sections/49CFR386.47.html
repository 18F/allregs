                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. At the hearing, any part or all of a deposition, so  far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used against any  party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or  who had due notice thereof in accordance with any one of the following  provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of  contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The deposition of expert witnesses, particularly the deposition  of physicians, may be used by any party for any purpose, unless the  Assistant Administrator or administrative law judge rules that such use  would be unfair or a violation of due process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking  the deposition was an officer, director, or duly authorized agent of a  public or private organization, partnership, or association which is a  party, may be used by any other party for any purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used  by any party for any purpose if the presiding officer finds:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the witness is dead; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the witness is out of the United States or more than 100  miles from the place of hearing unless it appears that the absence of  the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the witness is unable to attend to testify because of  age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That the party offering the deposition has been unable to  procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances  exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due  regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally  in open hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party,  any other party may require him or her to introduce all of it which is  relevant to the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other  parts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Objections to admissibility. Except as provided in this  paragraph, objection may be made at the hearing to receiving in evidence  any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the  exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and  testifying.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency,  relevancy or materiality of testimony are not waived by failure to make  them before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the ground of  the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if  presented at that time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in  the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or  answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties and  errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed, or cured if  promptly presented, are waived unless reasonable objection thereto is  made at the taking of the deposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Objections to the form or written interrogatories are waived  unless served in writing upon the party propounding them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of taking using depositions. A party shall not be deemed  to make a person his or her own witness for any purpose by taking his or  her deposition. The introduction in evidence of the deposition or any  part thereof for any purpose other than that of contradicting or  impeaching the deponent makes the deponent the witness of the party  introducing the deposition, but this shall not apply to the use by any  other party of a deposition as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this  section. At the hearing, any party may rebut any relevant evidence  contained in a deposition whether introduced by him or her or by any  other party.</p>
