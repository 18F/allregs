No Department shall be obligated  to pay royalties unless the contract is signed on behalf of such  Department. Accordingly, the License Grant clause at 252.227-7006 should  be limited to the practice of the invention by or for the signatory  Department or Departments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> License term--running royalty. The clause at 252.227-7007 is a  sample form for expressing the license term.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Computation of royalties. The clause at 252.227-7008 providing  for the computation of royalties, may be of varying scope depending upon  the nature of the royalty bearing article, the volume of procurement,  and the type of contract pursuant to which the procurement is to be  accomplished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reporting and payment of royalties. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contract should  contain a provision specifying the office designated within the specific  Department involved to make any necessary reports to the contractor of  the extent of use of the licensed subject matter by the entire  Department, and such office shall be charged with the responsibility of  obtaining from all procuring offices of that Department the information  necessary to make the required reports and corresponding vouchers  necessary to make the required payments. The clause at 252.227-7009 is a  sample for expressing reporting and payment of royalties requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where more than one Department or Government Agency is licensed  and there is a ceiling on the royalties payable in any reporting period,  the licensing Departments or Agencies shall coordinate with respect to  the pro rata share of royalties to be paid by each.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> License to other government agencies. When it is intended that a  license on the same terms and conditions be available to other  departments and agencies of the Government, the clause at 252.227-7010  is an example which may be used.</p>
