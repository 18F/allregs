                            <p class="depth0">516.1 Insulation and Glazing. The insulation and glazing  characteristics of the Prototype and Reference Building envelope shall  be determined by using the first column under ``Base Case'', with no  assumed overhangs, for the appropriate Alternate Component Tables (ACP)  in Table 402.4.1.2, as defined by climate range. The insulation and  glazing characteristics from this ACP are prescribed assumptions for  Prototype and Reference Buildings for calculating the Energy Cost  Budget. In calculating the Design Energy Consumption of the Proposed  Design, the envelope characteristics of the Proposed Design shall be  used.</p><p class="depth0">516.2 Infiltration. For Prototype and Reference Buildings, the  infiltration assumptions in subsection 516.2.1 shall be prescribed  assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budget and default  assumptions for the Design Energy Consumption. Infiltration shall impact  perimeter zones only.</p><p class="depth0">516.2.1 When the HVAC system is switched ``on,'' no infiltration  shall be assumed. When the HVAC system is switched ``off,'' the  infiltration rate for buildings with or without operable windows shall  be assumed to be 0.038 cfm/ft\2\ of gross exterior wall. Hotels/motels  and multi-family high-rise residential buildings shall have infiltration  rates of 0.038 cfm/ft\2\ of gross exterior wall area at all times.</p><p class="depth0">516.3 Envelope and Ground Absorptivities. For Prototype and  Reference Buildings, absorptivity assumptions shall be prescribed  assumptions for computing the Energy Cost Budget and default assumptions  for computing the Design Energy Consumption. The solar absorptivity of  opaque elements of the building envelope is assumed to be 70%. The solar  absorptivity of ground surfaces is assumed to be 80% (20% reflectivity).</p><p class="depth0">516.4 Window Management. For the Prototype and Reference Building,  window management drapery assumptions shall be prescribed assumptions  for setting the Energy Cost Budget. No draperies shall be the default  assumption for computing the Design Energy Consumption. Glazing is  assumed to be internally shaded by medium-weight draperies, closed one- half time. The   draperies shall be modeled by assuming that one-half the area in each  zone is draped and one-half is not. If manually-operated draperies,  shades, or blinds are to be used in the Proposed Design, the Design  Energy Consumption shall be calculated by assuming they are effective  over one-half the glazing area in each zone.</p><p class="depth0">516.5 Shading. For Prototype and Reference buildings and the  Proposed Design, shading by permanent structures, terrain, and  vegetation shall be taken into account for computing energy consumption,  whether or not these features are located on the building site. A  permanent fixture is one that is likely to remain for the life of the  Proposed Design.</p>
