An applicant shall use the methodology provided in  appendix C to this part for guided orbital or suborbital expendable  launch vehicles and appendix D for unguided suborbital launch vehicles.  The FAA will approve an alternate method if an applicant provides a  clear and convincing demonstration that its proposed method provides an  equivalent level of safety to that required by appendix C or D of this  part. For a reusable launch vehicle, an applicant must provide a clear  and convincing demonstration of the validity of its risk analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For licensed launches, the FAA will not approve the location of  the proposed launch point if the estimated expected casualty exceeds 30x  10-6.
