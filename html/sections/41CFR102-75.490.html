                            <p class="depth0">The disposal agency must notify eligible public agencies that  surplus property is available for educational and/or public health  purposes. The notice must require that any plans for an educational or  public health use, resulting from the development of the comprehensive  and coordinated plan of use and procurement for the property, must be  coordinated with the Department of Education (ED) or the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), as appropriate. The notice must also  let eligible public agencies know where to obtain the applications,  instructions for preparing them, and where to submit the application.  The requirement for educational or public health use of the property by  an eligible public agency is contingent upon the disposal agency's  approval, under Sec. 102-75.515, of a recommendation for assignment of  Federal surplus real property received from ED or HHS. Further, any  subsequent transfer is subject to the approval of the head of the  disposal agency as stipulated under 40 U.S.C. 550(c) or (d) and  referenced in Sec. 102-75.535.</p>
