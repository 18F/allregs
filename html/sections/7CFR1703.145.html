If such priority is achieved, RUS will process the loan application on a first-in, first-out basis, provided that the total amount of applications on-hand for loans does not exceed 90 percent of the total loan funding available for the fiscal year. At such time as the total amount of applications eligible for loans, if such applications were approved, exceeds 90 percent of amount of loan funding available, RUS will process the remaining applications using the evaluation criteria set forth in Sec. 1703.126.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A loan will not be approved if it is determined that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant's proposal does not indicate financial feasibility, or is not adequately secured in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1703.144(d);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant's proposal indicates technical flaws, which, in the opinion of RUS, would prevent successful implementation, or operation of the project; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any other aspect of the applicant's proposal fails to adequately address any requirements of this subpart or contains inadequacies which would, in the opinion of RUS, undermine the ability of the project to meet the general purpose of this subpart or comply with policies of the DLT program contained in Sec. 1703.101.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> RUS will provide the applicant with a statement of any determinations made with regard to paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section.

If, in the opinion of the Administrator, the applicant fails to adequately respond to any determinations or other findings made by the Administrator, the loan will not be approved, and the applicant will be notified of this determination. If the applicant does not agree with this finding an appeal may be filed in accordance with Sec. 1703.147.
