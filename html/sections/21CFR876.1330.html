                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A prescription, single-use ingestible capsule  designed to acquire video images during natural propulsion through the  digestive system. It is specifically designed to visualize the colon for  the detection of polyps. It is intended for use only in patients who had  an incomplete optical colonoscopy with adequate preparation, and a  complete evaluation of the colon was not technically possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special  controls for this device are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The capsule must be demonstrated to be biocompatible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Non-clinical testing data must demonstrate the mechanical and  functional integrity of the device under physically stressed conditions.  The following performance characteristics must be tested and detailed  protocols must be provided for each test:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Bite test to ensure that the capsule can withstand extreme cases  of biting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> pH resistance test to evaluate integrity of the capsule when  exposed to a range of pH values.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Battery life test to demonstrate that the capsule's operating  time is not constrained by the battery capacity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Shelf-life testing to demonstrate that the device performs as  intended at the proposed shelf-life date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Optical testing to evaluate fundamental image quality  characteristics such as resolution, field of view, depth of field,  distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, uniformity, and image artifacts. A  test must be performed to evaluate the potential of scratches, caused by  travelling through the gastrointestinal tract, on the transparent window  of the capsule and their impact on the optical and color performance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> An optical safety analysis must be performed based on maximum  (worst-case) light exposure to internal gastrointestinal mucosa, and  covering ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared ranges, as appropriate.  A mitigation analysis must be provided.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A color performance test must be provided to compare the color  differences between the input scene and output image.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The video viewer must clearly present the temporal or spatial  relationship between any two frames as a real-time lapse or a travel  distance. The video viewer must alert the user when the specific video  interval is captured at a frame rate lower than the nominal one due to  communication errors.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> A performance test evaluating the latency caused by any  adaptive algorithm such as adjustable frame rate must be provided.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> If the capsule includes a localization module, a localization  performance test must be performed to verify the accuracy and precision  of locating the capsule position within the colon.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> A data transmission test must be performed to verify the  robustness of the data transmission between the capsule and the  recorder. Controlled signal attenuation should be included for  simulating a non-ideal environment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Software validation, verification, and hazards analysis must  be provided.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> Electrical equipment safety, including thermal and mechanical  safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing must be  performed. If the environments of intended use include locations outside  of hospitals and clinics, appropriate higher immunity test levels must  be used. Labeling must include appropriate EMC information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiv)</em> Information demonstrating immunity from wireless hazards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The clinical performance characteristics of the device for the  detection of colon polyps must be established. Demonstration of the  performance characteristics must include assessment of positive percent  agreement and negative percent agreement compared to a clinically  acceptable alternative structural imaging method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Clinician labeling must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Specific instructions and the clinical and technical expertise  needed for the safe use of the device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A detailed summary of the clinical testing pertinent to use of  the device, including the percentage of patients in which a polyp was  correctly identified by capsule endoscopy, but also the percent of  patients in which the capsule either missed or falsely identified a  polyp with respect to the clinically acceptable alternative structural  imaging method.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The colon cleansing procedure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A detailed summary of the device technical parameters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A detailed summary of the device- and procedure-related  complications pertinent to use of the device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> An expiration date/shelf life.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Patient labeling must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An explanation of the device and the mechanism of operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Patient preparation procedure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A brief summary of the clinical study. The summary should not  only include the percentage of patients in which a polyp was correctly  identified by capsule endoscopy, but also the percent of patients in  which the capsule either missed or falsely identified a polyp with  respect to the clinically acceptable alternative structural imaging  method.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A summary of the device- and procedure-related complications  pertinent to use of the device.
