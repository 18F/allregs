                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 701(e) of the FA Act and section 304(c) of the Safety  Act preclude the use or admission into evidence of Board accident  reports in any suit or action for damages arising from accidents. These  sections reflect Congress' ``strong * * * desire to keep the Board free  of the entanglement of such suits.'' Rep. No. 93-1192, 93d Cong., 2d  Sess., 44 (1974), and serve to ensure that the Board does not exert an  undue influence on litigation. The purposes of these sections would be  defeated if expert opinion testimony of Board employees, which may be  reflected in the views of the Board expressed in its reports, were  admitted in evidence or used in litigation arising out of an accident.  The Board relies heavily upon its investigators' opinions in its  deliberations. Furthermore, the use of Board employees as experts to  give opinion testimony would impose a significant administrative burden  on the Board's investigative staff. Litigants must obtain their expert  witnesses from other sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the reasons stated in paragraph (a) of this section and  Sec. 835.1, Board employees may only testify as to the factual  information they obtained during the course of an investigation,  including factual evaluations embodied in their factual accident  reports. However, they shall decline to testify regarding matters beyond  the scope of their investigation, and they shall not give any expert or  opinion testimony.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Board employees may testify about the firsthand information they  obtained during an investigation that is not reasonably available  elsewhere, including observations recorded in their own factual accident  reports. Consistent with the principles cited in Sec. 835.1 and this  section, current Board employees are not authorized to testify regarding  other employee's reports, or other types of Board documents, including  but not limited to safety recommendations, safety studies, safety  proposals, safety accomplishments, reports labeled studies, and analysis  reports, as they contain staff analysis and/or Board conclusions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Briefs of accidents may be released in conjunction with factual  accident reports. Nevertheless, they are not part of those reports and  are not to be admitted in evidence or used in a deposition approved  under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Not all material in a factual accident report may be the subject  of testimony. The purpose of the factual accident report, in great part,  is to inform the public at large, and as a result the factual accident  report may contain information and conclusions for which testimony is  prohibited by this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No employee may testify in any matter absent advance approval by  the General Counsel as provided in this part.  [55 FR 41541, Oct. 12, 1990, as amended at 63 FR 71607, Dec. 29, 1998;  64 FR 5622, Feb. 4, 1999]</p>
