                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applications filed. Application under the Act of February 15,  1901, or the Act of March 4, 1911, for permission to use the desired  right-of-way through National Park Service areas must be filed and  approved before any rights can be claimed thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required showings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the plant or connecting  generating plants which generate the power to be transmitted over such  line, such description to be in sufficient detail to show, to the  satisfaction of the authorized officer, the character, capacity, and  location of such plants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the transmission line of which the line for  which a right-of-way is requested forms a part, giving in reasonable  detail the points between which it will extend, its characteristics and  purpose. There must also be included a statement as to the voltage for  which the line is designed and at which it is to be operated initially,  and a statement as to whether it is to serve a single customer, or a  number of customers, or is intended to transmit power solely for the  applicant's use. If the line is to serve a single customer or is for the  applicant's own use, the nature of such use must be given (such as  airway beacon, coal mine, and irrigation pumps).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The application and maps shall specify the width of the right- of-way desired. Rights-of-way for power lines will be limited to 50 feet  on each side of the centerline unless sufficient justification is  furnished for a greater width and it is otherwise authorized by law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the line is to have a nominal voltage of 66 kilovolts or  more, the application should include a one-line diagram of the proposed  line and the immediate interconnecting facilities including power plants  and substations, a power flow diagram for proposed line and connecting  major lines showing conditions under normal use, and typical structure  drawings of proposed line showing construction dimensions and list of  materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any application under the Act of March 4, 1911, for a line  right-of-way in excess of 100 feet in width or for a structure or  facility right-of-way over 10,000 square feet must state the reasons why  the larger right-of-way is required. Rights-of-way will not be issued in  excess of such sizes in the absence of a satisfactory showing of the  need therefor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A detailed description of the environmental impact of the  project shall be included with the application. It shall provide, among  other things, information about the impact of the project on airspace,  air and water quality, scenic and esthetic features, historical and  archeological features, and wildlife, fish, and marine life.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proposed site, design, and construction of the project  shall be consistent with the ``Environmental Criteria for Electric  Transmission Lines,'' prescribed jointly by the Secretary of  Agriculture, as well as such other environmental criteria and guidelines  as the National Park Service shall from time to time prescribe.  ``Environmental Criteria for Electric Transmission Systems'' is  available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing  Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If all other requirements are met, the application may be  approved if it is determined that the beneficial purposes and effects of  the project will not be outweighed by an adverse environmental impact.  If the authorized officer determines that the application cannot be  approved as proposed, he will, whenever possible, suggest alternative  routes or methods of construction, or other modifications which if  adopted by the applicant would make the application acceptable.</p>
