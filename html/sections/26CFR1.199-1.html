                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> for any taxable year cannot  exceed 50 percent of the W-2 wages of the employer for the taxable year  (as determined under Sec. 1.199-2). The provisions of this section  apply solely for purposes of section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Taxable income and adjusted gross income--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For  purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the definition of taxable  income under section 63 applies, except that taxable income (or  alternative minimum taxable income, if applicable) is determined without  regard to section 199 and without regard to any amount excluded from  gross income pursuant to section 114 or pursuant to section 101(d) of  the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Public Law 108-357 (118 Stat.  1418) (Act). In the case of individuals, adjusted gross income for the  taxable year is determined after applying sections 86, 135, 137, 219,  221, 222, and 469, and without regard to section 199 and without regard  to any amount excluded from gross income pursuant to section 114 or  pursuant to section 101(d) of the Act. For purposes of determining the  tax imposed by section 511, paragraph (a) of this section is applied  using unrelated business taxable income. Except as provided in Sec.  1.199-7(c)(2), the deduction under section 199 is not taken into account  in computing any net operating loss or the amount of any net operating  loss carryback or carryover.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. X, a corporation that is not part of an expanded  affiliated group (EAG) (as defined in Sec. 1.199-7), engages in  production activities that generate QPAI and taxable income (without  taking into account the deduction under this section and an NOL  deduction) of $600 in 2010. During 2010, X incurs W-2 wages as defined  in Sec. 1.199-2(e) of $300. X has an NOL carryover to 2010 of $500. X's  deduction under this section for 2010 is $9 (.09 x (lesser of QPAI of  $600 and taxable income of $100 ($600 taxable income--$500 NOL)).  Because the wage limitation is $150 (50% x $300), X's deduction is not  limited.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X, a corporation that is not part of an EAG,  engages in production activities that generate QPAI and taxable income  (without taking into account the deduction under this section and an NOL  deduction) of $100 in 2010. X has an NOL carryover to 2010 of $500 that  reduces its taxable income for 2010 to $0. X's deduction under this  section for 2010 is $0 (.09 x (lesser of QPAI of $100 and taxable income  of $0)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Carryover to 2011. X's taxable income for purposes of  determining its NOL carryover to 2011 is $100. Accordingly, X's NOL  carryover to 2011 is $400 ($500 NOL carryover to 2010--$100 NOL used in  2010).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Qualified production activities income. QPAI for any taxable  year is an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the taxpayer's  domestic production gross receipts (DPGR) (as defined in Sec. 1.199-3)  over the sum of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost of goods sold (CGS) that is allocable to such receipts;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other expenses, losses, or deductions (other than the deduction  allowed under this section) that are properly allocable to such  receipts. See Sec. Sec. 1.199-3 and 1.199-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Allocation of gross receipts--(1) In general. A taxpayer must  determine the portion of its gross receipts for the taxable year that is  DPGR and the portion of its gross receipts that is non-DPGR.   Applicable Federal income tax principles apply to determine whether a  transaction is, in substance, a lease, rental, license, sale, exchange,  or other disposition the gross receipts of which may constitute DPGR  (assuming all the other requirements of Sec. 1.199-3 are met), whether  it is a service the gross receipts of which may constitute non-DPGR, or  some combination thereof. For example, if a taxpayer leases qualifying  production property (QPP) (as defined in Sec. 1.199-3(j)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1))</em> and in  connection with that lease, also provides services, the taxpayer must  allocate its gross receipts from the transaction using any reasonable  method that is satisfactory to the Secretary based on all of the facts  and circumstances and that accurately identifies the gross receipts that  constitute DPGR and non-DPGR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable method of allocation. Factors taken into  consideration in determining whether the taxpayer's method of allocating  gross receipts between DPGR and non-DPGR is reasonable include whether  the taxpayer uses the most accurate information available; the  relationship between the gross receipts and the method used; the  accuracy of the method chosen as compared with other possible methods;  whether the method is used by the taxpayer for internal management or  other business purposes; whether the method is used for other Federal or  state income tax purposes; the time, burden, and cost of using  alternative methods; and whether the taxpayer applies the method  consistently from year to year. Thus, if a taxpayer has the information  readily available and can, without undue burden or expense, specifically  identify whether the gross receipts derived from an item are DPGR, then  the taxpayer must use that specific identification to determine DPGR. If  a taxpayer does not have information readily available to specifically  identify whether the gross receipts derived from an item are DPGR or  cannot, without undue burden or expense, specifically identify whether  the gross receipts derived from an item are DPGR, then the taxpayer is  not required to use a method that specifically identifies whether the  gross receipts derived from an item are DPGR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> De minimis rules--(i) DPGR. All of a taxpayer's gross receipts  may be treated as DPGR if less than 5 percent of the taxpayer's total  gross receipts are non-DPGR (after application of the exceptions  provided in Sec. 1.199-3(i)(4)(i)(B), (l)(4)(iv)(A), (m)(1)(iii)(A),  (n)(6)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>, and (o)(2) that may result in gross receipts being treated as  DPGR). If the amount of the taxpayer's gross receipts that are non-DPGR  equals or exceeds 5 percent of the taxpayer's total gross receipts,  then, except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, the  taxpayer is required to allocate all gross receipts between DPGR and  non-DPGR in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If a  corporation is a member of an EAG, but is not a member of a consolidated  group, then the determination of whether less than 5 percent of the  taxpayer's total gross receipts are non-DPGR is made at the corporation  level. If a corporation is a member of a consolidated group, then the  determination of whether less than 5 percent of the taxpayer's total  gross receipts are non-DPGR is made at the consolidated group level. In  the case of an S corporation, partnership, trust (to the extent not  described in Sec. 1.199-5(d) or Sec. 1.199-9(d)) or estate, or other  pass-thru entity, the determination of whether less than 5 percent of  the pass-thru entity's total gross receipts are non-DPGR is made at the  pass-thru entity level. In the case of an owner of a pass-thru entity,  the determination of whether less than 5 percent of the owner's total  gross receipts are non-DPGR is made at the owner level, taking into  account all gross receipts of the owner from its other trade or business  activities and the owner's share of the gross receipts of the pass-thru  entity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> that may  result in gross receipts being treated as non-DPGR). If a corporation is  a member of an EAG, but is not a member of a consolidated group, then  the determination of whether less than 5 percent of the taxpayer's total  gross   receipts are DPGR is made at the corporation level. If a corporation is  a member of a consolidated group, then the determination of whether less  than 5 percent of the taxpayer's total gross receipts are DPGR is made  at the consolidated group level. In the case of an S corporation,  partnership, trust (to the extent not described in Sec. 1.199-5(d) or  Sec. 1.199-9(d)) or estate, or other pass-thru entity, the  determination of whether less than 5 percent of the pass-thru entity's  total gross receipts are DPGR is made at the pass-thru entity level. In  the case of an owner of a pass-thru entity, the determination of whether  less than 5 percent of the owner's total gross receipts are DPGR is made  at the owner level, taking into account all gross receipts of the owner  from its other trade or business activities and the owner's share of the  gross receipts of the pass-thru entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of  this paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth3">Example. X derives its gross receipts from the sale of gasoline  refined by X within the United States and the sale of refined gasoline  that X acquired by purchase from an unrelated person. If at least 5% of  X's gross receipts are derived from gasoline refined by X within the  United States (that qualify as DPGR if all the other requirements of  Sec. 1.199-3 are met) and at least 5% of X's gross receipts are derived  from the resale of the acquired gasoline (that do not qualify as DPGR),  then X does not qualify for the de minimis rules under paragraphs  (d)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, and X must allocate its gross  receipts between the gross receipts derived from the sale of gasoline  refined by X within the United States and the gross receipts derived  from the resale of the acquired gasoline. If less than 5% of X's gross  receipts are derived from the resale of the acquired gasoline, then, X  may either allocate its gross receipts between the gross receipts  derived from the gasoline refined by X within the United States and the  gross receipts derived from the resale of the acquired gasoline, or,  pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, X may treat all of its  gross receipts derived from the sale of the refined gasoline as DPGR. If  X's gross receipts attributable to the gasoline refined by X within the  United States constitute less than 5% of X's total gross receipts, then,  X may either allocate its gross receipts between the gross receipts  derived from the gasoline refined by X within the United States and the  gross receipts derived from the resale of the acquired gasoline, or,  pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, X may treat all of its  gross receipts derived from the sale of the refined gasoline as non- DPGR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certain multiple-year transactions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of historical data.  If a taxpayer recognizes and reports gross receipts from advance  payments or other similar payments on a Federal income tax return for a  taxable year, then the taxpayer's use of historical data in making an  allocation of gross receipts from the transaction between DPGR and non- DPGR may constitute a reasonable method. If a taxpayer makes allocations  using historical data, and subsequently updates the data, then the  taxpayer must use the more recent or updated data, starting in the  taxable year in which the update is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>  of this section for the factors taken into consideration in determining  whether the taxpayer's method is reasonable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. On December 1, 2007, X, a calendar year accrual method  taxpayer, sells for $100 a one-year computer software maintenance  agreement that provides for (i) computer software updates that X expects  to produce in the United States, and (ii) customer support services. At  the end of 2007, X uses a reasonable method that is satisfactory to the  Secretary based on all of the facts and circumstances to allocate 60% of  the gross receipts ($60) to the computer software updates and 40% ($40)  to the customer support services. X treats the $60 as DPGR in 2007. At  the expiration of the one-year agreement on November 30, 2008, no  computer software updates are provided by X. Pursuant to paragraph  (e)(1) of this section, because X used a reasonable method that is  satisfactory to the Secretary based on all of the facts and  circumstances to identify gross receipts as DPGR, X is not required to  make any adjustments to its 2007 Federal income tax return (for example,  by amended return) or in 2008 for the $60 that was properly treated as  DPGR in 2007, even though no computer software updates were provided  under the contract.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. X manufactures automobiles within the United States and  sells 5-year extended warranties to customers. The sales price of the  warranty is based on historical data that determines what repairs and  services are performed on an automobile during the 5-year period. X  sells the 5-year warranty to Y for $1,000 in 2007. Under X's method of  accounting, X recognizes warranty revenue when received. Using  historical data, X concludes that 60% of the gross receipts attributable  to a 5-year warranty will be derived from the sale of parts (QPP) that X  manufactures within the United States, and 40% will be derived from the  sale of purchased parts X did not manufacture and non-qualifying  services. X's method of allocating its gross receipts with respect to  the 5-year warranty between DPGR and non-DPGR is a reasonable method  that is satisfactory to the Secretary based on all of the facts and  circumstances. Therefore, X properly treats $600 as DPGR in 2007.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2 except that in  2009 X updates its historical data. The updated historical data show  that 50% of the gross receipts attributable to a 5-year warranty will be  derived from the sale of parts (QPP) that X manufactures within the  United States and 50% will be derived from the sale of purchased parts X  did not manufacture and non-qualifying services. In 2009, X sells a 5- year warranty for $1,000 to Z. Under all of the facts and circumstances,  X's method of allocation is still a reasonable method. Relying on its  updated historical data, X properly treats $500 as DPGR in 2009.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 2 except that Y pays  for the 5-year warranty over time ($200 a year for 5 years). Under X's  method of accounting, X recognizes each $200 payment as it is received.  In 2009, X updates its historical data and the updated historical data  show that 50% of the gross receipts attributable to a 5-year warranty  will be derived from the sale of QPP that X manufactures within the  United States and 50% will be derived from the sale of purchased parts X  did not manufacture and non-qualifying services. Under all of the facts  and circumstances, X's method of allocation is still a reasonable  method. When Y makes its $200 payment for 2009, X, relying on its  updated historical data, properly treats $100 as DPGR in 2009.
