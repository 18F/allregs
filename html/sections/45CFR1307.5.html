                            <p class="depth0">In order to compete for the opportunity to be awarded a five-year  grant, an agency must submit an application to the responsible HHS  official that demonstrates that it is the most qualified entity to  deliver a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start or Early Head Start  program. The application must address the criteria for selection listed  at section 641(d)(2) of the Act for Head Start. Any agency that has had  its Head Start or Early Head Start grant terminated for cause in the  preceding five years is excluded from competing in such competition for  the next five years. A Head Start or Early Head Start agency that has  had a denial of refunding, as defined in 45 CFR 1303.2, in the preceding  five years is also excluded from competing.</p>
