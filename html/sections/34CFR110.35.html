The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any other means authorized by law, including, but not limited to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the Act or these regulations; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or of these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ED limits any termination or refusal under Sec. 110.35(a)(1) to the particular recipient and to the particular program or activity ED finds in violation of the Act or these regulations. ED will not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity that does not receive Federal financial assistance from ED.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> ED takes no action under paragraph (a) of this section until--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ED has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act or with these regulations and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Thirty days have elapsed after the Secretary has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Secretary files a report if any action is taken under Sec. 110.35(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Secretary also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance from ED to a recipient if termination proceedings in Sec. 110.35(a)(1) are initiated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New Federal financial assistance from ED includes all assistance for which ED requires an application or

approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance from ED does not include increases in funding as a result of changed computation of formula awards or assistance approved prior to the initiation of termination proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ED does not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under Sec. 110.35(a)(1). A deferral may not continue for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and ED. A deferral may not continue for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.
