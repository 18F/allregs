                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this  section, each tank vessel must undergo drydock, internal structural, and  cargo tank internal examinations as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, vessels that  operate in salt water must be inspected in accordance with the intervals  set forth in table 31.10-21(a). Where table 31.10-21(a) indicates a 2.5  year examination interval, it means a vessel must undergo two  examinations within any five year period. No more than three years may  elapse between any two examinations.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30JY96.000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Vessels that operate in fresh water at least six months in every  12 month period since the last drydock examination must be examined in  accordance with the intervals set forth in table 31.10-21(b). Where  table 31.10-21(b) indicates a 2.5 year examination interval, it means a  vessel must undergo   two examinations within any five year period. No more than three years  may elapse between any two examinations. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30JY96.001</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> During each inspection or reinspection for certification, all  wing voids, rakes, cofferdams, and other void spaces on tank barges must  be opened and checked from on-deck for the presence of water or cargo  indicating hull damage or cargo tank leakage. If water or cargo is not  present, these spaces need not be gas freed, ventilated, cleaned, or  otherwise prepared for personnel entry. If water or cargo is present, an  internal structural examination may be required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If, during an internal structural examination, cargo tank  internal examination, or underwater survey, damage or deterioration to  the hull plating, structural members, or cargo tanks is discovered, the  Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, may require the vessel to be  drydocked or otherwise taken out of service to further assess the extent  of the damage and to effect permanent repairs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Vessels less than 15 years of age (except wooden hull vessels)  that are in salt water service with a 2.5 year drydock interval (as  indicated in table 31.10-21(a) of this section) or that are in fresh  water service with a five year drydock interval (as indicated in table  31.10-21(b) of this section) may be considered for an underwater survey  instead of alternate drydock examinations, provided the vessel is fitted  with an effective hull protection system. Vessel owners or operators  must apply to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, for approval of  underwater surveys instead of alternate drydock examinations for each  vessel. The application must include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The procedure to be followed in carrying out the underwater  survey.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The location where the underwater survey will be accomplished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The method to be used to accurately determine the diver location  relative to the hull.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The means that will be provided for examining through-hull  fittings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The means that will be provided for taking shaft bearing  clearances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The condition of the vessel, including the anticipated draft of  the vessel at the time of the survey.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A description of the hull protection system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Vessels otherwise qualifying under paragraph (d) of this  section, that are 15 years of age or older may be considered for  continued participation in or entry into the underwater survey program  on a case-by-case basis, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Before the vessel's next scheduled drydocking, the owner or  operator submits a request for participation or continued participation  to Commandant (CG-CVC);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> During the vessel's next drydocking after the request is  submitted, no appreciable hull deterioration is indicated as a result of  a complete set of hull gaugings; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The results of the hull gauging and the results of the Coast  Guard drydock examination together with the recommendation of the  Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, are submitted to Commandant (CG- CVC) for final approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Each vessel which has not met with the applicable examination  schedules in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section because it is on  a voyage, must undergo the required examinations upon completion of the  voyage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The Commandant (CG-CVC) may authorize extensions to the  examination intervals specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

The  number and specific locations of the gauging points shall be to the  satisfaction of the Officer in Charge of Marine Inspection (OCMI).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, within 60  days of the vessel's required compliance date the owner or operator  shall submit the following to the OCMI that issued the vessel's current  Certificate of Inspection:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The gauging survey results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An engineering analysis signed by a registered Professional  Engineer licensed by any state of the United States or the District of  Columbia, or signed by a Coast Guard-approved organization, that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Certifies the vessel's compliance with the minimum section  modulus and plating thickness requirements of subpart 32.59 of this  chapter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Proposes structural repairs and/or modifications that will  bring the vessel up to the required strength standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The vessel owner or operator shall keep a permanent copy of the  Coast Guard-approved gauging report available for inspection by the  OCMI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Instead of the submittals required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of  this section, current classification with the American Bureau of  Shipping or another recognized classification society, or a load line  certificate issued in accordance with the International Convention on  Load Lines or the International Voyage Load Line Act, may be submitted  as evidence of compliance with the requirements of this section.
