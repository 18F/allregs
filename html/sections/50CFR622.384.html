                            <p class="depth0">See Sec. 622.8 for general provisions regarding quota applicability  and closure and reopening procedures. See Sec. 622.369 for the  descriptions of the zones. This section provides quotas and specific  quota closure restrictions for coastal migratory pelagic fish. All  weights are in round and eviscerated weight combined, unless specified  otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> or (3). A fish is counted against the quota for  the area where it is caught, not where it is landed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> King mackerel--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Gulf migratory group. The Gulf migratory  group is divided into zones and subzones. The descriptions of the zones  and subzones are specified in Sec. 622.369(a). Quotas for the eastern  and western zones are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Eastern zone. The eastern zone is divided into subzones with  quotas as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Florida east coast subzone--1,102,896 lb (500,265 kg).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Florida west coast subzone--(1) Southern subzone. The hook-and- line quota is 551,448 lb (250,133 kg) and the run-around gillnet quota  is 551,448 lb (250,133 kg).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Northern subzone--178,848 lb (81,124 kg).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Western zone--1,071,360 lb (485,961 kg).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Atlantic migratory group. The Atlantic migratory group is  divided into northern and southern zones. The descriptions of the zones  are specified in Sec. 622.369(a). Quotas for the northern and southern  zones for the 2015-2016 fishing year and subsequent years are as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Northern zone--1,292,040 lb (586,059 kg). No more than 0.40  million lb (0.18 million kg) may be harvested by purse seines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Southern zone--2,587,960 lb (1,173,879 kg).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Quota transfers. North Carolina or Florida, in consultation  with the other states in their respective zones, may request approval  from the RA to transfer part or all of their respective zone's annual  commercial quota to the other zone. Requests for transfer of commercial  quota for king mackerel must be made by a letter signed by the principal  state official with marine fishery management responsibility and  expertise of the state requesting the transfer, or his/her previously  named designee. The letter must certify that all pertinent state  requirements have been met and identify the states involved and the  amount of quota to be transferred. For the purposes of quota closures as  described in Sec. 622.8, the receiving zone's quota will be the original  quota plus any transferred amount, for that fishing season only.  Landings associated with any transferred quota will be included in the  total landings for the Atlantic migratory group, which will be evaluated  relative to the total ACL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Within 10 working days following the receipt of the letter from  the state requesting the transfer, the RA shall notify the appropriate  state officials of the disposition of the request. In evaluating  requests to transfer a quota, the RA shall consider whether:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The transfer would allow the overall annual quota to be fully  harvested; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The transfer is consistent with the objectives of the FMP and  the Magnuson-Stevens Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The transfer of quota will be valid only for the fishing year  for which the request was made and does not permanently alter the quotas  specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transit provisions applicable in areas closed due to a quota  closure for king mackerel. A vessel with a valid commercial vessel  permit for king mackerel that has onboard king mackerel harvested in an  open area of the EEZ may transit through areas closed to the harvest of  king mackerel due to a quota closure, if fishing gear is appropriately  stowed. For the purpose of paragraph (b) of this section, transit means  direct and non-stop continuous course through the area. To be  appropriately stowed fishing gear means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A gillnet must be left on the drum. Any additional gillnets not  attached to the drum must be stowed below deck.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A rod and reel must be removed from the rod holder and stowed  securely on or below deck. Terminal gear (i.e., hook, leader, sinker,  flasher, or bait) must be disconnected and stowed separately from the  rod and reel. Sinkers must be disconnected from the down rigger and  stowed separately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Spanish mackerel--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Gulf migratory group. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Atlantic migratory group. The Atlantic migratory group is  divided into northern and southern zones. The descriptions of the zones  are specified in Sec. 622.369(b). The quota for the Atlantic migratory  group of Spanish mackerel is 3.33 million lb (1.51 million kg). Quotas  for the northern and southern zones are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Northern zone--662,670 lb (300,582 kg).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Southern zone--2,667,330 lb (1,209,881 kg).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Quota transfers. North Carolina or Florida, in consultation  with the other states in their respective zones, may request approval  from the RA to transfer part or all of their respective zone's annual  commercial quota to the other zone. Requests for transfer of commercial  quota for Spanish mackerel must be made by a letter signed by the  principal state official with marine fishery management responsibility  and expertise, or his/her previously named designee, for each state  involved. The letter must certify that all pertinent state requirements  have been met and identify the states involved and the amount of quota  to be transferred. For the purposes of quota closures as described in  Sec. 622.8, the receiving zone's quota will be the original quota plus  any transferred amount, for that fishing season only. Landings  associated with any transferred quota will be included in the total  landings for the Atlantic migratory group, which will be evaluated  relative to the total ACL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Within 10 working days following the receipt of the letter from  the states involved, the RA shall notify the appropriate state officials  of the disposition of the request.

For the 2014  fishing year, the stock quota for the Gulf migratory group of cobia in  the Gulf zone is 1,420,000 lb (644,101 kg). For the 2015 fishing year,  the stock quota is 1,450,000 lb (657,709 kg). For the 2016 fishing year  and subsequent fishing years, the stock quota is 1,500,000 lb (680,389  kg).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Florida east coast zone. The following quota applies to persons  who fish for cobia and sell their catch. The quota for the Gulf  migratory group of cobia in the Florida east coast zone is 70,000 lb  (31,751 kg).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Atlantic migratory group. The following quotas apply to persons  who fish for cobia and sell their catch. For the 2014 and 2015 fishing  years, the quota for the Atlantic migratory group of cobia is 60,000 lb  (27,216 kg). The quota for the 2016 fishing year and subsequent fishing  years is 50,000 lb (22,680 kg).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Restrictions applicable after a quota closure. (1) A person  aboard a vessel for which a commercial permit for king or Spanish  mackerel has been issued, as required under Sec. 622.370(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> or (3),  may not fish for king or Spanish mackerel in the EEZ or retain king or  Spanish mackerel in or from the EEZ under a bag or possession limit  specified in Sec. 622.382(a) for the closed species, migratory group,  zone, subzone, or gear, except as provided for under paragraph (e)(2) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A person aboard a vessel for which valid charter vessel/headboat  permits for Gulf coastal migratory pelagic fish or South Atlantic  coastal migratory pelagic fish and a valid commercial vessel permit for  king or Spanish mackerel have been issued may continue to retain fish  under a bag and possession limit specified in Sec. 622.382(a), provided  the vessel is operating as a charter vessel or headboat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The sale or purchase of king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, or  cobia of the closed species, migratory group, subzone, or gear type, is  prohibited, including any king or Spanish mackerel taken under the bag  limits, or cobia taken under the limited-harvest species possession  limit specified in Sec. 622.383(b). The prohibition on sale/purchase  during a closure for coastal migratory pelagic fish does not apply to  coastal migratory pelagic fish that were harvested, landed ashore, and  sold prior to the effective date of the closure and were held in cold  storage by a dealer or processor.
