                                Sec. 2635.605  Waiver or authorization permitting participation while

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Waiver. Where, as defined in Sec. 2635.603(b)(1)(i), an employee is engaged in discussions that constitute employment negotiations for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 208(a), the employee may participate personally and substantially in a particular matter that has a direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of a prospective employer only after receiving a written waiver issued under the authority of 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) or (b)(3). These waivers are described in Sec. 2635.402(d). See also subpart C of part 2640 of this chapter. For certain employees, a regulatory exemption under the authority of 18

U.S.C. 208(b)(2) may also apply (see subpart B of part 2640 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: An employee of the Department of Agriculture has had two telephone conversations with an orange grower regarding possible employment. They have discussed the employee's qualifications for a particular position with the grower, but have not yet discussed salary or other specific terms of employment. The employee is negotiating for employment within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 208(a) and Sec. 2635.603(b)(1)(i). In the absence of a written waiver issued under 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1), she may not take official action on a complaint filed by a competitor alleging that the grower has shipped oranges in violation of applicable quotas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authorization by agency designee. Where an employee is seeking employment within the meaning of Sec. 2635.603(b)(1) (ii) or (iii), a reasonable person would be likely to question his impartiality if he were to participate personally and substantially in a particular matter that has a direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of any such prospective employer. The employee may participate in such matters only where the agency designee has authorized his participation in accordance with the standards set forth in Sec. 2635.502(d).</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: Within the past month, an employee of the Education Department mailed her resume to a university. She is thus seeking employment with the university within the meaning of Sec. 2635.603(b)(1)(ii) even though she has received no reply. In the absence of specific authorization by the agency designee in accordance with Sec. 2635.502(d), she may not participate in an assignment to review a grant application submitted by the university.
