                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section sets forth the conditions and procedures for  revocation of the right of a supplier or other party to receive Medicare  payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> (1), (2), or (3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Basis for revocation. CMS may revoke the right of a supplier or  other party to receive Medicare payments if the supplier or other party,  after warning by CMS or the carrier--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Violates the terms of assignment in Sec. 424.55(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continues collection efforts or fails to refund moneys  incorrectly collected, in violation of the terms of assignment in  Sec. 424.55(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Executes or continues in effect a reassignment or power of  attorney or any other arrangement that seeks to obtain payment contrary  to the provisions of Sec. 424.80; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fails to furnish evidence necessary to establish its compliance  with the requirements of Sec. 424.80.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proposed revocation: Notice and opportunity for review. If CMS  proposes to revoke the right to payment in accordance with paragraph (c)  of this section, it will send the supplier or other party a written  notice that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> States the reasons for the proposed revocation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provides an opportunity for the supplier or other party to  submit written argument and evidence against the proposed revocation.  CMS usually allows 15 days from the date on the notice, but may extend  or reduce the time as circumstances require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Actual revocation: Timing, notice, and opportunity for hearing-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Timing. CMS determines whether to revoke after considering any  written argument or evidence submitted by the supplier or other party  or, if none is submitted, at the expiration of the period specified in  the notice of proposed revocation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice and opportunity for hearing. The notice of revocation  specifies--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The reasons for the revocation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the revocation is effective as of the date on the notice;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the supplier or other party may, within 60 days from the  date on the notice (or a longer period if the notice so specifies),  request an administrative hearing and may be represented by counsel or  other qualified representative.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That the carrier will withhold payment on any claims submitted  by the supplier or other party until the period for requesting a hearing  expires   or, if a hearing is requested, until the hearing officer issues a  decision;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> That if the hearing decision reverses the revocation, the  carrier will pay the supplier's or other party's claims; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> That if a hearing is not requested or the hearing decision  upholds the revocation, payment will be made to the beneficiary or to  another person or agency authorized to receive payment on his or her  behalf.
