                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The standards set forth in Sec. Sec.  1.930 through 1.936 of  this part apply to the compromise of debts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711.  VA may exercise such compromise authority when the amount of the debt  due, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, does  not exceed $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney  General.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise provided by law, when the principal balance of  a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs,  exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney  General, the authority to accept the compromise rests with the  Department of Justice (DOJ). If VA receives an offer to compromise any  debt in excess of $100,000, VA should evaluate the compromise offer  using the same factors as set forth in Sec.  1.931 of this part. If VA  believes the offer has   merit, it shall refer the debt to the Civil Division or other  appropriate division in DOJ using a Claims Collection Litigation Report  (CCLR). The referral shall include appropriate financial information and  a recommendation for the acceptance of the compromise offer. DOJ  approval is not required if VA decides to reject a compromise offer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The $100,000 limit in paragraph (b) of this section does not  apply to debts that arise out of participation in a VA loan program  under Chapter 37 of Title 38 of the U.S. Code. VA has unlimited  authority to compromise debts arising out of participation in a Chapter  37 loan program, regardless of the amount of the debt.  (Authority: 31 U.S.C. 3711; 38 U.S.C 501, 3720)  [69 FR 62198, Oct. 25, 2004]</p>
