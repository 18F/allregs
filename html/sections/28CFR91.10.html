                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope of boot camp program. Funding is appropriated in fiscal year 1995 to provide grants to states and multi-state compacts to plan, develop, construct and expand correctional boot camps for adults and juveniles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adult and juvenile boot camps, referred to as ``correctional boot camps,'' are programs that ``provide a structured environment for delivering non-traditional corrections programs to criminal offenders.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> With respect to this program, the mandates of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.) shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Eligibility. (1) Funding is available for both adult and juvenile boot camps. To be eligible for the funding of boot camps, states must comply with the general assurances in Sec. 91.3(b) or demonstrate steps taken toward compliance. While the majority of assurances are applicable to the adult correctional system, those states applying for grants for juvenile boot camps must include the juvenile system in the state comprehensive correctional plan and demonstrate how construction of the boot camp will make secure space available to house violent juvenile offenders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Funding is available for both adult and juvenile boot camps.

Recipients are also strongly encouraged to provide for an independent evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of the funded program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recipients will be required to cooperate with a national evaluation team throughout the planning and implementation process.

Grant funds cannot be used for operating costs. States will be required to show how operating expenses will be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Matching requirement. The federal share of a grant received may not exceed 75 percent of the costs of the proposed boot camp program described in the appoved application. The matching requirement can only be met through a hard cash match, and must be satisfied by the end of the project period; facility operating expenses may not be used to meet the match requirement for the construction project supported. Match may be made through grantee contribution of construction-related costs. A certification to that effect will be required of each recipient of grant funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Innovative boot camp programs. Jurisdictions are encouraged to explore the development of ``innovative'' boot camp programs which incorporate principles based on the accumulation of research and practical experience, and reflect sound and effective correctional practice.</p>
