                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An Owner may require Families to pay a security deposit in an  amount equal to one month's Gross Family Contribution. If a Family  vacates its unit, the Owner, subject to State and local laws, may  utilize the deposit as reimbursement for any unpaid rent or other amount  owed under the Lease. If the Family has provided a security deposit, and  it is insufficient for such reimbursement, the Owner may claim  reimbursement from HUD or the PHA, as appropriate, not to exceed an  amount equal to the remainder of one month's Contract Rent. Any  reimbursement under this section shall be applied first toward any  unpaid rent. If a Family vacates the unit owing no rent or other amount  under the Lease or if such amount is less than the amount of the  security deposit, the Owner shall refund the full amount or the unused  balance, as the case may be, to the Family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In those jurisdictions where interest is payable by the Owner on  security deposits, the refunded amount shall include the amount of  interest payable. All security deposit funds shall be deposited by the  Owner in a segregated bank account, and the balance of this account, at  all times, shall be equal to the total amount collected from tenants  then in occupancy, plus any accrued interest. The Owner shall comply  with all State and local laws regarding interest payments on security  deposits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Families shall be expected to obtain the funds to pay security  and utility deposits, if required, from their own resources and/or other  private or public sources.</p>
