                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Review restrictions. SBA does not review loans made by an ILP  Intermediary under this program before approval of the loan by the ILP  Intermediary. The ILP Intermediary is responsible for all loan decisions  regarding eligibility (including size).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subsequent review. SBA will periodically review loans made by an  ILP Intermediary after approval of the loan by the ILP Intermediary as  part of the on-site and off-site reviews described in Sec. 109.510. If  SBA discovers that an ILP Intermediary has made a loan under this  program to an ineligible business or for an ineligible purpose, SBA will  require the ILP Intermediary to refinance the ineligible loan with non- ILP program funds and to deposit into its ILP Relending Fund an amount  equal to the outstanding principal balance on the ineligible loan.</p>
