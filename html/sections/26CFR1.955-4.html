                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Designation by Executive order. For purposes of sections 951  through 964, the term ``less developed country'' means any foreign  country (other than an area within the Sino-Soviet bloc) or any  possession of the United States with respect to which, on the first day  of the foreign corporation's taxable year, there is in effect an  Executive order by the President of the United States designating such  country or possession as an economically less developed country for  purposes of such sections. Each territory, department, province, or  possession of any foreign country other than a country within the Sino- Soviet bloc may be treated as a separate foreign country for purposes of  such designation if the territory, department, province, or possession  is overseas from the country of which it is a territory, department,  province, or possession. Thus, for example, an overseas possession of a  foreign country may be designated by Executive order as an economically  less developed country even though the foreign country itself has not  been designated as an economically less developed country; or the  foreign country may be so designated even though the overseas  possessions of such country have not been designated as economically  less developed countries. The term ``possession of the United States'',  for purposes of section 955(c)(3) and this section, shall be construed  to have the same meaning as that contained in paragraph (b)(2) of  Sec. 1.957-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Countries not eligible for designation. Section 955(c)(3)  provides that no designation by Executive order may be made under  section 955(c)(3) and paragraph (a) of this section with respect to--  Australia Austria Belgium CanadaDenmark France Germany (Federal Republic) Hong Kong Italy Japan Liechtenstein Luxembourg Monaco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Union of South Africa San Marino Sweden Switzerland United Kingdom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of  Sec. 1.955-2 for the effect of a termination of a Presidential  designation upon property which would be a qualified investment in a  less developed country but for the fact of such termination.
