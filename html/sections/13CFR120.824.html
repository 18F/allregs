                            <p class="depth0">A CDC must have full-time professional management, including an Executive Director (or the equivalent) managing daily operations. It must also have a full-time professional staff qualified by training and experience to market the 504 Program, package and process loan applications, close loans, service, and, if authorized by SBA, liquidate the loan portfolio, and sustain a sufficient level of service and activity in the Area of Operations. CDCs may obtain, under written contract, management, marketing, packaging, processing, closing, servicing or liquidation services provided by qualified individuals and entities under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The CDC must have at least one salaried professional employee that is employed directly (not a contractor or an Associate of a contractor) full-time to manage the CDC. The CDC manager must be hired by the CDC's board of directors and subject to termination only by the board. A CDC may petition SBA to waive the requirement of the manager being employed directly if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Another non-profit entity that has the economic development of the CDC's Area of Operations as one of its

principal activities will contribute the management of the CDC, and the management contributed by the other entity also may work on and operate that entity's economic development programs, but must be available to small businesses interested in the 504 program and to 504 loan borrowers during regular business hours; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The CDC petitioning SBA for such waiver is rural; has insufficient loan volume to justify having management employed directly by the CDC; and has contracted with another CDC located in the same general area to provide the management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> SBA must pre-approve contracts the CDC makes for managing, marketing, packaging, processing, closing, servicing, or liquidation functions. (CDCs may contract for legal and accounting services without SBA approval, except for legal services in connection with loan liquidation or litigation.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracts must clearly identify terms and conditions satisfactory to SBA that permit the CDC to terminate the contract prior to its expiration date on a reasonable basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The CDC must provide copies of these contracts to SBA for review annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a CDC's Board believes that it is in the best interest of the CDC to contract for a management, marketing, packaging, processing, closing, servicing or liquidation function, the CDC's Board must explain its reasoning to SBA. The CDC's Board must demonstrate to SBA that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The compensation under the contract is only from the CDC, reasonable and customary for similar services in the Area of Operations, and is only for actual services performed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The full term of the contract (including options) is reasonable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The contract does not evidence any actual or apparent conflict of interest or self-dealing on the part of any of the CDC's officers, management, and staff, including members of the Board and any Loan Committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No contractor (under this section) or Associate of a contractor may be a voting or non-voting member of the CDC's Board.
