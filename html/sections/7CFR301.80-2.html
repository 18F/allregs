                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas. The  Deputy Administrator shall designate as regulated areas, in a  supplemental regulation designated as Sec. 301.80-2a, each quarantined  State, or each portion thereof in which witchweed has been found or in  which there is reason to believe that witchweed is present or which it  is deemed necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation  or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested  localities. The Deputy Administrator, in the supplemental regulation,  may designate any regulated area or portion thereof, as a suppressive  area or a generally infested area in accordance with the definitions  thereof in Sec. 301.80-1. Less than an entire quarantined State will be  designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator is of  the opinion that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or  regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the  regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are  imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under  this subpart; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated  area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of  witchweed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Temporary designation of regulated areas and suppressive or  generally infested areas. The Deputy Administrator or an authorized  inspector may temporarily designate any other premises in a quarantined  State as a regulated area and may designate the regulated area or  portions thereof as a suppressive or generally infested area, in  accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section  for designating such area, by serving written notice thereof   on the owner or person in possession of such premises, and thereafter  the interstate movement of regulated articles from such premises by any  person having notice of the designation shall be subject to the  applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such  premises shall be added to the list in Sec. 301.80-2a if a basis then  exists for their designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Termination of designation as a regulated area and a suppressive  or generally infested area. The Deputy Administrator shall terminate the  designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section of any area  designated as a regulated area or a suppressive or a generally infested  area when he determines that such designation is no longer required  under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The  Deputy Administrator or an inspector shall terminate the designation  provided for under paragraph (b) of this section of any premises  designated as a regulated area or a suppressive or a generally infested  area when he determines that such designation is no longer required  under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and  notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of  the premises.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exemption of articles from certification, permit, or other  requirements. The Deputy Administrator may, in a supplemental regulation  designated as Sec. 301.80-2b, list regulated articles or movements of  regulated articles which shall be exempt from the certification, permit,  or other requirements of this subpart under such conditions as he may  prescribe, if he finds that facts exist as to the pest risk involved in  the movement of such regulated articles which make it safe to so relieve  such requirements.
