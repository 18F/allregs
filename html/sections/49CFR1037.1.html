                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How determined--Accuracy of the weights used in determining the  quantity of grain and grain products received for transportation by  carriers and delivered by them to consignees being of primary and  fundamental importance, the use of estimated weights   based upon the cubical contents of the load and the test weight per  bushel of the grain and grain products, or otherwise, will not be  accepted. All shipments shall be carefully weighed by competent weighers  upon scales that are known to be accurate within the limits of tolerance  stated in scale specifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inspection of scales--Before weighing grain and grain products  to and from cars, the scale and all other facilities to be used must be  thoroughly inspected to ascertain whether they are in proper working  condition, necessary adjustments or repairs, if any required, must be  made, and an accurate and complete record thereof shall be entered at  the time of inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Shipping weights--Where the shipper weighs the grain or grain  products for shipment and a claim for loss and damage is subsequently  filed on that shipment, the shipper shall furnish the carrier with whom  the claim is filed certificates of weight showing car initials and  number; the kind of grain or grain products; the total scale weight; the  type and house number of the scale used; the number of drafts and weight  of each draft; the date and time of weighing; whether the weight is  official, board-of-trade, grain-exchange, State, or other supervised  weight; and the number of grain doors used. This information should be  furnished at the time the claim is filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Destination weights--Where the consignee weighs a shipment of  grain or grain products and a claim for loss and damage is subsequently  filed on the shipment, the consignee shall furnish the carrier with whom  the claim is filed certificates of weight showing the car initials and  number; the kind of grain or grain products; the total scale weight; the  type and house number of the scale used; the number of drafts and weight  of each draft, and the date and time of weighing; and whether the weight  is official, board-of-trade, grain-exchange, State, or other supervised  weight. This information should be furnished at the time the claim is  filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A difference in weights at origin and destination, both of which  are based on supervised scales, establishes prima facie that the loss  occurred in transit and that the railroad is liable. When a difference  in weights is based in part on an unsupervised weight, which  nevertheless, was accepted by the railroad as the basis for assessing  freight charges, such unsupervised weight in combination with a  supervised weight establishes prima facie that the loss occurred in  transit and the railroad is liable. When a difference in weights is  based in part on an unsupervised weight, with the above exception, a  prima facie case of railroad liability for loss in transit has not been  established. Such difference in weights is a factor, however, to be  considered in connection with other evidence that a clear-record car  arrived at destination with seals intact and unbroken or that the  shipper made a written complaint that any car placed for loading was  defective, in response to which the railroad filed a written report  after investigation of the complaint. See paragraph (c) of Sec.  1037.3.</p>
