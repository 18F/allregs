                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever, in performing the duties of conducting an evaluation,  a DOD commercial air carrier evaluator presents S&A; Form 110B, ``DOD  Commercial Air Carrier Evaluator's Credential,'' to the pilot in command  of an aircraft operated by the certificate holder, the evaluator must be  given free and uninterrupted access to the pilot's compartment of that  aircraft. However, this paragraph does not limit the emergency authority  of the pilot in command to exclude any person from the pilot compartment  in the interest of safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A forward observer's seat on the flight deck or forward  passenger seat with headset or speaker must be provided for use by the  evaluator while conducting en route evaluations. The suitability of the  location of the seat and the headset or speaker for use in conducting en  route evaluations is determined by the FAA.  [Doc. No. FAA-2003-15571, 68 FR 41218, July 10, 2003]</p>
