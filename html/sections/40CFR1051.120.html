                                Sec.  1051.120  What emission-related warranty requirements apply to me?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. You must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the new engine, including all parts of its emission-control system, meets two conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is designed, built, and equipped so it conforms at the time of sale to the ultimate purchaser with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is free from defects in materials and workmanship that may keep it from meeting these requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Warranty period. Your emission-related warranty must be valid for at least 50 percent of the vehicle's minimum useful life in kilometers or hours of engine operation (where applicable), or at least 30 months, whichever comes first. You may offer an emission-related warranty more generous than we require. The emission-related warranty for the engine may not be shorter than any published warranty you offer without charge for the engine. Similarly, the emission-related warranty for any component may not be shorter than any published warranty you offer without charge for that component. If a vehicle has no odometer, base warranty periods in this paragraph (b) only on the vehicle's age (in years). The warranty period begins when the engine is placed into service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Components covered. The emission-related warranty covers all components whose failure would increase an engine's emissions of any regulated pollutant, including components listed in 40 CFR part 1068, Appendix I, and components from any other system you develop to control emissions. The emission-related warranty covers these components even if another company produces the component. Your emission-related warranty does not cover components whose failure would not increase an engine's emissions of any regulated pollutant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limited applicability. You may deny warranty claims under this section if the operator caused the problem through improper maintenance or use, as described in 40 CFR 1068.115. You may ask us to allow you to exclude from your emission-related warranty certified vehicles that have been used significantly for competition, especially certified motorcycles that meet at least four of the criteria in Sec.  1051.620(b)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Owners manual. Describe in the owners manual the emission-related warranty provisions from this section that apply to the engine.
