                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The prohibitions defined in subparts C and D of this part 17  shall not apply to any activity involving endangered or threatened  wildlife which was held in captivity or in a controlled environment on  December 28, 1973: Provided,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the purposes of such holding were not contrary to the  purposes of the Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the wildlife was not held in the course of a commercial  activity.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. On January 25, 1974, a tourist buys a stuffed hawksbill  turtle (an endangered species listed since June, 1970), in a foreign  country. On December 28, 1973, the stuffed turtle had been on display  for sale. The tourist imports the stuffed turtle into the United States  on January 26, 1974. This is a violation of the Act since the stuffed  turtle was held for commercial purposes on December 28, 1973.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. On December 27, 1973 (or earlier), a tourist buys a  leopard skin coat (the leopard has been listed as endangered since March  1972) for his wife in a foreign country. On January 5, he imports it  into the United States. He has not committed a violation since on  December 28, 1973, he was the owner of the coat, for personal purposes,  and the chain of commerce had ended with the sale on the 27th. Even if  he did not finish paying for the coat for another year, as long as he  had possession of it, and he was not going to resell it, but was using  it for personal purposes, the Act does not apply to that coat.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. On or before December 28, 1973, a hunter kills a leopard  legally in Africa. He has the leopard mounted and imports it into the  United States in March 1974. The importation is not subject to the Act.  The hunter has not engaged in a commercial activity, even though he  bought the services of a guide, outfitters, and a taxidermist to help  him take, preserve, and import the leopard. This applies even if the  trophy was in the possession of the taxidermist on December 28, 1973.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. On January 15, 1974, a hunter kills a leopard legally in  Africa. He has the leopard mounted and imports it into the United States  in June 1974. This importation is a violation of the Act since the  leopard was not in captivity or a controlled environment on December 28,  1973.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Service officers or Customs officers may refuse to clear  endangered or threatened wildlife for importation into or exportation  from the United States, pursuant to Sec. 14.53 of this subchapter,  until the importer or exporter can demonstrate that the exemption  referred to in this section applies. Exempt status may be established by  any sufficient evidence, including an affidavit containing the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The affiant's name and address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification of the affiant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identification of the endangered or threatened wildlife which is  the subject of the affidavit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement by the affiant that to the best of his knowledge and  belief, the endangered or threatened wildlife which is the subject of  the affidavit was in captivity or in a controlled environment on  December 28, 1973, and was not being held for purposes contrary to the  Act or in the course of a commercial activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement by the affiant in the following language:</p><p class="depth3">The foregoing is principally based on the attached exhibits which,  to the best of my knowledge and belief, are complete, true and correct.  I understand that this affidavit is being submitted for the purpose of  inducing the Federal Government to recognize an exempt status regarding  (insert description of wildlife), under the Endangered Species Act of  1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543), and regulations promulgated thereunder, and  that any false statements may subject me to the criminal penalties of 18  U.S.C. 1001.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> As an attachment, records or other available evidence to show:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the wildlife in question was being held in captivity or in  a controlled environment on December 28, 1973;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The purpose for which the wildlife was being held; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The nature of such holding (to establish that no commercial  activity was involved).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This section applies only to wildlife born on or prior to  December 28, 1973. It does not apply to the progeny of any such wildlife  born after December 28, 1973.</p>
