                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Decreases due to voluntary lapses of policies issued before January 1, 1958. (1) Section 810(e) provides that if for any taxable year a life insurance company which meets the requirements of section 501(c)(9), other than the requirement of subparagraph (B) thereof, makes an election in the manner provided in section 810(e)(3) and paragraph (b) of this section, only 11\1/2\ percent of any decrease in life insurance reserves (as defined in section 801(b) and Sec. 1.801-4) attributable to the voluntary lapse on or after January 1, 1958, of any policy issued prior to that date shall be taken into account under section 810 (a) or (b) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.810-2 in determining the net increase or decrease in the sum of the items described in section 810(c) during the taxable year. In applying the preceding sentence, the decrease in the reserve for any policy shall be determined by reference to the amount of such reserve at the beginning of the taxable year, reduced by any amount allowable as a deduction under section 809(d)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 1.809-5 in respect of such policy by reason of such lapse. The election under section 810(e) shall be adhered to in computing the company's gain or loss from operation for the taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent taxable years, unless consent to revoke such election is obtained from the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 810(e) provides that if for any taxable year a life insurance company which meets the requirements of section 501(c)(9), other than the requirement of subparagraph (B) thereof, makes an election in the manner provided in section 810(e)(3) and paragraph (b) of this section, only 11\1/2\ percent of any decrease in life insurance reserves (as defined in section 801(b) and Sec. 1.801-4) attributable to the voluntary lapse on or after January 1, 1958, of any policy issued prior to that date shall be taken into account under section 810 (a) or (b) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.810-2 in determining the net increase or decrease in the sum of the items described in section 810(c) during the taxable year. In applying the preceding sentence, the decrease in the reserve for any policy shall be determined by reference to the amount of such reserve at the beginning of the taxable year, reduced by any amount allowable as a deduction under section 809(d)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 1.809-5 in respect of such policy by reason of such lapse. The election under section 810(e) shall be adhered to in computing the company's gain or loss from operation for the taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent taxable years, unless consent to revoke such election is obtained from the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application of the election provided under section 810(e) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example. For the taxable year 1960, M, a life insurance company which meets the requirements of section 501(c)(9), other than the requirement of subparagraph (B) thereof, makes the election under section 810(e). Assume the following facts with respect to a policy issued in 1955 which voluntarily lapsed during the taxable year:
(1) Life insurance reserve on January 1, 1960................       $600(2) Amount allowable as a deduction under sec. 809(d)(1).....        200(3) Decrease in life insurance reserves for sec. 810(e)              400</p><p class="depth3">purposes (item (1) minus item (2))..........................(4) Amount taken into account under sec. 810 (a) and (b) by           46</p><p class="depth3">reason of sec. 810(e) election (11 1/2%x$400)...............</p><p class="depth3">Under the provisions of section 810(e) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, M would include $46 as its life insurance reserve with respect to such policy under section 810(c)(1) at the beginning of the taxable year 1960 for purposes of determining the net increase or decrease in the sum of the items described in section 810(c) for the taxable year under section 810 (a) or (b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time and manner of making election. The election provided by section 810(e)(3) shall be made in a statement attached to the life insurance company's income tax return for the first taxable year for which the company desires the election to apply. The return and statement must be filed not later than the date prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable year. However, if the last day prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing a return for the first taxable year for which the company desires the election to apply falls before January 20, 1961, the election provided by section 810(e)(3) may be made for such year by filing the statement and an amended return for such taxable year (and all

subsequent taxable years for which returns have been filed) before April 21, 1961. The statement shall indicate that the company meets the requirements of section 501(c)(9), other than the requirement of subparagraph (B) thereof, and has made the election provided under section 810(e) and paragraph (a) of this section. The statement shall set forth the following information with respect to each policy described in paragraph (a) of this section which has voluntarily lapsed during such year:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Type of policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Date issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Date lapsed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reason for lapse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Policy reserve as of beginning of taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Deduction allowable under section 809(d)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 1.809-5 during taxable year by reason of lapse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Decrease in policy reserve for section 810(e) purposes (excess of (5) over (6)).
In addition, the statement shall set forth the total of the amounts referred to in subparagraph (7) of this paragraph with respect to all policies described in paragraph (a) of this section which have voluntarily lapsed during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope of election. An election made under section 810(e)(3) and paragraph (a) of this section shall be effective for the taxable year for which made and for all succeeding taxable years, unless consent to revoke the election is obtained from the Commissioner. However, for taxable years beginning prior to January 20, 1961, a company may revoke the election provided by section 810(e)(3) without obtaining consent from the Commissioner by filing, before April 21, 1961, a statement that the company desires to revoke such election. An amended return reflecting such revocation must accompany the statement for all taxable years for which returns have been filed with respect to such election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disallowance of carryovers from pre-1958 losses from operations. For any taxable year for which the election provided under section 810(e)(3) and paragraph (b) of this section is effective, the provisions of section 812(b)(1) and Sec. 1.812-4 shall not apply with respect to any loss from operations for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1958.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective date; cross reference. The provisions of section 810(e) (as in effect for such years) and this section apply only with respect to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970. For provisions relating to certain funded pension trusts applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, see section 501(c)(18) and the regulations thereunder.
