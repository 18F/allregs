Prohibit a credit union from, directly or indirectly, acquiring any interest in any business entity or financial institution, establishing or acquiring any additional branch office, or engaging in any new line of business, except as provided by Sec. 702.202(b)(1);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Restricting transactions with and ownership of CUSO.

Require the credit union to merge with another financial institution if one or more grounds exist for placing the credit union into conservatorship pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1786(h)(1)(F), or into liquidation pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1787(a)(3)(A)(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mandatory conservatorship, liquidation or action in lieu thereof--(1) Action within 90 days.

Take other corrective action, in lieu of conservatorship or liquidation, to better

achieve the purpose of this part, provided that the NCUA Board documents why such action in lieu of conservatorship or liquidation would do so, provided however, that other corrective action may consist, in whole or in part, of complying with the quarterly timetable of steps and meeting the quarterly net worth targets prescribed in an approved net worth restoration plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Renewal of other corrective action. A determination by the NCUA Board to take other corrective action in lieu of conservatorship or liquidation under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section shall expire after an effective period ending no later than 180 calendar days after the determination is made, and the credit union shall be immediately placed into conservatorship or liquidation under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii), unless the NCUA Board makes a new determination under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section before the end of the effective period of the prior determination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mandatory liquidation after 18 months--(i) Generally.
