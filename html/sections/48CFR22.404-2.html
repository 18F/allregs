                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The contracting officer must incorporate only the appropriate  wage determinations in solicitations and contracts and must designate  the work to which each determination or part thereof applies. The  contracting officer must not include project wage determinations in  contracts or options other than those for which they are issued. When  exercising an option to extend the term of a contract, the contracting  officer must select the most current wage determination(s) from the same  schedule(s) as the wage determination(s) incorporated into the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the wage determination is a general wage determination or a  project wage determination containing more than one rate schedule, the  contracting officer shall either include only the rate schedules that  apply to the particular types of construction (building, heavy, highway,  etc.) or include the entire wage determination and clearly indicate the  parts of the work to which each rate schedule shall be applied.  Inclusion by reference is not permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Wage and Hour Division has issued the following general  guidelines for use in selecting the proper schedule(s) of wage rates:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Building construction is generally the construction of sheltered  enclosures with walk-in access, for housing persons, machinery,  equipment, or supplies. It typically includes all construction of such  structures, installation of utilities and equipment (both above and  below grade level), as well as incidental grading, utilities and paving,  unless there is an established area practice to the contrary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Residential construction is generally the construction,  alteration, or repair of single family houses or apartment buildings of  no more than four (4) stories in height, and typically includes  incidental items such as site work, parking areas, utilities, streets  and sidewalks, unless there is an established area practice to the  contrary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Highway construction is generally the construction, alteration,  or repair of roads, streets, highways, runways, taxiways, alleys,  parking areas, and other similar projects that are not incidental to  building, residential, or heavy construction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Heavy construction includes those projects that are not properly  classified as either building, residential, or highway, and is of a  catch-all nature. Such heavy projects may sometimes be distinguished on  the basis of their individual characteristics, and separate schedules  issued (e.g., dredging, water and sewer line, dams, flood control,  etc.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the nature of a project is not clear, it is necessary to  look at additional factors, with primary consideration given to locally  established area practices. If there is any doubt as to the proper  application of wage rate schedules to the type or types of construction  involved, guidance shall be sought before the opening of bids, or  receipt of best and final offers, from the Administrator, Wage and Hour  Division. Further examples are contained   in Department of Labor All Agency Memoranda Numbers 130 and 131.  [53 FR 4935, Feb. 18, 1988, as amended at 66 FR 53480, Oct. 22, 2001]</p>
