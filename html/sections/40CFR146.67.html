The owner or operator shall assure that the injection pressure does not initiate fractures or propagate existing fractures in the confining zone, nor cause the movement of injection or formation fluids into a USDW.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Injection between the outermost casing protecting USDWs and the well bore is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The owner or operator shall maintain an annulus pressure that exceeds the operating injection pressure, unless the Director determines that such a requirement might harm the integrity of the well. The fluid in the annulus shall be noncorrosive, or shall contain a corrosion inhibitor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator shall maintain mechanical integrity of the injection well at all times.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Permit requirements for owners or operators of hazardous waste wells which inject wastes which have the potential to react with the injection formation to generate gases shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conditions limiting the temperature, pH or acidity of the injected waste; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedures necessary to assure that pressure imbalances which might cause a backflow or blowout do not occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The owner or operator shall install and use continuous recording devices to monitor: the injection pressure; the flow rate, volume, and temperature of injected fluids; and the pressure on the annulus between the tubing and the long string casing, and shall install and use:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Automatic alarm and automatic shut-off systems, designed to sound and shut-in the well when pressures and flow rates or other parameters approved by the Director exceed a range and/or gradient specified in the permit; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Automatic alarms, designed to sound when the pressures and flow rates or other parameters approved by the Director exceed a rate and/or gradient specified in the permit, in cases where the owner or operator certifies that a trained operator will be on-site at all times when the well is operating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If an automatic alarm or shutdown is triggered, the owner or operator shall immediately investigate and identify as expeditiously as possible the cause of the alarm or shutoff.
