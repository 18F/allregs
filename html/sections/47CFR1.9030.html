If the spectrum leasing arrangement involves only part of the  license area and/or part of the bandwidth covered by the license, the  unjust enrichment obligation will be apportioned as though the license  were being partitioned and/or disaggregated (see Sec. 1.2111(c) and  Sec. 24.714(c) of this chapter). * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A licensee that participates in the Commission's installment  payment program (see Sec. 1.2110(g)) may enter into a long-term de facto  transfer leasing arrangement without triggering unjust enrichment  obligations provided that the lessee would qualify for as favorable a  category of installment payments. A licensee using installment payment  financing that seeks to lease to an entity not meeting the eligibility  standards for as favorable a category of installment payments must make  full payment of the remaining unpaid principal and any unpaid interest  accrued through the effective date of the spectrum leasing arrangement  (see Sec. 1.2111(a)). * * *</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p>
