                                Sec. 199.2  Definitions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. In an effort to be as specific as possible as to the word and intent of CHAMPUS, the following definitions have been developed. While many of the definitions are general and some assign meaning to relatively common terms within the health insurance environment, others are applicable only to CHAMPUS; however, they all appear in this part solely for the purpose of the Program. Except when otherwise specified, the definitions in this section apply generally throughout this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specific definitions. Abortion. Abortion means the intentional termination of a pregnancy by artificial means done for a purpose other than that of producing a live birth. A spontaneous, missed or threatened abortion or termination of an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy are not included within the term ``abortion'' as used herein.</p><p class="depth0">Absent treatment. Services performed by Christian Science practitioners for a person when the person is physically present.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Technically, ``Absent Treatment'' is an obsolete term. The current Christian Science terminology is ``treatment through prayer and spiritual means,'' which is employed by an authorized Christian Science practitioner either with the beneficiary being present or absent. However, to be considered for coverage under CHAMPUS, the beneficiary must be present physically when a Christian Science service is rendered, regardless of the terminology used.</p><p class="depth0">Abuse. For the purposes of this part, abuse is defined as any practice that is

inconsistent with accepted sound fiscal, business, or professional practice which results in a CHAMPUS claim, unnecessary cost, or CHAMPUS payment for services or supplies that are: (1) Not within the concepts of medically necessary and appropriate care, as defined in this part, or (2) that fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care providers. The term ``abuse'' includes deception or misrepresentation by a provider, or any person or entity acting on behalf of a provider in relation to a CHAMPUS claim.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Unless a specific action is deemed gross and flagrant, a pattern of inappropriate practice will normally be required to find that abuse has occurred. Also, any practice or action that constitutes fraud, as defined by this part, would also be abuse.</p><p class="depth0">Abused dependent. An eligible spouse or child, who meets the criteria in Sec. 199.3 of this part, of a former member who received a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge or was dismissed from a Uniformed Service as a result of a court-martial conviction for an offense involving physical or emotional abuse or was administratively discharged as a result of such an offense, or of a member or former member who has had their entitlement to receive retired pay terminated because of misconduct involving physical or emotional abuse.</p><p class="depth0">Accidental injury. Physical bodily injury resulting from an external force, blow or fall, or the ingestion of a foreign body or harmful substance, requiring immediate medical treatment. Accidental injury also includes animal and insect bites and sunstrokes. For the purpose of CHAMPUS, the breaking of a tooth or teeth does not constitute a physical bodily injury.</p><p class="depth0">Active duty. Full-time duty in the Uniformed Services of the United States. It includes duty on the active list, full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance while in the active Military Service, at a school designated as a Service school by law or by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.</p><p class="depth0">Active duty member. A person on active duty in a Uniformed Service under a call or order that does not specify a period of 30 days or less.</p><p class="depth0">Activities of daily living. Care that consists of providing food (including special diets), clothing, and shelter; personal hygiene services; observation and general monitoring; bowel training or management (unless abnormalities in bowel function are of a severity to result in a need for medical or surgical intervention in the absence of skilled services); safety precautions; general preventive procedures (such as turning to prevent bedsores); passive exercise; companionship; recreation; transportation; and such other elements of personal care that reasonably can be performed by an untrained adult with minimal instruction or supervision. Activities of daily living may also be referred to as ``essentials of daily living''.</p><p class="depth0">Acupuncture. The practice of inserting needles into various body parts to pierce specific peripheral nerves for the production of counter-irritation to relieve the discomfort of pain, induce surgical anesthesia, or for other treatment purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Acupuncture is not covered by CHAMPUS.</p><p class="depth0">Adequate Medical Documentation, Medical Treatment Records. Adequate medical documentation contains sufficient information to justify the diagnosis, the treatment plan, and the services and supplies furnished. Under CHAMPUS, it is required that adequate and sufficient clinical records be kept by the health care provider(s) to substantiate that specific care was actually and appropriately furnished, was medically necessary and appropriate (as defined by this part), and to identify the individual(s) who provided the care. All procedures billed must be documented in the records. In determining whether medical records are adequate, the records will be reviewed under the generally acceptable standards such as the applicable Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards, the Peer Review Organization (PRO) standards (and the provider's state or local licensing requirements) and other requirements specified by this part. In general, the documentation requirements for a professional provider are

not less in the outpatient setting than the inpatient setting.</p><p class="depth0">Adequate medical documentation, mental health records. Adequate medical documentation provides the means for measuring the type, frequency, and duration of active treatment mechanisms employed and progress under the treatment plan. Under CHAMPUS, it is required that adequate and sufficient clinical records be kept by the provider to substantiate that specific care was actually and appropriately furnished, was medically or psychologically necessary (as defined by this part), and to identify the individual(s) who provided the care. Each service provided or billed must be documented in the records. In determining whether medical records are adequate, the records will be reviewed under the generally acceptable standards (e.g., the applicable JCAHO standards and the provider's state or local licensing requirements) and other requirements specified by this part. It must be noted that the psychiatric and psychological evaluations, physician orders, the treatment plan, integrated progress notes (and physician progress notes if separate from the integrated progress notes), and the discharge summary are the more critical elements of the mental health record. However, nursing and staff notes, no matter how complete, are not a substitute for the documentation of services by the individual professional provider who furnished treatment to the beneficiary. In general, the documentation requirements of a professional provider are not less in the outpatient setting than the inpatient setting. Furthermore, even though a hospital that provides psychiatric care may be accredited under the JCAHO manual for hospitals rather than the consolidated standards manual, the critical elements of the mental health record listed above are required for CHAMPUS claims.</p><p class="depth0">Adjunctive dental care. Dental care which is medically necessary in the treatment of an otherwise covered medical (not dental) condition, is an integral part of the treatment of such medical condition and is essential to the control of the primary medical condition; or, is required in preparation for or as the result of dental trauma which may be or is caused by medically necessary treatment of an injury or disease (iatrogenic).</p><p class="depth0">Admission. The formal acceptance by a CHAMPUS authorized institutional provider of a CHAMPUS beneficiary for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment of illness, injury, pregnancy, or mental disorder.</p><p class="depth0">Adopted child. A child taken into one's own family by legal process and treated as one's own child. In case of adoption, CHAMPUS eligibility begins as of 12:01 a.m. of the day of the final adoption decree.</p><p class="depth0">Note: There is no CHAMPUS benefit entitlement during any interim waiting period.</p><p class="depth0">All-inclusive per diem rate. The OCHAMPUS determined rate that encompasses the daily charge for inpatient care and, unless specifically excepted, all other treatment determined necessary and rendered as part of the treatment plan established for a patient, and accepted by OCHAMPUS.</p><p class="depth0">Allowable charge. The CHAMPUS-determined level of payment to physicians, other individual professional providers and other providers, based on one of the approved reimbursement methods set forth in Sec. 199.14 of this part. Allowable charge also may be referred to as the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable charge.</p><p class="depth0">Allowable cost. The CHAMPUS-determined level of payment to hospitals or other institutions, based on one of the approved reimbursement methods set fourth in Sec. 199.14 of this part. Allowable cost may also be referred to as the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable cost.</p><p class="depth0">Ambulance. A specially designed vehicle for transporting the sick or injured that contains a stretcher, linens, first aid supplies, oxygen equipment, and such lifesaving equipment required by state and local law, and that is staffed by personnel trained to provide first aid treatment.</p><p class="depth0">Ambulatory Payment Classifications (APCs). Payment of services under the TRICARE OPPS is based on grouping outpatient procedures and services into ambulatory payment classification groups based on clinical and resource homogeneity, provider concentration,

frequency of service and minimal opportunities for upcoding and code fragmentation. Nationally established rates for each APC are calculated by multiplying the APC's relative weight derived from median costs for procedures assigned to the APC group, scaled to the median cost of the APC group representing the most frequently provided services, by the conversion factor.</p><p class="depth0">Amount in dispute. The amount of money, determined under this part, that CHAMPUS would pay for medical services and supplies involved in an adverse determination being appealed if the appeal were resolved in favor of the appealing party. See Sec. 199.10 for additional information concerning the determination of ``amount in dispute'' under this part.</p><p class="depth0">Anesthesia services. The administration of an anesthetic agent by injection or inhalation, the purpose and effect of which is to produce surgical anesthesia characterized by muscular relaxation, loss of sensation, or loss of consciousness when administered by or under the direction of a physician or dentist in connection with otherwise covered surgery or obstetrical care, or shock therapy. Anesthesia services do not include hypnosis or acupuncture.</p><p class="depth0">Appealable issue. Disputed questions of fact which, if resolved in favor of the appealing party, would result in the authorization of CHAMPUS benefits, or approval as an authorized provider in accordance with this part. An appealable issue does not exist if no facts are in dispute, if no CHAMPUS benefits would be payable, or if there is no authorized provider, regardless of the resolution of any disputed facts. See Sec. 199.10 for additional information concerning the determination of ``appealable issue'' under this part.</p><p class="depth0">Appealing party. Any party to the initial determination who files an appeal of an adverse determination or requests a hearing under the provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Services performed in connection with the diagnosis or treatment of disease or injury, pregnancy, mental disorder, or well-baby care which are in keeping with the generally accepted norms for medical practice in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The authorized individual professional provider rendering the medical care is qualified to perform such medical services by reason of his or her training and education and is licensed or certified by the state where the service is rendered or appropriate national organization or otherwise meets CHAMPUS standards; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The services are furnished economically. For purposes of this part, ``economically'' means that the services are furnished in the least expensive level of care or medical environment adequate to provide the required medical care regardless of whether or not that level of care is covered by CHAMPUS.</p><p class="depth0">Approved teaching programs. For purposes of CHAMPUS, an approved teaching program is a program of graduate medical education which has been duly approved in its respective specialty or subspecialty by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education of the American Medical Association, by the Committee on Hospitals of the Bureau of Professional Education of the American Osteopathic Association, by the Council on Dental Education of the American Dental Association, or by the Council on Podiatry Education of the American Podiatry Association.</p><p class="depth0">Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs).

Assistive technology devices help an ECHO beneficiary overcome or remove a disability and are used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of an individual. Assistive technology devices may include non-medical devices but do not include any structural alterations (e.g., permanent structure of wheelchair ramps or alterations to street curbs) service animals (e.g., Seeing Eye dogs, hearing/handicapped assistance animals, etc.) or specialized equipment and devices whose

primary purpose is to enable the individual to engage in sports or recreational events. Assistive technology devices are authorized only under coverage criteria determined by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity to assist in the reduction of the disabling effects of a qualifying condition for individuals eligible to receive benefits under the ECHO program, as provided in Sec. 199.5.</p><p class="depth0">Attending physician. The physician who has the primary responsibility for the medical diagnosis and treatment of the patient. A consultant or an assistant surgeon, for example, would not be an attending physician. Under very extraordinary circumstances, because of the presence of complex, serious, and multiple, but unrelated, medical conditions, a patient may have more than one attending physician concurrently rendering medical treatment during a single period of time. An attending physician also may be a teaching physician.</p><p class="depth0">Augmentative communication device (ACD).

A service member is a deserter, or in a desertion status, when the Uniformed Service concerned has made an administrative determination to that effect, or the member's period of unauthorized absence has resulted in a court-martial conviction of desertion. Administrative declarations of desertion normally are made when a member has been an unauthorized absentee for over 30 days, but particular circumstances may result in an earlier declaration. Entitlement to CHAMPUS benefits ceases as of 12:01 a.m. on the day following the day the desertion status is declared. Benefits are not to be authorized for treatment received during a period of unauthorized absence that results in a court-martial conviction for desertion. Dependent eligibility for benefits is reestablished when a deserter is returned to military control and continues, even though the member may be in confinement, until any discharge is executed. When a deserter status is later found to have been determined erroneously, the status of deserter is considered never to have existed, and the member's dependents will have been eligible continuously for benefits under CHAMPUS.</p><p class="depth0">Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs). Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are a method of dividing hospital patients into clinically coherent groups based on the consumption of resources.

Also, absences from the home for non-medical purposes, such as an occasional trip to the barber, a walk around the block or a drive, would not necessarily negate the beneficiary's homebound status if the absences are undertaken on an infrequent basis and are of relatively short duration. An exception is made to the above homebound definitional criteria for beneficiaries under the age of 18 and those receiving maternity care. The only homebound criteria for these special beneficiary categories is written certification from a physician attesting to the fact that leaving the home would place the beneficiary at medical risk. In addition to the above, absences, whether regular or infrequent, from the beneficiary's primary residence for the purpose of attending an educational program in a public or private school that is licensed and/or certified by a state, shall not negate the beneficiary's homebound status.</p><p class="depth0">Home health discipline.

Special lifesaving techniques and equipment regularly and immediately are available within the unit, and patients are under continuous observation by a nursing staff specially trained and selected for the care of this type patient. The unit is maintained on a continuing rather than an intermittent or temporary basis. It is not a postoperative recovery room nor a postanesthesia room. In some large or highly specialized hospitals, the ICUs may be further refined for special purposes, such as for respiratory conditions, cardiac surgery, coronary care, burn care, or neurosurgery. For the purposes of CHAMPUS, these specialized units would be considered ICUs if they otherwise conformed to the definition of an ICU.</p><p class="depth0">Intern.
