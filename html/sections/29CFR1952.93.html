                            <p class="depth0">Under the terms of the 1978 Court Order in AFL-CIO v. Marshall  compliance staffing levels (benchmarks) necessary for a ``fully  effective'' enforcement program were required to be established for each  State operating an approved State plan. In September 1984 South  Carolina, in conjunction with OSHA, completed a reassessment of the  levels initially established in 1980 and proposed revised compliance  staffing benchmarks of 17 safety and 12 health compliance officers.  After opportunity for public comment and service on the AFL-CIO, the  Assistant Secretary approved these revised staffing requirements on  January 17, 1986.</p>
