OWCP will accept photocopies, certified copies, and original documents and records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To establish eligibility, the employee or his or her survivor may be required to provide, where appropriate, additional contemporaneous records to the extent they exist or an authorization to release additional contemporaneous records or a statement by the custodian(s) of the record(s) certifying that the requested record(s) no longer exist. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit OWCP's ability to require additional documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a claimant submits a certified statement, by a person with knowledge of the facts, that the medical records containing a diagnosis and date of diagnosis of a covered medical condition no longer exist, then OWCP may consider other evidence to establish a diagnosis and date of diagnosis of a covered medical condition. However, if the certified statement is a self-serving document, OWCP may reject the claim based upon a lack of evidence of a covered medical condition.</p>
