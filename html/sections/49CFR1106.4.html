                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each applicant in a transaction subject to this part shall file  a proposed SIP in accordance with the informational requirements  prescribed at 49 CFR part 244, or other FRA guidelines or requirements  regarding the contents of a SIP, with SEA and FRA no later   than 60 days from the date the application is filed with the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The proposed SIP shall be made part of the environmental record  in the Board proceeding and dealt with in the ongoing environmental  review process under 49 CFR part 1105. The procedures governing the  process shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In accordance with 49 CFR 244.17, FRA will provide its findings  and conclusions on the adequacy of the proposed SIP (i.e., assess  whether the proposed SIP establishes a process that provides a  reasonable assurance of safety in executing the proposed transaction) to  SEA at a date sufficiently in advance of the Board's issuance of its  draft environmental documentation in the case to permit incorporation in  the draft environmental document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The draft environmental documentation shall incorporate the  proposed SIP, any revisions or modifications to it based on further  consultations with FRA, and FRA's written comments regarding the SIP.  The public may review and comment on the draft environmental  documentation within the time limits prescribed by SEA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> SEA will independently review each proposed SIP. In its final  environmental documentation, SEA will address written comments on the  proposed SIP received during the time established for submitting  comments on the draft environmental documentation. The Board then will  consider the full environmental record, including the information  concerning the SIP, in arriving at its decision in the case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Board approves the transaction and adopts the SIP, it  will require compliance with the SIP as a condition to its approval.  Each applicant involved in the transaction then shall coordinate with  FRA in implementing the approved SIP, including any amendments thereto.  FRA has provided in its rules at 49 CFR 244.17(g) for submitting  information to the Board during implementation of an approved  transaction that will assist the Board in exercising its continuing  jurisdiction over the transaction. FRA also has agreed to advise the  Board when, in its view, the integration of the applicants' operations  has been safely completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a SIP is required in transactions that would not be subject  to environmental review under the Board's environmental rules at 49 CFR  part 1105, the Board will develop appropriate case-specific SIP  procedures based on the facts and circumstances presented.</p>
