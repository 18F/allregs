                            <p class="depth0">A. Acceptable types of validity studies. For the purposes of  satisfying these guidelines, users may rely upon criterion-related  validity studies, content validity studies or construct validity  studies, in accordance with the standards set forth in the technical  standards of these guidelines, section 14 below. New strategies for  showing the validity of selection procedures will be evaluated as they  become accepted by the psychological profession.</p><p class="depth0">B. Criterion-related, content, and construct validity. Evidence of  the validity of a test or other selection procedure by a criterion- related validity study should consist of empirical data demonstrating  that the selection procedure is predictive of or significantly  correlated with important elements of job performance. See section 14B  below. Evidence of the validity of a test or other selection procedure  by a content validity study should consist of data showing that the  content of the selection procedure is representative of important  aspects of performance on the job for which the candidates are to be  evaluated. See 14C below. Evidence of the validity of a test or other  selection procedure through a construct validity study should consist of  data showing that the procedure measures the degree to which candidates  have identifiable characteristics which have been determined to be  important in successful performance in the job for which the candidates  are to be evaluated. See section 14D below.</p><p class="depth0">C. Guidelines are consistent with professional standards. The  provisions of these guidelines relating to validation of selection  procedures are intended to be consistent with generally accepted  professional standards for evaluating standardized tests and other  selection procedures, such as those described in the Standards for  Educational and Psychological Tests prepared by a joint committee of the  American Psychological Association, the American Educational Research  Association, and the National Council on Measurement in Education  (American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, 1974) (hereinafter  ``A.P.A. Standards'') and standard textbooks and journals in the field  of personnel selection.</p><p class="depth0">D. Need for documentation of validity. For any selection procedure  which is part of a selection process which has an adverse impact and  which selection procedure has an adverse impact, each user should  maintain and have available such documentation as is described in  section 15 below.</p><p class="depth0">E. Accuracy and standardization. Validity studies should be carried  out under conditions which assure insofar as possible the adequacy and  accuracy of the research and the report. Selection procedures should be  administered and scored under standardized conditions.</p><p class="depth0">F. Caution against selection on basis of knowledges, skills, or  ability learned in brief orientation period. In general, users should  avoid making employment decisions on the basis of measures of  knowledges, skills, or abilities which are normally learned in a brief  orientation period, and which have an adverse impact.</p><p class="depth0">G. Method of use of selection procedures. The evidence of both the  validity and utility of a selection procedure should support the method  the user chooses for operational use of the procedure, if that method of  use has a greater adverse impact than another method of use. Evidence  which may be sufficient to support the use of a selection procedure on a  pass/fail (screening) basis may be insufficient to support the use of  the same procedure on a ranking basis under these guidelines. Thus, if a  user decides to use a selection procedure on a ranking basis, and that  method of use has a greater adverse impact than use on an appropriate  pass/fail basis (see section 5H below), the user should have sufficient  evidence of validity and utility to support the use on a ranking basis.  See sections 3B, 14B (5) and (6), and 14C (8) and (9).</p><p class="depth0">H. Cutoff scores. Where cutoff scores are used, they should normally  be set so as to be reasonable and consistent with normal expectations of  acceptable proficiency within the work force. Where applicants are  ranked on the basis of properly validated selection procedures and those  applicants scoring below a higher cutoff score than appropriate in light  of such expectations have little or no chance of being selected for  employment, the higher cutoff score may be appropriate, but the degree  of adverse impact should be considered.</p><p class="depth0">I. Use of selection procedures for higher level jobs. If job  progression structures are so established that employees will probably,  within a reasonable period of time and in a majority of cases, progress  to a higher level, it may be considered that the applicants are being  evaluated for a job or jobs at the   higher level. However, where job progression is not so nearly automatic,  or the time span is such that higher level jobs or employees' potential  may be expected to change in significant ways, it should be considered  that applicants are being evaluated for a job at or near the entry  level. A ``reasonable period of time'' will vary for different jobs and  employment situations but will seldom be more than 5 years. Use of  selection procedures to evaluate applicants for a higher level job would  not be appropriate:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> If the majority of those remaining employed do not progress to  the higher level job;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> If there is a reason to doubt that the higher level job will  continue to require essentially similar skills during the progression  period; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> If the selection procedures measure knowledges, skills, or  abilities required for advancement which would be expected to develop  principally from the training or experience on the job.</p><p class="depth2">J. Interim use of selection procedures. Users may continue the use  of a selection procedure which is not at the moment fully supported by  the required evidence of validity, provided: (1) The user has available  substantial evidence of validity, and (2) the user has in progress, when  technically feasible, a study which is designed to produce the  additional evidence required by these guidelines within a reasonable  time. If such a study is not technically feasible, see section 6B. If  the study does not demonstrate validity, this provision of these  guidelines for interim use shall not constitute a defense in any action,  nor shall it relieve the user of any obligations arising under Federal  law.</p><p class="depth2">K. Review of validity studies for currency. Whenever validity has  been shown in accord with these guidelines for the use of a particular  selection procedure for a job or group of jobs, additional studies need  not be performed until such time as the validity study is subject to  review as provided in section 3B above. There are no absolutes in the  area of determining the currency of a validity study. All circumstances  concerning the study, including the validation strategy used, and  changes in the relevant labor market and the job should be considered in  the determination of when a validity study is outdated.</p>
