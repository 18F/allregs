as a surface decompression chamber, closed bell, or deep diving system especially equipped to recompress, decompress, and treat divers.</p><p class="depth0">Decompression sickness means a condition caused by the formation of gas or gas bubbles in the blood or body tissue as a result of pressure reduction.</p><p class="depth0">Decompression table means a profile or set of profiles of ascent rates and breathing mixtures designed to reduce the pressure on a diver safely to atmospheric pressure after the diver has been exposed to a specific depth and bottom time.</p><p class="depth0">Depth means the maximum pressure expressed in feet of seawater attained by a diver and is used to express the depth of a dive.</p><p class="depth0">Dive location means that portion of a vessel or facility from which a diving operation is conducted.</p><p class="depth0">Dive team means the divers and diver support personnel involved in a diving operation, including the diving supervisor.</p><p class="depth0">Diver means a person working beneath the surface, exposed to hyperbaric conditions, and using underwater breathing apparatus.</p><p class="depth0">Diver-carried reserve breathing gas means a supply of air or mixed-gas, as appropriate, carried by the diver in addition to the primary or secondary breathing gas supplied to the diver.</p><p class="depth0">Diving installation means all of the equipment used in support of a commercial diving operation.</p><p class="depth0">Diving mode means a type of diving requiring SCUBA, surface-supplied air, or surface-supplied mixed-gas equipment, with related procedures and techniques.</p><p class="depth0">Diving stage means a suspended platform constructed to carry one or more divers and used for putting divers into the water and bringing them to the surface when in-water decompression or a heavy-weight diving outfit is used.</p><p class="depth0">Diving supervisor means the person having complete responsibility for the safety of a commercial diving operation including the responsibility for the safety and health of all diving personnel in accordance with this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Facility means a deepwater port, or an artificial island, installation, or other device on the Outer Continental Shelf subject to Coast Guard jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0">Fsw means feet of seawater (or equivalent static pressure head).</p><p class="depth0">Gas embolism means a condition caused by expanding gases, which have been taken into and retained in the lungs while breathing under pressure, being forced into the bloodstream or other tissues during ascent or decompression.</p><p class="depth0">Heavy-weight diving outfit means diver-worn surface-supplied deep-sea dress.</p><p class="depth0">Hyperbaric conditions means pressure conditions in excess of surface atmospheric pressure.</p><p class="depth0">Injurious corrosion means an advanced state of corrosion which may impair the structural integrity or safe operation of the equipment.</p><p class="depth0">Liveboating means the support of a surfaced-supplied diver from a vessel underway.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum working pressure means the maximum pressure to which a pressure containment device can be exposed under operating conditions (usually the pressure setting of the pressure relief device).</p><p class="depth0">No-decompression limits means the air depth and bottom time limits of appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure vessel means a container capable of withstanding an internal maximum working pressure over 15 psig.</p><p class="depth0">Psi(g) means pounds per square inch (gage).</p><p class="depth0">PVHO means pressure vessel for human occupancy but does not include pressure vessels for human occupancy that may be subjected to external pressures in excess of 15 psig but can only be subjected to maximum internal pressures of 15 psig or less (i.e., submersibles, or one atmosphere observation bells).</p><p class="depth0">Saturation diving means saturating a diver's tissues with the inert gas in the breathing mixture to allow an extension of bottom time without additional decompression.</p><p class="depth0">SCUBA diving means a diving mode in which the diver is supplied with a compressed breathing mixture from diver carried equipment.</p><p class="depth0">Standby diver means a diver at the dive location available to assist a diver in the water.</p><p class="depth0">Surface-supplied air diving means a diving mode in which the diver is supplied from the dive location or bell with compressed breathing air including oxygen or oxygen enriched air if supplied for treatment.</p><p class="depth0">Surface-supplied mixed-gas diving means a diving mode in which the diver is supplied from the dive location or bell with a compressed breathing mixture other than air.</p><p class="depth0">Timekeeping device means a device for measuring the time of a dive in minutes.</p><p class="depth0">Treatment table means a depth, time, and breathing gas profile designed to treat a diver for decompression sickness.</p><p class="depth0">Umbilical means the hose bundle between a dive location and a diver or bell, or between a diver and a bell, that supplies the diver or bell with a life-line, breathing gas, communications, power, and heat as appropriate to the diving mode or conditions.</p><p class="depth0">Vessel means any waterborne craft including mobile offshore drilling units required to have a Certificate of Inspection issued by the Coast Guard or any waterborne
