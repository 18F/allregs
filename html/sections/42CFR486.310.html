(1) A designated OPO considering a change in control (see Sec. 413.17(b)(3)) or ownership or in its service area must notify CMS before putting it into effect. This notification is required to ensure that the OPO, if changed, will continue to satisfy Medicare and Medicaid requirements.

(1) If CMS finds that the OPO has changed to such an extent that it no longer satisfies the requirements for OPO designation, CMS may de-certify the OPO and declare the OPO's service area to be an open area. An OPO may appeal such a de-certification as set forth in Sec. 486.314.

The changed OPO must continue to meet the requirements for certification at Sec. 486.303 throughout the remaining period.</p><p class="depth3">Re-Certification and De-Certification</p>
