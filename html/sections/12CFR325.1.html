                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of this subpart A apply to those circumstances for  which the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or this chapter requires an  evaluation of the adequacy of an insured depository institution's  capital structure. The FDIC is required to evaluate capital before  approving various applications by insured depository institutions. The  FDIC also must evaluate capital, as an essential component, in  determining the safety and soundness of state nonmember banks it insures  and supervises and in determining whether depository institutions are in  an unsafe or unsound condition. This subpart A establishes the criteria  and standards the FDIC will use in calculating the minimum leverage  capital requirement and in determining capital adequacy. In addition,  appendix A to this subpart sets forth the FDIC's risk-based capital  policy statement and appendix B to this subpart includes a statement of  policy on capital adequacy that provides interpretational guidance as to  how this subpart will be administered and enforced. In accordance with  subpart B of part 325, the FDIC also must evaluate an institution's  capital for purposes of determining whether the institution is subject  to the prompt corrective action provisions set forth in section 38 of  the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o).
