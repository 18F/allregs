                                Sec. 9185.3  Requirements for resurveys; without cost to applicant.

Sec. 9185.3-1  Eligibility.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Determined by ownership of land. As a general rule, and in the absence of any particular governmental purpose to be subserved, no township is eligible for resurvey unless title to at least 50 percent of the area of the lands embraced therein remains in the United States. For the purpose of determining the eligibility of a township under this rule, lands covered by approved selections, school sections, and entries upon which final certificates or patents have been issued are to be considered as alienated lands. Townships within the primary limits of railroad land grants are generally ineligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determined by physical character of remaining public land. In general no resurvey will be undertaken unless the preliminary examination of the township develops evidence of existing settlement and agricultural possibilities

sufficient to support the presumption that the unappropriated lands therein are such as to attract bona fide entrymen, thus eliminating townships which, although theoretically eligible, are of such a physical character that the resurvey thereof would serve no useful purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Small areas. In the application of the terms of the Act of March 3, 1909 (35 Stat. 845), as amended, is not intended that there shall be undertaken any work involving the mere reestablishment of lost or obliterated or misplaced corners in a limited area of a township, such work being within the province of the local surveyors, and the authority of the public survey office will be limited to the giving of advice in accordance with the circular for the restoration of lost or obliterated corners. Employees of the Bureau of Land Management are prohibited from participating in the resurvey of a township, the reestablishment of lost corners, or in the subdivision of sections for private parties, even if the expense is borne by the county or municipal authorities or by individuals.


Sec. 9185.3-2  Showing required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Necessity. The applicants for the resurvey of any township are required to present satisfactory prima facie evidence of the necessity for such action, based either upon general obliteration of evidences of the original survey or upon conditions so grossly defective as to preclude the possibility of a reasonably certain identification of the subdivisions of the subsisting survey or a satisfactory local restoration thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Condition of original survey. Applications for the resurvey of each township must be supported by evidence in the form of a statement, preferably from the county or other competent surveyor, showing in detail that the evidences of the original survey have been obliterated to such an extent as to make it impracticable to apply the suggestions of the circular issued by the Bureau of Land Management for the necessary restoration of the lines and corners in the proper identification of the legal subdivisions occupied by the present or prospective entrymen or that the obliteration of the original monuments has become so advanced that the land boundaries can be identified only through extensive retracements by experienced engineers of the Bureau of Land Management.


Sec. 9185.3-3  Majority of land owners.</p><p class="depth0">A majority of the settlers in each township are required to join in the application, and, in addition, there must appear the endorsements of the entrymen and owners, including the State, whose holdings represent the major part of the area entered or patented, with a description opposite each name of the lands actually occupied, entered, or owned, and a statement as to whether the applicant is a settler, entryman, or owner thereof. Where an entryman or owner, including the State, has failed for any reason whatsoever to join in the application, evidence of service of notice upon him for at least 30 days in advance of the filing of the application is required in order that he may be afforded ample opportunity to make timely protest against the granting of such resurvey if in his opinion such action is undesirable.</p>
