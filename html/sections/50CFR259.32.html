                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary may from time-to-time establish certain fisheries in which CCF benefits will be restricted. The regulatory mechanism for so doing is part 251 of this chapter. Each fishery so restricted is termed a ``conditional fishery''. Subpart A of part 251 of this chapter establishes the procedure to be used by the Secretary in proposing and adopting a fishery as a conditional fishery. Subpart B of part 251 of this chapter enumerates each fishery actually adopted as a conditional fishery (part 251 of this chapter should be referred to for details). The purpose of this Sec. 259.32 is to establish the effect of conditional fishery adoption upon Interim CCF Agreements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a written request for an otherwise permissible action under an Interim CCF Agreement is submitted prior to the date upon which conditional fishery adoption occurs, then the Secretary will act, in an otherwise normal manner, upon so much of the action then applied for as is then permissible without regard to the subsequent adoption of a conditional fishery (even, if that adoption occurs before the Secretary gives his consent or issues an Interim CCF Agreement or amendment thereto, all as the case may be). Nevertheless, the conditions as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a written request for an otherwise permissible action under an Interim CCF Agreement, or an application for an Interim CCF Agreement, is submitted after the date upon which conditional fishery adoption occurs, then the Secretary will act, in an otherwise normal manner, upon so much of the action then applied for as is then permissible without regard to the previous adoption of a conditional fishery provided, however, that this paragraph shall apply only to construction or reconstruction for which a binding contract has been reduced to writing prior to the date upon which conditional fishery adoption occurred. Nevertheless, the conditions as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conditional fishery adoption shall have no effect whatsoever upon a Schedule B objective whose qualification for withdrawal (which may be in an amount equal to the total cost over time of a Schedule B objective, i.e., a series of withdrawals) has been, prior to the date of conditional fishery adoption, either consented to by the Secretary or requested in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. This extends to past, present, and future withdrawals in an amount representing up to 100 percent of the cost of a Schedule B objective. Commencement of any project in these categories shall, however, be started not later than 6 months from the date of conditional fishery adoption and shall be completed within 24 months from the date of conditional fishery adoption, unless for good and sufficient cause shown the Secretary, at his discretion, consents to a longer period for either project commencement or completion. Consent to the qualification of withdrawal for any project in these categories not commenced or completed within the periods allowed shall be revoked at the end of the periods allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conditional fishery adoption shall have no effect whatsoever upon Schedule B objectives which will not result in significantly increasing harvesting capacity in a fishery adopted as a conditional fishery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Construction of a new vessel (vessel ``Y'') for operation in an adopted conditional fishery shall be deemed to significantly increase harvesting capacity in that fishery unless the party causing the ``Y'' vessel to be constructed causes (within 1 year after the delivery of vessel ``Y'') to be permanently removed from all fishing, or

placed permanently in a fishery not then adopted as a conditional fishery, under such conditions as the Secretary may deem necessary or desirable, a vessel (vessel ``Z'') which has during the previous 18 months operated substantially in the same fishery as the ``Y'' vessel and which has a fishing capacity substantially equivalent to the ``Y'' vessel. Failure to remove a vessel could subject all withdrawals to be treated as nonqualified and may be cause for termination of the CCF. What constitutes substantially equivalent fishing capacity shall be a matter for the Secretary's discretion. Ordinarily, in exercising his discretion about what does or does not constitute substantially equivalent fishing capacity, the Secretary will take into consideration (i) the average size of vessels constructed for the adopted conditional fishery in question at the time vessel ``Z'' was constructed (or, if constructed for a different fishery, the average size of vessels in the adopted conditional fishery at the time vessel ``Z'' entered it), (ii) the average size of vessels constructed for the adopted conditional fishery at the time vessel ``Y'' was or will be constructed, and (iii) such other factors as the Secretary may deem material and equitable, including the length of time the party had owned or leased vessel ``Z'' and the length of time the vessel has operated in the conditional fishery. The Secretary will consider these factors, and exercise his discretion, in such a way as to encourage use of this program by established fishermen who have owned or leased for substantial periods vessels which need to be replaced, even though a ``Z'' vessel may have been constructed at a time which dictated a lesser fishing capacity than dictated for a ``Y'' vessel at the time of its construction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acquisition and/or reconstruction of a used vessel for operation in an adopted conditional fishery shall be deemed to significantly increase harvesting capacity in that fishery unless the vessel to be acquired and/or reconstructed had during the previous 3 years operated substantially in the same fishery as the adopted conditional fishery in which it will operate after acquisition and/or reconstruction. If less than 3 years, then acquisition and/or reconstruction of a used vessel for operation in an adopted conditional fishery shall be deemed to significantly increase harvesting capacity in that fishery unless there occurs vessel removal or permanent placement elsewhere under the same conditions specified for construction in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Construction of a new vessel or the acquisition and/or reconstruction of a used vessel for operation in an adopted conditional fishery shall not be deemed to significantly increase the harvesting capacity where the vessel constructed, acquired and/or reconstructed replaces another vessel which was lost or destroyed and which had, immediately prior to the loss or destruction, operated in the same fishery as the adopted conditional fishery, provided, however, that the fishing capacity of the replacement vessel has a fishing capacity substantially equivalent to the vessel lost or destroyed and that the construction, acquisition and/or reconstruction is completed within 2 years after the close of the taxable year in which the loss or destruction occurred. The Secretary may, at his discretion, and for good and sufficient cause shown, extend the replacement period, provided that the request for extension of time to replace is timely filed with the Secretary</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Conditional fishery adoption shall have the following effect on all Schedule B objectives (whether for acquisition, construction, or reconstruction) which the Secretary deems to significantly increase harvesting capacity in that fishery, excluding those circumstances specifically exempted by paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section (which shall be governed by the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary may nevertheless consent to the qualification of withdrawal, but only up to an amount not exceeding the total of eligible ceilings actually deposited during tax years other than the taxable year in which conditional fishery adoption occurs plus a pro-rata portion of eligible ceilings generated in the tax year in which conditional fishery adoption occurs. Pro-ration shall be according to the number of months or any part thereof

in a party's tax year which elapse before the adoption of the conditional fishery occurs. For example, if a party's tax year runs from January 1, 1974, to December 31, 1974, and conditional fishery adoption occurs on August 15, 1974, (i.e., during the 8th month of the party's tax year), then the pro-rata portion for that year is eight-twelfths of the total eligible ceilings generated during that year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Qualified withdrawals in excess of the amount specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall not, during the continuance of the adopted conditional fishery, be consented to. Parties at this point shall have the following option:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Make, with the Secretary's consent, a nonqualified withdrawal of the excess and discontinue the future deposit of eligible ceilings (which may effect termination of the Interim CCF Agreement).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reserve the excess, as well as the future deposit of eligible ceilings, for a Schedule B objective not then involving an adopted conditional fishery. If amendment of an Interim CCF Agreement is necessary in order to include a Schedule B objective not then involving an adopted conditional fishery, the party may, with the Secretary's consent, make the necessary amendment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reserve the excess, as well as the future deposit of eligible ceilings, for a Schedule B objective involving a then adopted conditional fishery in anticipation that the then adopted conditional fishery will eventually be disadopted, in which case all deposits of eligible ceilings will once again be eligible for the Secretary's consent as qualified withdrawals. If the adoption of a conditional fishery continues for a substantial length of time and there is no forseeable prospect of disadoption, then the Secretary, in his discretion, may require paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section to be effected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Secretary shall neither enter into a new Interim CCF Agreement, nor permit amendment of an existing one, which involves a Schedule B objective in a then adopted conditional fishery unless paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this Sec. 259.32 applies or unless the Schedule B objective is expressly conditioned upon acquisition construction, or reconstruction of the type permitted under paragraph (e) of this Sec. 259.32. Such an express condition would not survive beyond the time at which conditional fishery status is removed.</p>
