If merchandise without the required marking is to be delivered from the post office where it has been given Customs examination, the Customs officer shall require compliance with the marking law and regulations. If it is to be delivered from another post office, the Customs officer shall place in the envelope containing the mail entry a copy of Customs Form 3475, containing instructions to the postmaster concerning the marking to be required before delivery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other marking requirements. Certain types of merchandise are subject to special marking requirements, such as those contained in the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act, the Wool Products Labeling Act, and the Trademark Act. Since there is no provision for post office supervision of these types of marking, the port director shall require compliance with the law and regulations (see parts 11 and 133 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to mark. If the addressee fails to comply with the marking requirements, the mail article will be treated as undeliverable in accordance with Sec. 145.5.
