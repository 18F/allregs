                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> There are five general Acts of Congress which authorize the  allowance, under certain conditions, of an extension of time for the  submission of final proof by a desert-land claimant. Said Acts are the  following: June 27, 1906 (Sec. 5, 34 Stat. 520; 43 U.S.C. 448); March  28, 1908 (Sec. 3, 35 Stat. 52; 43 U.S.C. 333); April 30, 1912 (37 Stat.  106; 43 U.S.C. 334); March 4, 1915 (Sec. 5, 38 Stat. 1161; 43 U.S.C.  335); and February 25, 1925 (43 Stat. 982; 43 U.S.C. 336). The Act of  June 27, 1906, is applicable only to entries embraced within the  exterior limits of some withdrawal or irrigation project under the  Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. 388).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the Acts cited in this section, extensions of  time for making desert-land proofs were authorized by the Acts of June  16, 1933 (48 Stat. 274; 43 U.S.C. 256a), July 26, 1935 (49 Stat. 504; 43  U.S.C. 256a), and June 16, 1937 (50 Stat. 303; 43 U.S.C. 256a). Such  Acts affect only proofs becoming due on or before December 31, 1936. For  that reason, the regulations which were issued thereunder have not been  included in this chapter.</p>
