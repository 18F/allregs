This part is issued by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) pursuant to sections 1313(a), 1313(b)(1), and 1313(b)(5) of the Federal Housing Enterprise Financial Safety and Soundness Act (Act) (12 U.S.C. 4513(a), 4513(b)(1), and 4513(b)(5)). These provisions of the Act authorize OFHEO to take any action deemed appropriate by the Director of OFHEO to ensure that the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (the Enterprises) are operated in a safe and sound manner, including by

adopting supervisory policies and standards by regulation, guidance, or other process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preservation of existing authority. No action by OFHEO undertaken with reference to a policy guidance or this regulation will in any way limit the authority of the Director otherwise to address unsafe or unsound conditions or practices, or other violations of law, rule or regulation. Action with reference to a policy guidance or this regulation may be taken separate from, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other supervisory response, enforcement action, or agency-imposed requirements deemed appropriate by OFHEO. Nothing in this regulation or any guidance issued by OFHEO limits the authority of the Director pursuant to section 1313 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 4513) or any other provision of law, rule or regulation applicable to the Enterprises.</p>
