                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General licenses. General licenses have been issued authorizing under appropriate terms and conditions certain types of transactions which are subject to the prohibitions contained in this chapter. General licenses are set forth in subpart E of each part contained in

this chapter, and they also may be available through the following page on OFAC's Web site: http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/programs/Pages/Programs.aspx. General licenses may also be issued authorizing under appropriate terms and conditions certain types of transactions which are subject to prohibitions contained in economic sanctions programs the implementation and administration of which have been delegated to the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control but which are not yet codified in this chapter. It is the policy of the Office of Foreign Assets Control not to grant applications for specific licenses authorizing transactions to which the provisions of an outstanding general license are applicable. Persons availing themselves of certain general licenses may be required to file reports and statements in accordance with the instructions specified in those licenses. Failure to file such reports or statements will nullify the authority of the general license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specific licenses--(1) General course of procedure.

Original signed applications for specific licenses to engage in any transactions prohibited by or pursuant to this chapter or sanctions programs that have been delegated to the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control for implementation and administration must be filed by mail or courier.

Applications for the unblocking of funds transfers must be submitted using TD-F 90-22.54, ``Application for the Release of Blocked Funds,'' accompanied by two complete copies of the entire submission. The form, which requires information regarding the date of the blocking, the financial institutions involved in the transfer, and the beneficiary and amount of the transfer, may be obtained from the OFAC Internet Home Page: http://www.treas.gov/ofac, the OFAC fax-on-demand service: 202/622-0077, or the Compliance Programs Division, Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20220.
