Such licensee may also be subject to  enforcement action, including forfeitures. In addition, an EA or CMA  licensee that provides signal coverage and offers service at a level  that is below this end-of-term benchmark may be subject to license  termination.

Such licensee may also be subject to enforcement action, including  forfeitures. In the event that a licensee's authority to operate in a  license area terminates automatically without Commission action, such  areas will become available for reassignment pursuant to the procedures  in paragraph (j) of this section.

During this 30-day  period, licensees that had their authority to operate terminate  automatically for unserved areas may not file applications to provide  service to these areas. Applications filed by third parties that propose  areas overlapping with other applications will be deemed mutually  exclusive, and will be resolved through an auction. The Wireless  Telecommunications Bureau, by public notice, may specify a limited  period before the filing of short-form applications (FCC Form 175)  during which applicants may enter into a settlement to resolve their  mutual exclusivity, subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.935 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Following this 30-day period, the original licensee and third  parties can file license applications for remaining unserved areas where  licenses have not been issued or for which there are no pending  applications. If the original licensee or a third party files an  application, that application will be placed on public notice for 30  days. If no mutually exclusive application is filed, the application  will be granted, provided that a grant is found to be in the public  interest. If a mutually exclusive application is filed, it will be  resolved through an auction. The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, by  public notice, may specify a limited period before the filing of short- form applications (FCC Form 175) during which applicants may enter into  a settlement to   resolve their mutual exclusivity, subject to the provisions of Sec.  1.935 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The licensee will have one year from the date the new license is  issued to complete its construction and provide signal coverage and  offer service over 100 percent of the geographic area of the new license  area.

The EBS  licensee must also be otherwise in compliance with this Chapter  (including the programming requirements in Sec. 27.1203 of this  subpart).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the GSA of a licensee is less than 1924 square miles in size,  and there is an overlapping co-channel station licensed or leased by the  licensee or its affiliate, substantial service may be demonstrated by  meeting the requirements of paragraph (o)(1) or (o)(2) of this section  with respect to the combined GSAs of both stations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the GSA of a BTA authorization holder, is less than one-half  of the area within the BTA for every BRS channel, substantial service  may be demonstrated for the licenses in question by meeting the  requirements of paragraph (o)(1) or (o)(2) of this section with respect  to the combined GSAs of the BTA authorization holder, together with any  incumbent authorizations licensed or leased by the licensee or its  affiliates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> This section enumerates performance requirements for licensees  holding authorizations for Block A in the 2305-2310 MHz and 2350-2355  MHz bands, Block B in the 2310-2315 MHz and 2355-2360 MHz bands, Block C  in the 2315-2320 MHz band, and Block D in the 2345-2350 MHz band.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For mobile and point-to-multipoint systems in Blocks A and B,  and point-to-multipoint systems in Blocks C and D, a licensee must  provide reliable signal coverage and offer service to at least 40  percent of the license area's population by March 13, 2017, and to at  least 75 percent of the license area's population by September 13, 2019.  If, when filing the construction notification required under Sec.  1.946(d) of this chapter, a WCS licensee demonstrates that 25 percent or  more of the license area's population for Block A, B or D is within a  coordination zone as defined by Sec. 27.73(a) of the rules, the  foregoing population benchmarks are reduced to 25 and 50 percent,  respectively. The percentage of a license area's population within a  coordination zone equals the sum of the Census Block Centroid  Populations within the area, divided by the license area's total  population.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For point-to-point fixed systems, except those deployed in the  Gulf of Mexico license area, a licensee must construct and operate a  minimum of 15 point-to-point links per million persons (one link per  67,000 persons) in a license area by March 13, 2017, and 30 point-to- point links per million persons (one link per 33,500 persons) in a  licensed area by September 13, 2019.   The exact link requirement is calculated by dividing a license area's  total population by 67,000 and 33,500 for the respective milestones, and  then rounding upwards to the next whole number. For a link to be counted  towards these benchmarks, both of its endpoints must be located in the  license area. If only one endpoint of a link is located in a license  area, it can be counted as a one- half link towards the benchmarks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For point-to-point fixed systems deployed on any spectrum block  in the Gulf of Mexico license area, a licensee must construct and  operate a minimum of 15 point-to-point links by March 13, 2017, and a  minimum of 15 point-to-point links by September 13, 2019.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Under paragraph (p)(2) and (p)(3) of this section, each fixed  link must provide a minimum bit rate, in bits per second, equal to or  greater than the bandwidth specified by the emission designator in Hertz  (e.g., equipment transmitting at a 5 Mb/s rate must not require a  bandwidth of greater than 5 MHz).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If an initial authorization for a license area is granted after  March 13, 2013, then the applicable benchmarks in paragraphs (p)(1), (2)  and (3) of this section must be met within 48 and 78 months,  respectively, of the initial authorization grant date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Licensees must use the most recently available U.S. Census Data  at the time of measurement to meet these performance requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Licensees must certify compliance with the applicable  performance requirements by filing a construction notification with the  Commission, within 15 days of the expiration of the relevant performance  milestone, pursuant to Sec. 1.946(d) of this chapter.

Electronic  coverage maps must accurately depict the boundaries of each license area  (Regional Economic Area Grouping, REAG, or Major Economic Area, MEA) in  the licensee's service territory. Further, REAG maps must depict MEA  boundaries and MEA maps must depict Economic Area boundaries. If a  licensee does not provide reliable signal coverage to an entire license  area, its map must accurately depict the boundaries of the area or areas  within each license area not being served. Each licensee also must file  supporting documentation certifying the type of service it is providing  for each REAG or MEA within its service territory and the type of  technology used to provide such service. Supporting documentation must  include the assumptions used to create the coverage maps, including the  propagation model and the signal strength necessary to provide reliable  service with the licensee's technology.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If a licensee fails to meet any applicable performance  requirement, its authorization will terminate automatically without  further Commission action as of the applicable performance milestone and  the licensee will be ineligible to regain it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> The following provisions apply to any licensee holding an AWS  authorization in the 2000-2020 MHz and 2180-2200 MHz bands (an ``AWS-4  licensee''):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An AWS-4 licensee shall provide terrestrial signal coverage and  offer terrestrial service within four (4) years from the date of the  license to at least forty (40) percent of the total population in the  aggregate service areas that it has licensed in the 2000-2020 MHz and  2180-2200 MHz bands (``AWS-4 Interim Buildout Requirement'').
