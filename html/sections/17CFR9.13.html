                            <p class="depth0">Whenever an exchange suspends, expels or otherwise disciplines, or denies any person access to the exchange, it must make public its findings by disclosing at least the information contained in the notice required by Sec. 9.11(b). An exchange must make such findings public as soon as the disciplinary action or access denial action becomes effective in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 9.12 by posting a notice in a conspicuous place on its premises to which its members and the public regularly have access for a period of five consecutive business days. Thereafter, the exchange must maintain and make available for public inspection a record of the information contained in the disciplinary or access denial notice.
