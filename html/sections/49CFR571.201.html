The other door frame reference point (Point ODR) is the point located at the middle of the line between Point 23 and Point 24 in Plane 37, measured along the vehicle interior surface. Target OD1 is located at Point ODR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a seat belt anchorage is located on the door frame, Target OD1 is any point on the anchorage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Target OD2. Locate the horizontal plane (Plane 38) intersecting Point ODR. Locate a horizontal plane (Plane 39) passing through the lowest point of the daylight opening forward of the door frame. Locate a horizontal plane (Plane 40) half-way between Plane 38 and Plane 39. Target OD2 is the point located on the interior surface of the door frame at the intersection of Plane 40 and the center line of the width of the door frames, as viewed laterally, with the doors in the closed position.</p><p class="depth0">S10.16 Seat belt mounting structure targets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Target SB1. Target SB1 is located at any point on the seat belt anchorage mounted on the seat belt mounting structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Target SB2. Locate a horizontal plane (Plane 41), containing either CG-F2 or CG-R, as appropriate, for any outboard designated seating position whose seating reference point, SgRP, is forward of and closest to, the vertical center line of the width of the seat belt mounting structure as viewed laterally. Target SB2 is located on the seat belt mounting structure and in Plane 41 at the location closest to either CG-F2 or CG-R, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Target SB3. Locate a horizontal plane (Plane 42), containing CG-R for any outboard designated seating position rearward of the forwardmost designated seating position or positions whose seating reference point, SgRP, is rearward of and closest to, the vertical center line of the width of the seat belt mounting structure, as viewed laterally. Locate a horizontal plane (Plane 43) 200 mm below Plane 42. Target SB3 is located on the seat belt mounting structure and in Plane 43 at the location closest to CG-R, as appropriate.
