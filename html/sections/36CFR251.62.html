The authorization must be signed by the applicant and returned to the authorized officer within 60 days of its receipt by the applicant, unless extended by the authorized officer. Refusal of an applicant to sign and accept a special use authorization within the time allowed, and before its final approval and signature by an authorized officer, shall terminate an application and constitute denial of the requested use and occupancy.
