                                Sec. 102-75.255  What are disposal agencies' specific responsibilities
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The disposal agency must determine that there is no further Federal  need or requirement for the excess real property and the property is  surplus to the needs of the Federal Government. After reaching this  determination, the disposal agency must expeditiously make the surplus  property available for acquisition by State and local governmental units  and non-profit institutions (see Sec. 102-75.350) or for sale by public  advertising, negotiation, or other disposal action. The disposal agency  must consider the availability of real property for public purposes on a  case-by-case basis, based on highest and best use and estimated fair  market value. Where hazardous substance activity is identified, see  Sec. Sec. 102-75.340 and 102-75.345 for required information that the  disposal agency must incorporate into the offer to purchase and  conveyance document.</p>
