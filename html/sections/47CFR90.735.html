                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except for nationwide systems authorized in the 220-222 MHz band, station identification is required pursuant to Sec. 90.425 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Trunked systems shall employ an automatic device to transmit the call sign of the base station at 30 minute intervals. The identification shall be made on the lowest frequency in the base station trunked group assigned to the licensee. If this frequency is in use at the time identification is required, the identification may be made at the termination of the communication in progress on this frequency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Station identification may be by voice or International Morse Code. If the call sign is transmitted in International Morse Code, it must be at a rate of between 15 to 20 words per minute, and by means of tone modulation of the transmitter, with the tone

frequency being between 800 and 1000 hertz.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Digital transmissions may also be identified by digital transmission of the station call sign. A licensee that identifies its station in this manner must provide the Commission, upon its request, information (such as digital codes and algorithms) sufficient to decipher the data transmission to ascertain the call sign transmitted.
