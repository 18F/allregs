                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement for agreements. Payments must be made only to  institutions operating under an agreement with the State agency for the  meal types specified in the agreement served at approved child care  centers, at-risk afterschool care centers, adult day care centers,  emergency shelters, and outside-school-hours care centers. A State  agency may develop a policy under which centers are reimbursed for meals  served in accordance with provisions of the Program in the calendar  month preceding the calendar month in which the agreement is executed,  or the State agency may develop a policy under which centers receive  reimbursement only for meals served in approved centers on and after the  effective date of the Program agreement. If the State agency's policy  permits centers to earn reimbursement for meals served prior to the  execution of a Program agreement, program reimbursement must not be  received by the center until the agreement is executed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Institutions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Edit checks of sponsored centers. Prior to  submitting its consolidated monthly claim to the State agency, each  sponsoring organization must conduct reasonable edit checks on the  sponsored centers' meal claims, which at a minimum, must include those  edit checks specified at Sec. 226.10(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Child and adult care institutions. Each child care institution  and each adult day care institution must report each month to the State  agency the total number of Program meals, by type (breakfasts, lunches,  suppers, and snacks), served to children or adult participants,  respectively, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For-profit center exception. For-profit child care centers,  including for-profit at-risk afterschool care centers and outside- school-hours care centers, must provide the reports required in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section only for calendar months during which  at least 25 percent of the children in care (enrolled or licensed  capacity, whichever is less) were eligible for free or reduced-price  meals or were title XX beneficiaries. However, children who only receive  at-risk afterschool snacks and/or at-risk afterschool meals must not be  considered in determining this eligibility. For-profit adult day care  centers must provide the reports required in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section only for calendar months during which at least 25 percent of  enrolled adult participants were beneficiaries of title XIX, title XX,  or a combination of titles XIX and XX.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reimbursement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Child and adult care institutions. Each State  agency must base reimbursement to each approved child care center and  adult day care center on actual time of service meal counts of meals, by  type, served to children or adult participants multiplied by the  assigned rates of reimbursement, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)  of this section. In the case   of a sponsoring organization of family day care homes, each State agency  must base reimbursement to each approved family day care home on daily  meal counts recorded by the provider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At-risk afterschool care institutions. Except as provided in  paragraph (c)(4) of this section, State agencies must base reimbursement  to each at-risk afterschool care center on the number of at-risk  afterschool snacks and/or at-risk afterschool meals that are served to  children.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Emergency shelters. Each State agency must base reimbursement to  each emergency shelter on the number of meals served to children  multiplied by the free rates for meals and snacks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For-profit center exception. For-profit child care centers,  including for-profit at-risk and outside-school-hours care centers, must  be reimbursed only for the calendar months during which at least 25  percent of the children in care (enrolled or licensed capacity,  whichever is less) were eligible for free or reduced-price meals or were  title XX beneficiaries. However, children who only receive at-risk  afterschool snacks and/or at-risk afterschool meals must not be  considered in determining this eligibility. For-profit adult day care  centers must be reimbursed only for the calendar months during which at  least 25 percent of enrolled adult participants were beneficiaries of  title XIX, title XX, or a combination of titles XIX and XX.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Computation of reimbursement. Except for at-risk afterschool  care centers and emergency shelters, the State agency must compute  reimbursement by either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Actual counts. Base reimbursement to institutions on actual time  of service counts of meals served, and multiply the number of meals, by  type, served to participants that are eligible to receive free meals,  participants eligible to receive reduced-price meals, and participants  not eligible for free or reduced-price meals by the applicable national  average payment rate; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Claiming percentages. Apply the applicable claiming percentage  or percentages to the total number of meals, by type, served to  participants and multiply the product or products by the assigned rate  of reimbursement for each meal type; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Blended rates. Multiply the assigned blended per meal rate of  reimbursement by the total number of meals, by type, served to  participants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limits on reimbursement. If the State agency elects to reimburse  its institutions according to the lesser of rates or actual costs, total  Program payments to an institution during any fiscal year, including any  cash payments in lieu of commodities, shall not exceed allowable Program  operating and administrative costs, less income to the Program. The  State agency may limit payments for administrative costs to the amount  approved in the annual administrative budget of the institution. The  State agency may prohibit an institution from using payments for  operating costs to pay for administrative expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Institution recordkeeping. Each institution shall maintain  records as prescribed by the State agency's financial management system.
