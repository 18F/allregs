                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. It is RHS's policy to promote compact community development and not to approve sites located in floodplains, on wetlands, or on important farmlands, unless there is no practical alternative. Furthermore, RHS will not finance development on locations that adversely affect properties which are listed or are eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, located within the Coastal Barrier Resource System, or on a barrier island. (Environmental requirements are found in 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G.) In order to be eligible for RHS participation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The site must be located in an eligible area as defined in the program regulations under which the development is being funded or approved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The site must comply with the applicable environmental laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and subpart G of part 1940.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Single Family Housing. In addition to the general requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, sites must provide a desirable, safe, functional, convenient, and attractive living environment for the residents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Multiple Family Housing. Multiple family housing projects shall be located in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (r) of Sec. 1944.215. Locating sites in less than desirable locations of the community because they are in close proximity to undesirable influences such as high activity railroad tracks; adjacent to or behind industrial sites; bordering sites or structures which are not decent, safe, or sanitary; or bordering sites which have potential environmental concerns such as processing plants, etc., is not acceptable. Screening such sites does not make them acceptable. Sites which are not an integral part of a residential community and do not have a reasonable access, either by location or terrain, to essential community facilities such as water, sewerage, schools, shopping, employment opportunities, medical facilities, etc., are not acceptable.</p>
