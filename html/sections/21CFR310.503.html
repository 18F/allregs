                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> On January 8, 1963 (28 FR 183), the Commissioner of Food and  Drugs exempted investigational radioactive new drugs from part 312 of  this chapter provided they were shipped in complete conformity with the  regulations issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This exemption  also applied to investigational radioactive biologics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> It is the opinion of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the  Food and Drug Administration that this exemption should not apply for  certain specific drugs and that these drugs should be appropriately  labeled for uses for which safety and effectiveness can be demonstrated  by new drug applications or through licensing under the Public Health  Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262 et seq.) in the case of biologics. Continued  distribution under the investigational exemption when the drugs are  intended for established uses will not be permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Based on its experience in regulating investigational  radioactive pharmaceuticals, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has  compiled a list of reactor-produced isotopes for which it considers that  applicants may reasonably be expected to submit adequate evidence of  safety and effectiveness for use as recommended in appropriate labeling.  Such use may include, among others, the uses in this tabulation:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Isotope              Chemical form                 Use ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Chromium 51...........
