                                Sec. 184.1445  Malt syrup (malt extract).

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Malt is the product of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) germinated under controlled conditions. Malt syrup and malt extract are interchangeable terms for a viscous concentrate of water extract of germinated barley grain, with or without added safe preservative. Malt syrup is usually a brown, sweet, and viscous liquid containing varying amounts of amylolytic enzymes and plant constituents. Barley is first softened after cleaning by steeping operations and then allowed to germinate under controlled conditions. The germinated grain then undergoes processing, such as drying, grinding, extracting, filtering, and evaporating, to produce malt syrup (malt extract) with 75 to 80 percent solids or dried malt syrup with higher solids content.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ingredient must be of a purity suitable for its intended use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In accordance with Sec. 184.1(b)(1), the ingredient is used in food with no limitation other than current good manufacturing practice. The affirmation of this ingredient as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as a direct human food ingredient is based upon the following current good manufacturing practice conditions of use:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ingredient is used as a flavoring agent and adjuvant as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(12) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ingredient is used in food at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior sanctions for this ingredient different from the uses established in this section do not exist or have been waived.
