                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grounds. At any time subsequent to the time a determination becomes final pursuant to this subpart, the Commission, on its own motion, or in response to a petition filed by any person aggrieved or adversely affected by the determination, may reopen the determination if it appears that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In making the determination, the Commission or the jurisdictional agency relied on any untrue statement of material fact; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There was omitted a statement of material fact necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading, in light of the circumstances under which they were made to the jurisdictional agency or the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of petition. A petition to reopen the determination proceedings must contain the following information, under oath:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and address of the person filing the petition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The interest of the petitioner in the outcome of the determination proceeding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The statement of material fact that is alleged to be untrue or omitted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement explaining why the outcome of the determination proceeding would have been different had the statement or omission not occurred; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Copies of all documents relied on by the petitioner, or references to such documents if they are contained in the public files of the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures after reopening. In the event the Commission reopens a determination pursuant to this section it will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Give notice to the jurisdictional agency and all persons who participated before both that agency and the Commission in the proceedings resulting in the determination in question;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permit the jurisdictional agency and other persons receiving notice pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section to submit whatever documentary evidence such agency or persons deem relevant; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Take such other action or hold or cause to be held such proceedings as it deems necessary or appropriate for a full disclosure of the facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Final order of Commission. Within 150 days after issuance of the notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Commission shall issue a final order. If the Commission finds that the grounds referred to in paragraph (a) of this section exist, it will vacate the determination.</p>
