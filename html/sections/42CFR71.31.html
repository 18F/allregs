Carriers not subject to inspection under this section will be subject to sanitary inspection under Sec.  71.41 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Director may require detention of a carrier until the completion of the measures outlined in this part that are necessary to prevent the introduction or spread of a communicable disease. The Director may issue a controlled free pratique to the carrier stipulating what measures are to be met, but such issuance does not prevent the periodic boarding of a carrier and the inspection of persons and records to verify that the conditions have been met for granting the pratique.</p>
