                            <p class="depth0">The licensee of an AM broadcast station may use its AM carrier to  transmit signals not audible on ordinary consumer receivers, for both  broadcast and non-broadcast purposes subject to the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Such use does not disrupt or degrade the station's own programs  or the programs of other broadcast stations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> AM carrier services that are common carrier in nature are  subject to common carrier regulation. Licensees operating such services  are required to apply to the FCC for the appropriate authorization and  to comply with all policies and rules applicable to the service.  Responsibility for making the initial determinations of whether a  particular activity is common carriage rests with the AM station  licensee. Initial determinations by licensees are subject to FCC  examination and may be reviewed at the FCC's discretion. AM carrier  services that are private carrier in nature must notify the Licensing  Division of the Private Radio Bureau at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania 17325,  by letter, prior to initiating service certifying compliance with 47 CFR  parts 90 and 94.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> AM carrier services are of a secondary nature under the  authority of the AM station authorization, and the authority to provide  such communications services may not be retained or transferred in any  manner separate from the station's authorization. The grant or renewal  of an AM station permit or license is not furthered or promoted by  proposed or past service. The permittee or licensee must establish that  the broadcast operation is in the public interest wholly apart from the  subsidiary communications services provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The station identification, delayed recording, and sponsor  identification announcements required by Sec. Sec.  73.1201, 73.1208,  and 73.1212 are not applicable to leased communications services  transmitted via services that are not of a general broadcast program  nature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The licensee or permittee must retain control over all material  transmitted in a broadcast mode via the station's facilities, with the  right to reject any material that it deems inappropriate or undesirable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Installation of the multiplex transmitting equipment must  conform with the requirements of Sec.  73.1690(e).
