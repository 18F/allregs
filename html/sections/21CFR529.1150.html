                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Specifications. Each milliliter of solution contains 396.1 milligrams (mg) hydrogen peroxide (a 35% w/w solution).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sponsor. See No. 050378 in Sec. 510.600(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conditions of use in finfish--(1) Amount--(i) Freshwater-reared finfish eggs: 500 to 1,000 mg per liter (/L) of culture water for 15 minutes in a continuous flow system once per day on consecutive or alternate days until hatch for all coldwater and coolwater species of freshwater-reared finfish eggs or 750 to 1,000 mg/L for 15 minutes in a continuous flow system once per day on consecutive or alternate days until hatch for all warmwater species of freshwater-reared finfish eggs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amount--(i) Freshwater-reared finfish eggs: 500 to 1,000 mg per liter (/L) of culture water for 15 minutes in a continuous flow system once per day on consecutive or alternate days until hatch for all coldwater and coolwater species of freshwater-reared finfish eggs or 750 to 1,000 mg/L for 15 minutes in a continuous flow system once per day on consecutive or alternate days until hatch for all warmwater species of freshwater-reared finfish eggs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Freshwater-reared finfish eggs: 500 to 1,000 mg per liter (/L) of culture water for 15 minutes in a continuous flow system once per day on consecutive or alternate days until hatch for all coldwater and coolwater species of freshwater-reared finfish eggs or 750 to 1,000 mg/L for 15 minutes in a continuous flow system once per day on consecutive or alternate days until hatch for all warmwater species of freshwater-reared finfish eggs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Freshwater-reared salmonids: 100 mg/L for 30 minutes or 50 to 100 mg/L for 60 minutes once per day on alternate days for three treatments in a continuous flow water supply or as a static bath.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Coolwater species of freshwater-reared finfish fingerlings and adults (except northern pike & paddlefish) and channel catfish fingerlings and adults: 50 to 75 mg/L for 60 minutes once per day on alternate days for three treatments in continuous flow water supply or as a static bath. Coolwater species of freshwater-reared finfish fry (except northern pike, pallid sturgeon & paddlefish) and channel catfish fry: 50 mg/L for 60 minutes once per day on alternate days for three treatments in continuous flow water supply or as a static bath.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indications for use. For control of mortality in freshwater-reared finfish eggs due to saprolegniasis; for control of mortality in freshwater-reared salmonids due to bacterial gill disease associated with Flavobacterium branchiophilum; and for control of mortality in freshwater-reared coolwater finfish and channel catfish due to external columnaris disease associated with Flavobacterium columnare (Flexibacter columnaris).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limitations. Initial bioassay on a small number is recommended before treating the entire group. Eggs: Some strains of rainbow trout eggs are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide treatment at a time during incubation concurrent with blastopore formation through closure, about 70 to 140 Daily Temperature Units, [deg]C. Consider withholding treatment or using an alternate therapeutant during that sensitive time to reduce egg mortalities due to drug toxicity. Finfish: Use with caution on walleye. Preharvest withdrawal time: zero days.
