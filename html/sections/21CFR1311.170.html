                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The electronic prescription application must transmit the  electronic prescription as soon as possible after signature by the  practitioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The electronic prescription application may print a prescription  that has been transmitted only if an intermediary or the designated  pharmacy notifies a practitioner that an electronic prescription was not  successfully delivered to the designated pharmacy. If this occurs, the  electronic prescription application may print the prescription for the  practitioner's manual signature. The printed prescription must include  information noting that the prescription was originally transmitted  electronically to [name of the specific pharmacy] on [date/time] and  that transmission failed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The electronic prescription application may print copies of the  transmitted prescription if they are clearly labeled: ``Copy only--not  valid for dispensing.'' Data on the prescription may be electronically  transferred to medical records, and a list of prescriptions written may  be printed for patients if the list indicates that it is for  informational purposes only and not for dispensing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The electronic prescription application must not allow the  transmission of an electronic prescription if an original prescription  was printed prior to attempted transmission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The contents of the prescription required by part 1306 of this  chapter must not be altered during transmission between the practitioner  and pharmacy. Any change to the content during transmission, including  truncation or removal of data, will render the electronic prescription  invalid. The electronic prescription data may be converted from one  software version to another between the electronic prescription  application and the pharmacy application; conversion includes altering  the structure of fields or machine language so that the receiving  pharmacy application can read the prescription and import the data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An electronic prescription must be transmitted from the  practitioner to the pharmacy in its electronic form. At no time may an  intermediary convert an electronic prescription to another form (e.g.,  facsimile) for transmission.</p>
