                                Sec. 780.811  Exemption dependent upon place of employment generally.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Under the first part of section 13(b)(15), if the employee's work  meets the requirements for exemption, the location of the place of  employment where he performs it will determine whether the exemption is  applicable. This location is required to be in a county where cotton is  grown in commercial quantities. The exemption will apply, however, to an  employee who performs such work in ``any'' place of employment in such a  county. The place of employment in which he engages in ginning need not  be an establishment exclusively or even principally devoted to such  operations; nor is it important whether the place of employment is on a  farm or in a town or city in such a county, or whether or to what extent  the cotton ginned there comes from the county in which the ginning is  done or from nearby or distant sources. It is enough if the place of  employment where the employee is engaged in ginning cotton for market is  ``located'' in such a county.    Sec. 780.812  ``County.''</p><p class="depth0">As used in the section 13(b)(15) exemption, the term ``county''  refers to the political subdivision of a State commonly known as such,  whether or not such a unit bears that name in a particular State. It  would, for example, refer to the political subdivision known as a  ``parish'' in the State of Louisiana. A place of employment would not be  located in a county, within the meaning of the exemption, if it were  located in a city which, in the particular State, was not a part of any  county.    Sec. 780.813  ``County where cotton is grown.''</p><p class="depth0">For the exemption to apply, the employee must be ginning cotton in a  place of employment in a county where cotton ``is grown'' in the  described quantities. It is the cotton grown, not the cotton ginned in  the place of employment, to which the quantity test is applicable. The  quantities of cotton ginned in the county do not matter, so long as the  requisite quantities are grown there.    Sec. 780.814  ``Grown in commercial quantities.''</p><p class="depth0">Cotton must be ``grown in commercial quantities'' in the county  where the place of employment is located if an employee ginning cotton  in such place is to be exempt under section 13(b)(15). The term  ``commercial quantities'' is not defined in the statute, but in the  cotton-growing areas of the country there should be little question in  most instances as to whether commercial quantities of cotton are grown  in the county where the ginning is done. If it should become necessary  to determine whether commercial quantities are grown in a particular  county, it would appear appropriate in view of crop-year variations to  consider average quantities produced over a representative period such  as 5 years. On the question of whether the quantities grown are  ``commercial'' quantities, the trade understanding of what are  ``commercial'' quantities of cotton would be important. It would appear  appropriate also to measure ``commercial'' quantities in terms of  marketable lint cotton in bales rather than by acreage or amounts of  seed cotton grown, since seed cotton is not a commercially marketable  product (Mangan v. State, 76 Ala. 60). Also, production of a commodity  in ``commercial'' quantities generally involves quantities sufficient  for sale with a reasonable expectation of some return to the producers  in excess of costs (Bianco v. Hess (Ariz.), 339 P. 2d 1038; Nystel v.  Thomas (Tex. Civ. App.) 42 S.W. 2d 168).</p>
