                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Optimum supply. On or about July 1 of each crop year, the Board  shall hold a meeting to review sales data, inventory data, current crop  forecasts and market conditions in order to establish an optimum supply  level for the crop year. The optimum supply volume shall be calculated  as 100 percent of the average sales of the prior three years reduced by  average sales that represent dispositions of exempt cherries and  restricted percentage cherries qualifying for diversion credit for the  same three years, unless the Board determines that it is necessary to  recommend otherwise with respect to sales of exempt and restricted  percentage cherries, to which shall be added a desirable carry-out  inventory not to exceed 20 million pounds or such other amount as the  Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. This optimum  supply volume shall be announced by the Board in accordance with  paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preliminary percentages. On or about July 1 of each crop year,  the Board shall establish a preliminary free market tonnage percentage  which shall be calculated as follows: from the optimum supply computed  in paragraph (a) of this section, the Board shall deduct the carry-in  inventory to determine the tonnage requirements (adjusted to a raw fruit  equivalent) for the current crop year which will be subtracted from the  current year USDA crop forecast or by an average of such other crop  estimates the Board votes to use. If the resulting number is positive,  this would represent the estimated overproduction which would be the  restricted tonnage. This restricted tonnage would then be divided by the  sum of the crop forecast(s) for the regulated districts to obtain a  preliminary restricted percentage, rounded to the nearest whole number,  for the regulated districts. If subtracting the current crop year  requirement, computed in the first sentence from the current crop  forecast, results in a negative number, the Board shall establish a  preliminary free market tonnage percentage of 100 percent with a  preliminary restricted percentage of zero. The Board shall announce  these preliminary percentages in accordance with paragraph (h) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interim percentages. Between July 1 and September 15 of each  crop year, the Board may modify the preliminary free market tonnage and  restricted percentages to adjust to the actual pack occurring in the  industry. The Board   shall announce any interim percentages in accordance with paragraph (h)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Final percentages. No later than September 15 of each crop year,  the Board shall review the most current information available including,  but not limited to, processed production and grower diversions of  cherries during the current crop year. The Board shall make such  adjustments as are necessary between free and restricted tonnage to  achieve the optimum supply and recommend such final free market tonnage  and restricted percentages to the Secretary and announce them in  accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. The difference between  any final free market tonnage percentage designated by the Secretary and  100 percent shall be the final restricted percentage. With its  recommendation, the Board shall report on its consideration of the  factors in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Factors. When computing preliminary and interim percentages, or  determining final percentages for recommendation to the Secretary, the  Board shall give consideration to the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The estimated total production of cherries;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The estimated size of the crop to be handled;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The expected general quality of such cherry production;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The expected carryover as of July 1 of canned and frozen  cherries and other cherry products;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The expected demand conditions for cherries in different market  segments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Supplies of competing commodities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An analysis of economic factors having a bearing on the  marketing of cherries;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The estimated tonnage held by handlers in primary or secondary  inventory reserves;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Any estimated release of primary or secondary inventory reserve  cherries during the crop year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The quantity of grower-diverted cherries during the crop year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Modification. In the event the Board subsequently deems it  advisable to modify its marketing policy, because of national emergency,  crop failure, or other major change in economic conditions, it shall  hold a meeting for that purpose, and file a report thereof with the  Secretary within 5 days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays)  after the holding of such meeting, which report shall show the Board's  recommended modification and the basis therefor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Additional tonnage to sell as free tonnage. In addition, the  Board, in years when restricted percentages are established, shall make  available tonnage equivalent to an additional 10 percent, if available,  of the average sales of the prior 3 years, as defined in paragraph (a)  of this section, for market expansion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Publicity. The Board shall promptly give reasonable publicity to  growers and handlers of each meeting to consider a marketing policy or  any modification thereof, and each such meeting shall be open to them  and to the public. Similar publicity shall be given to growers and  handlers of each marketing policy report or modification thereof, filed  with the Secretary and of the Secretary's action thereon. Copies of all  marketing policy reports shall be maintained in the office of the Board,  where they shall be made available for examination. The Board shall  notify handlers, and give reasonable publicity to growers, of its  computation of the optimum supply, preliminary percentages, and interim  percentages and shall notify handlers of the Secretary's action on final  percentages by registered or certified mail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Restricted percentages. Restricted percentage requirements  established under paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section may be  fulfilled by handlers by either establishing an inventory reserve in  accordance with Sec. 930.55 or Sec. 930.57 or by diversion of product  in accordance with Sec. 930.59. In years where required, the Board  shall establish a maximum percentage of the restricted quantity which  may be established as a primary inventory reserve such that the total  primary inventory reserve does not exceed 50-million pounds; Provided,  That such 50-million-pound quantity may be changed upon recommendation  of the Board and approval of the Secretary. Any such   change shall be recommended by the Board on or before September 30 of  any crop year to become effective for the following crop year, and the  quantity may be changed no more than one time per crop year. Handlers  will be permitted to divert (at plant or with grower diversion  certificates) as much of the restricted percentage requirement as they  deem appropriate, but may not establish a primary inventory reserve in  excess of the percentage established by the Board for restricted  cherries. In the event handlers wish to establish inventory reserve in  excess of this amount, they may do so, in which case it will be  classified as a secondary inventory reserve and will be regulated  accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Inventory Reserve Release. In years when inventory reserve  cherries are available and when the expected availability of cherries  from the current crop plus expected carryin inventory does not fulfill  the optimum supply, the Board shall release not later than November 1st  of the current crop year such volume from the inventory reserve as will  satisfy the optimum supply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish  rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of  this section.
