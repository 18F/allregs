                                Sec. 22.520  Campus access for military recruiting and Reserve Officer
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The purpose of this section is to implement 10  U.S.C. 983 as it applies to grants. Under that statute, DoD Components  are prohibited from providing funds to institutions of higher education  that have policies or practices, as described in paragraph (c) of this  section, restricting campus access of military recruiters or the Reserve  Officer Training Corps (ROTC).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By addressing the effect of 10 U.S.C. 983 on grants and  cooperative agreements, this section supplements the DoD's primary  implementation of that statute in 32 CFR part 216, ``Military Recruiting  and Reserve Officer Training Corps Program Access to Institutions of  Higher Education.'' Part 216 establishes procedures by which the  Department of Defense identifies institutions of higher education that  have a policy or practice described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition specific to this section. ``Institution of higher  education'' in this section has the meaning given at 32 CFR 216.3, which  is different than the meaning given at Sec. 22.105 for other sections of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statutory requirement of 10 U.S.C. 983. No funds made available  to the Department of Defense may be provided by grant to an institution  of higher education (including any subelement of such institution) if  the Secretary of Defense determines that the institution (or any  subelement of that institution) has a policy or practice that either  prohibits, or in effect prevents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary of a Military Department from maintaining,  establishing, or operating a unit of the Senior ROTC (in accordance with  10 U.S.C. 654 and other applicable Federal laws) at that institution (or  any subelement of that institution);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A student at that institution (or any subelement of that  institution) from enrolling in a unit of the Senior ROTC at another  institution of higher education;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary of a Military Department or Secretary of Homeland  Security from gaining access to campuses, or access to students (who are  17 years of age or older) on campuses, for purposes of military  recruiting in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to  the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other  employer; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Access by military recruiters for purposes of military  recruiting to the following information pertaining to students (who are  17 years of age or older) enrolled at that institution (or any  subelement of that institution):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Names, addresses, and telephone listings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Date and place of birth, levels of education, academic majors,  degrees received, and the most recent educational institution enrolled  in by the student.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Policy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicability to cooperative agreements. As a matter  of DoD policy, the restrictions of 10 U.S.C. 983, as implemented by 32  CFR part 216, apply to cooperative agreements, as well as grants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deviations. Grants officers may not deviate from any provision  of this section without obtaining the prior approval of the Director of  Defense Research and Engineering. Requests for deviations shall be  submitted, through appropriate channels, to: Director for Basic  Sciences, ODUSD(LABS), 3040 Defense Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20301- 3040.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Grants officers' responsibility. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A grants officer shall not  award any grant or cooperative agreement to an institution of higher  education that has been identified pursuant to the procedures of 32 CFR  part 216. Such institutions are identified as being ineligible on the  Governmentwide Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). The cause and  treatment code on the EPLS indicates the reason for an institution's  ineligibility, as well as the effect of the exclusion. Note that OMB  guidance in 2 CFR 180.425 and 180.430, as implemented by the Department  of Defense at 2 CFR part 1125, require a grants officer to check the  EPLS prior to determining that a recipient is qualified to receive an  award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A grants officer shall not consent to a subaward of DoD funds to  such an institution, under a grant or cooperative agreement to any  recipient, if the subaward requires the grants officer's consent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A grants officer shall include the following award term in each  grant or cooperative agreement with an institution of higher education  (note that this requirement does not flow down and that recipients are  not required to include the award term in subawards):</p><p class="depth3">``As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of  Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an  institution of higher education (as defined in 32 CFR part 216) that has  a policy or practice that either prohibits, or in effect prevents:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Secretary of a Military Department from maintaining,  establishing, or operating a unit of the Senior Reserve Officers  Training Corps (in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 654 and other applicable  Federal laws) at that institution (or any subelement of that  institution);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any student at that institution (or any subelement of that  institution) from enrolling in a unit of the Senior ROTC at another  institution of higher education;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The Secretary of a Military Department or Secretary of Homeland  Security from gaining access to campuses, or access to students (who are  17 years of age or older) on campuses, for purposes of military  recruiting in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to  the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other  employer; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Access by military recruiters for purposes of military  recruiting to the names of students (who are 17 years of age or older  and enrolled at that institution or any subelement of that institution);  their addresses, telephone listings, dates and places of birth, levels  of education, academic majors, and degrees received; and the most recent  educational institutions in which they were enrolled.  If the recipient is determined, using the procedures in 32 CFR part 216,  to be such an institution of higher education during the period of  performance of this agreement, the Government will cease all payments of  DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative  agreements to the recipient, and it may suspend or terminate such grants  and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the  terms and conditions of award.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an institution of higher education refuses to accept the  award term in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the grants officer  shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine that the institution is not qualified with respect to  the award. The grants officer may award to an alternative recipient.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Transmit the name of the institution, through appropriate  channels, to the Director for Accession Policy, Office of the Deputy  Under Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy (ODUSD(MPP)),  4000 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-4000. This will allow  ODUSD(MPP) to decide whether to initiate an evaluation of the  institution under 32 CFR part 216, to determine whether it is an  institution that has a policy or practice described in paragraph (c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> With respect to any pre-existing award to an institution of  higher education that currently is listed on the EPLS pursuant to a  determination under 32 CFR part 216, a grants officer:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Shall not obligate additional funds available to the DoD for the  award. A grants officer therefore must check the EPLS before approving  an incremental funding action or other additional funding for any pre- existing award to an institution of higher education. The grants officer  may not obligate the additional funds if the cause and treatment code  indicates that the reason for an institution's EPLS listing is a  determination under 32 CFR part 216 that institutional policies or  practices restrict campus access of military recruiters or ROTC.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Shall not approve any request for payment submitted by such an  institution (including payments for costs already incurred).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Shall:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Terminate the award unless he or she has a reason to believe,  after consulting with the ODUSD(MPP), 4000 Defense Pentagon, Washington,  DC 20301-4000), that the institution may be removed from the EPLS in the  near term and have its eligibility restored; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Suspend any award that is not immediately terminated, as well as  all payments under it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Post-award administration responsibilities of the Office of  Naval Research (ONR). As the DoD office assigned responsibility for  performing field administration services for grants and cooperative  agreements with institutions of higher education, the ONR shall  disseminate the list it receives from the ODUSD(MPP) of institutions of  higher education identified pursuant to the procedures of 32 CFR part  216 to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ONR field administration offices, with instructions to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Disapprove any payment requests under awards to such  institutions for which post-award payment administration was delegated  to the ONR; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Alert the DoD offices that made the awards to their  responsibilities under paragraphs (e)(5)(i) and (e)(5)(iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Awarding offices in DoD Components that may be identified from  data in the Defense Assistance Awards Data System (see 32 CFR 21.520  through 21.555) as having awards with such institutions for which post- award payment administration was not delegated to ONR. The ONR is to  alert those offices to their responsibilities under paragraph (e)(5) of  this section.  [70 FR 49465, Aug. 23, 2005, as amended at 72 FR 34988, June 26, 2007]</p>
