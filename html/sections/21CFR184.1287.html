                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Enzyme-modified refined beef fat, enzyme-modified butterfat, and enzyme-modified steam-rendered chicken fat are prepared from refined beef fat; butterfat or milkfat; and steam-rendered chicken fat, respectively, with enzymes that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Enzyme-modified milk powder may be prepared with GRAS enzymes from reconstituted milk powder, whole milk, condensed or concentrated whole milk, evaporated milk, or milk powder. The lipolysis is maintained at a temperature that is optimal for the action of the enzyme until appropriate acid development is attained. The enzymes are then inactivated. The resulting product is concentrated or dried.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ingredients must be of a purity suitable for their intended use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In accordance with Sec. 184.1(b)(1), the ingredients are used in food with no limitation other than current good manufacturing practice. The affirmation of these ingredients as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as direct human food ingredients is based upon the following current good manufacturing practice conditions of use:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ingredients are used as flavoring agents and adjuvants as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(12) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ingredients are used in food at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior sanctions for these ingredients different from the uses established in this section do not exist or have been waived.
