                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If there is a defect in your compliance with a statutory requirement, the defect is incurable if the statute does not give the Secretary authority to permit exceptions (see Sec. Sec. 3830.91 and 3833.91 of this chapter). If your payment, recording, or filing has incurable defects, the affected mining claims or sites are statutorily forfeited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If there is a defect in your compliance with a regulatory, but not statutory, requirement, the defect is curable. You may correct curable defects

when BLM gives you notice. If you fail to cure the defect within the time BLM allows, you will forfeit your mining claims or sites.
