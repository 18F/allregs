This statement must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name, address and taxpayer identification number of the electing bank;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The nature of the election being made (i.e., whether the election is to include in income more than 10 percent of the bank's net section 481(a) adjustment under Sec. 1.585-6 (b)(2) or (d)(2) or to use the cut-off method under Sec. 1.585-7); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the election is under Sec. 1.585-6(b)(2) or (d)(2), the percentage being elected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain tax returns filed before December 29, 1993.

An election under Sec. 1.585-6(b)(2), Sec. 1.585-6(d)(2) or Sec. 1.585-7(a) may be revoked

without the consent of the Commissioner on or before the final date prescribed by paragraph (a)(1) of this section for making the election. To do so, the bank that made the election must file an amended tax return for its disqualification year (or, for elections under Sec. 1.585-6(d)(2), the year for which the election was made) and attach a statement that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Includes the bank's name, address and taxpayer identification number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identifies and withdraws the previous election; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the bank is making a new election under Sec. 1.585-6(b)(2), Sec. 1.585-6(d)(2) or Sec. 1.585-7(a), contains the information described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After final date for making election.

The Commissioner will grant this consent only in extraordinary circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Elections by banks that are members of parent-subsidiary controlled groups. In the case of a bank that is a member of a parent-subsidiary controlled group (as defined in Sec. 1.585-5(d)(2)), any election under Sec. 1.585-6(b)(2), Sec. 1.585-6(d)(2) or Sec. 1.585-7(a) with respect to the bank is to be made separately by the bank. An election made by one member of such a group is not binding on any other member of the group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Elections made or revoked by amended return on or before February 28, 1994. This paragraph (e) applies to any election that a bank seeks to make under paragraph (b) of this section, or revoke under paragraph (c) of this section, by means of an amended return that is filed on or before February 28, 1994. To make or revoke an election to which this paragraph (e) applies, a bank must file (before expiration of each applicable period of limitations under section 6501) this amended return and amended returns for all taxable years after the taxable year for which the election is made or revoked by amended return, to any extent necessary to report the bank's tax liability in a manner consistent with the making or revoking of the election by amended return.
