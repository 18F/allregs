                            <p class="depth0">Post Offices are established and maintained at locations deemed  necessary to ensure that regular and effective postal services are  available to all customers within specified geographic boundaries. A  Post Office may be operated or staffed by a postmaster or by another  type of postal employee at the direction of the postmaster, including  when the postmaster is not physically present. A Remotely Managed Post  Office (RMPO) is a Post Office that offers part-time window service  hours, is staffed by a Postal Service employee under the direction of a  postmaster, and reports to an Administrative Post Office. A Part-Time  Post Office (PTPO) is a Post Office that offers part-time window service  hours, is staffed by a Postal Service employee, and reports to a  district office. Unless otherwise specified, all references to ``Post  Office'' include RMPOs and PTPOs.  [77 FR 46950, Aug. 7, 2012]</p>
