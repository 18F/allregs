A license will not be issued until a completed Form DSP-83 has been received by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. This form is to be executed by the foreign consignee, foreign end-user, and the applicant. The certificate stipulates that, except as specifically authorized by prior written approval of the Department of State, the foreign consignee and foreign end-user will not reexport, resell or otherwise dispose of the significant military equipment enumerated in the application outside the country named as the location of the foreign end-use or to any other person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may also require a DSP-83 for the export of any other defense articles, including technical data, or defense services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a DSP-83 is required for an export of any defense article or defense service to a non-governmental foreign end-user, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may require as a condition of issuing the license that the appropriate authority of the government of the country of ultimate destination also execute the certificate.
