                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the information required by Sec. 98.3(c), each  annual report must contain the following information for each landfill.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A classification of the landfill as ``open'' (actively received  waste in the reporting year) or ``closed'' (no longer receiving waste),  the year in which the landfill first started accepting waste for  disposal, the last year the landfill accepted waste (for open landfills,  enter the estimated year of landfill closure), the capacity (in metric  tons) of the landfill, an indication of whether leachate recirculation  is used during the reporting year and its typical frequency of use over  the past 10 years (e.g., used several times a year for the past 10  years, used at least once a year for the past 10 years, used  occasionally but not every year over the past 10 years, not used), an  indication as to whether scales are present at the landfill, and the  waste disposal quantity for each year of landfilling required to be  included when using Equation HH-1 of this subpart (in metric tons, wet  weight).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method for estimating reporting year and historical waste  disposal quantities, reason for its selection, and the range of years it  is applied. For years when waste quantity data are determined using the  methods in Sec. 98.343(a)(3), report separately the quantity of waste  determined using the methods in Sec. 98.343(a)(3)(i) and the quantity  of waste determined using the methods in Sec. 98.343(a)(3)(ii). For  historical waste disposal quantities that were not determined using the  methods in Sec. 98.343(a)(3), provide the population served by the  landfill for each year the Equation HH-2 of this subpart is applied, if  applicable, or, for open landfills using Equation HH-3 of this subpart,  provide the value of landfill capacity (LFC) used in the calculation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waste composition for each year required for Equation HH-1 of  this subpart, in percentage by weight, for each waste category listed in  Table HH-1 to this subpart that is used in Equation HH-1 of this subpart  to calculate the annual modeled CH4 generation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For each waste type used to calculate CH4 generation  using Equation HH-1 of this subpart, you must report:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Degradable organic carbon (DOC) and fraction of DOC dissimilated  (DOCF) values used in the calculations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Decay rate (k) value used in the calculations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fraction of CH4 in landfill gas (F), an indication of  whether the fraction of CH4 was determined based on measured  values or the default value, and the methane correction factor (MCF)  used in the calculations. If an MCF other than the default of 1 is used,  provide an indication of whether active aeration of the waste in the  landfill was conducted during the reporting year, a description of the  aeration system, including aeration blower capacity, the fraction of the  landfill containing waste affected by aeration, the total number of  hours during the year the aeration blower was operated, and other  factors used as a basis for the selected MCF value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The surface area of the landfill containing waste (in square  meters), identification of the type of cover material used (as either  organic cover, clay cover, sand cover, or other soil mixtures). If  multiple cover types are used, the surface area associated with each  cover type.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The modeled annual methane generation rate for the reporting  year (metric tons CH4) calculated using Equation HH-1 of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For landfills without gas collection systems, the annual methane  emissions (i.e., the methane generation, adjusted for oxidation,  calculated using Equation HH-5 of this subpart), reported in metric tons  CH4, the oxidation fraction used in the calculation, and an  indication of whether passive vents and/or passive flares (vents or  flares that are not considered part of the gas collection system as  defined in Sec. 98.6) are present at this landfill.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> For landfills with gas collection systems, you must report:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Total volumetric flow of landfill gas collected for destruction  for the reporting year (cubic feet at 520 [deg]R or 60 degrees  Fahrenheit and 1 atm).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Annual average CH4 concentration of landfill gas  collected for destruction (percent by volume).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monthly average temperature and pressure for each month at which  flow is measured for landfill gas collected for destruction, or  statement that temperature and/or pressure is incorporated into internal  calculations run by the monitoring equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An indication as to whether flow was measured on a wet or dry  basis, an indication as to whether CH4 concentration was  measured on a wet or dry basis, and if required for Equation HH-4 of  this subpart, monthly average moisture content for each month at which  flow is measured for landfill gas collected for destruction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An indication of whether destruction occurs at the landfill  facility, off-site, or both. If destruction occurs at the landfill  facility, also report for each measurement location the number of  destruction devices associated with that measurement location and the  annual operating hours and the destruction efficiency (percent) for each  destruction device associated with that measurement location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Annual quantity of recovered CH4 (metric tons  CH4) calculated using Equation HH-4 of this subpart for each  measurement location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A description of the gas collection system (manufacturer,  capacity, and number of wells), the surface area (square meters) and  estimated waste depth (meters) for each area specified in Table HH-3 to  this subpart, the estimated gas collection system efficiency for  landfills with this gas collection system, the annual operating hours of  the gas collection system for each measurement location, and an  indication of whether passive vents and/or passive flares (vents or  flares that are not considered part of the gas collection system as  defined in Sec. 98.6) are present at the landfill.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Methane generation corrected for oxidation calculated using  Equation HH-5 of this subpart, reported in metric tons CH4,  and the oxidation fraction used in the calculation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Methane generation (GCH4) value used as an input to  Equation HH-6 of this subpart. Specify whether the value is modeled  (GCH4 from HH-1 of this subpart) or measured (R from Equation  HH-4 of this subpart).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Methane generation corrected for oxidation calculated using  Equation HH-7 of this subpart, reported in metric tons CH4,  and the oxidation fraction used in the calculation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Methane emissions calculated using Equation HH-6 of this  subpart, reported in metric tons CH4, and the oxidation  fraction used in the calculation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Methane emissions calculated using Equation HH-8 of this  subpart, reported in metric tons CH4, and the oxidation  fraction used in the calculation.
