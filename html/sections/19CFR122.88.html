This written notification shall contain the following language: ``Notice to all boarding passengers: You are boarding an aircraft on which passengers will be arriving in the U.S. from foreign destinations. These passengers have not yet cleared U.S. Customs. Accordingly, you will be subject to a full reinspection by Customs at your final U.S. port of entry.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Domestic (stopover) passengers shall be provided a Customs declaration identified by the words ``Domestic Flight''. The domestic (stopover) passenger is only required to complete items 1-4 on that declaration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The carrier shall present to Customs, as otherwise required by law, the permit to proceed and/or the general declaration, clearly stating the number of domestic (stopover) passengers to be reinspected upon arrival at the destination port (intermediate or final) where an inspection of passengers is to take place.</p>
