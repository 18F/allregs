                            <p class="depth0">Leptospira Grippotyphosa Bacterin shall be produced from a culture  of Leptospira grippotyphosa which has been inactivated and is nontoxic.  Each serial of biological product containing Leptospira grippotyphosa  fraction shall meet the applicable requirements in Sec. 113.100 and  shall be tested for purity, safety, and potency as prescribed in this  section. A serial found unsatisfactory by any prescribed test shall not  be released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purity test. Final container samples of completed product from  each serial and each subserial shall be tested for viable bacteria and  fungi as provided in Sec. 113.26.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Safety test. Bulk or final container samples of completed  product from each serial shall be tested for safety as provided in Sec.  113.38.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Potency test. Bulk or final container samples of completed  product shall be diluted with physiological saline so that each 0.25 ml  contains not more than 1/800th of the dose recommended on the label and  shall be tested for potency, using the two-stage test provided in this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vaccinates. Inject each of at least 10 but not more than 12  young adult hamsters, each weighing 50 to 90 grams, with 0.25 ml of the  diluted bacterin either subcutaneously or intramuscularly, in accordance  with the label recommendations for use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Controls. Retain at least 10 but not more than 12 additional  hamsters from the same group as unvaccinated controls.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Challenge. From 14 to 18 days postvaccination, challenge each of  10 vaccinates and each of 10 controls intraperitoneally with a  suspension of virulent Leptospira grippotyphosa organisms, using a dose  of 10-10,000 hamster LD50 as determined by titration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Post-challenge period. Observe the vaccinates and controls for  14 days post-challenge and record all deaths. If eight or more controls  die of leptospirosis, the test is valid and the results shall be  evaluated according to the following table:</p><p class="depth3">Cumulative Totals ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Dead hamsters for        Dead hamsters for</p><p class="depth3">Stage                    Number of vaccinates          acceptance               rejection ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1....................................  10.....................  2 or less..............  5 or more. 2....................................  20.....................  5 or less..............  6 or more. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If three or four vaccinates die in the first stage, the second  stage shall be conducted in a manner identical to the first stage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the second stage is used, each serial shall be evaluated  according to the second part of the table. On the basis of cumulative  results, each serial shall either pass or fail.  [40 FR 17003, Apr. 16, 1975, as amended at 40 FR 23989, June 4, 1975; 45  FR 40100, June 13, 1980.
