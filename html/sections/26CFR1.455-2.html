                                Sec. 1.455-2  Scope of election under section 455.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a taxpayer makes an election under section 455 and  Sec. 1.455-6 with respect to a trade or business, all prepaid  subscription income from such trade or business shall be included in  gross income for the taxable years during which the liability exists to  furnish or deliver a newspaper, magazine, or other periodical. Such  election shall be applicable to all prepaid subscription income received  in connection with the trade or business for which the election is made;  except that the taxpayer may further elect to include in gross income  for the taxable year of receipt (as described in section 455(d)(3) and  paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.455-5) the entire amount of any prepaid  subscription income if the liability from which it arose is to end  within 12 months after the date of   receipt, hereinafter sometimes referred to as ``within 12 months''  election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the taxpayer is engaged in more than one trade or business in  which a liability is incurred to furnish or deliver a newspaper,  magazine, or other periodical, a separate election 455 with respect to  each such trade or business. In addition, a taxpayer may make a separate  ``within 12 months'' election for each separate trade or business for  which it has made an election under section 455.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An election made under section 455 shall be binding for the  first taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent  taxable years, unless the taxpayer secures the consent of the  Commissioner to the revocation of such election. Thus, in any case where  the taxpayer has elected a method prescribed by section 455 for the  inclusion of prepaid subscription income in gross income, such method of  reporting income may not be changed without the prior approval of the  Commissioner. In order to secure the Commissioner's consent to the  revocation of such election, an application must be filed with the  Commissioner in accordance with section 446(e) and the regulations  thereunder. For purposes of subtitle A of the Code, the computation of  taxable income under an election made under section 455 shall be treated  as a method of accounting. For adjustments required by changes in method  of accounting, see section 481 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An election made under section 455 shall not apply to any  prepaid subscription income received before the first taxable year to  which the election applies. For example, Corporation M, which computes  its taxable income under an accrual method of accounting and files its  income tax returns on the calendar year basis, publishes a monthly  magazine and customarily sells subscriptions on a 3-year basis. In 1958  it received $135,000 of 3-year prepaid subscription income for  subscriptions beginning during 1958, and in 1959 it received $142,000 of  prepaid subscription income for subscriptions beginning after December  31, 1958. In February 1959 it elected, with the consent of the  Commissioner, to report its prepaid subscription income under the  provisions of section 455 for the year 1959 and subsequent taxable  years. The $135,000 received in 1958 from prepaid subscriptions must be  included in gross income in full in that year, and no part of such 1958  income shall be allocated to the years 1959, 1960, and 1961 during which  M was under a liability to deliver its magazine. The $142,000 received  in 1959 from prepaid subscriptions shall be allocated to the years 1959,  1960, 1961, and 1962.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No election may be made under section 455 with respect to a  trade or business if, in computing taxable income, the cash receipts and  disbursements method of accounting is used with respect to such trade or  business. However, if the taxpayer is on a ``combination'' method of  accounting under section 446(c)(4) and the regulations thereunder, it  may elect the benefits of section 455 if it uses an accrual method of  accounting for subscription income  [T.D. 6591, 27 FR 1798, Feb. 27, 1962]</p>
