                                Sec.  203.80  When can I get royalty relief if I am not eligible for royalty
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">We may grant royalty relief when it serves the statutory purposes  summarized in Sec.  203.1 and our formal relief programs, including but  not limited to the applicable levels of the royalty suspension volumes  and price thresholds, provide inadequate encouragement to promote  development or increase production. Unless your lease lies offshore of  Alaska or wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in the  GOM, your lease must be producing to qualify for relief. Before you may  apply for royalty relief apart from our programs for end-of-life leases  or for pre-Act deep water leases and development and expansion projects,  we must agree that your lease or project has two or more of the  following characteristics:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The lease has produced for a substantial period and the lessee  can recover significant additional resources. Significant additional  resources mean enough to allow production for at least a year more than  would be profitable without royalty relief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Valuable facilities (e.g., a platform or pipeline that would be  removed upon lease relinquishment) exist that we do not expect a  successor lessee to use. If the facilities are located off the lease,  their preservation must depend on continued production from the lease  applying for royalty relief. We will only consider an allocable share of  costs for off-lease facilities in the relief application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A substantial risk exists that no new lessee will recover the  resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The lessee made major efforts to reduce operating costs too  recently to use the formal program for royalty relief (e.g., recent  significant change in operations).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Circumstances beyond the lessee's control, other than water  depth, preclude reliance on one of the existing royalty relief programs.</p><p class="depth2">Required Reports</p>
