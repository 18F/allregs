                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> TF emissions from potlines. Using the procedures in Sec.  63.847  and in the approved test plan, the owner or operator shall monitor  emissions of TF from each potline by conducting monthly performance  tests. The owner or operator shall compute and record the monthly  average from at least three runs for secondary emissions and the  previous 12-month average of all runs for the primary control system to  determine compliance with the applicable emission limit. The owner or  operator must include all valid runs in the monthly average. The  duration of each run for secondary emissions must represent a complete  operating cycle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> POM emissions from Soderberg potlines. Using the procedures in  Sec.  63.847 and in the approved test plan, the owner or operator shall  monitor emissions of POM from each Soderberg (HSS, VSS1, and VSS2)  potline every three months. The owner or operator shall compute and  record the quarterly (3-month) average from at least one run per month  for secondary emissions and the previous 12-month average of all runs  for the primary control systems to determine compliance with the  applicable emission limit. The owner or operator must include all valid  runs in the quarterly (3-month) average. The duration of each run for  secondary emissions must represent a complete operating cycle. The  primary control system must be sampled over an 8-hour period, unless  site-specific factors dictate an alternative sampling time subject to  the approval of the regulatory authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> TF and POM emissions from anode bake furnaces. Using the  procedures in Sec.  63.847 and in the approved test plan, the owner or  operator shall monitor TF and POM emissions from each anode bake furnace  on an annual basis. The owner or operator shall compute and record the  annual average of TF and POM emissions from at least three runs to  determine compliance with the applicable emission limits. The owner or  operator must include all valid runs in the annual average.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(7)</em> of this section. Two or more potlines are similar if the  owner or operator demonstrates that their structure, operability, type  of emissions, volume of emissions, and concentration of emissions are  substantially equivalent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To demonstrate (to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority)  that the level of emission control performance is the same or better,  the owner or operator shall perform an emission test using an  alternative monitoring procedure for the similar potline simultaneously  with an emission test using the applicable test methods. The results of  the emission test using the applicable test methods must be in  compliance with the applicable emission limit for existing or new  potlines in Sec.  63.843 or Sec.  63.844. An alternative method:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For TF emissions, must account for or include gaseous fluoride  and cannot be based on measurement of particulate matter or particulate  fluoride alone; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For TF and POM emissions, must meet or exceed Method 14  criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An HF continuous emission monitoring system is an approved  alternative for the monitoring of TF secondary emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An owner or operator electing to use an alternative monitoring  procedure shall establish an alternative emission limit based on at  least nine simultaneous runs using the applicable test methods and the  alternative monitoring method. All runs must represent a full process  cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator shall derive an alternative emission limit  for the HF continuous emission monitor or an alternative method using  either of the following procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use the highest value from the alternative method associated  with a simultaneous run by the applicable test method that does not  exceed the applicable emission limit; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Correlate the results of the two methods (the applicable test  method results and the alternative monitoring method results) and  establish an emission limit for the alternative monitoring system that  corresponds to the applicable emission limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The owner or operator shall submit the results required in  paragraph (d)(4) of this section and all supporting documentation to the  applicable regulatory authority for review and approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The regulatory authority shall review and approve or disapprove  the request for an alternative method and alternative emission limit.  The criterion for approval shall be a demonstration (to the satisfaction  of the regulatory authority) that the alternative method and alternative  emission limit achieve a level of emission control that is the same as  or better than the level that would have otherwise been achieved by the  applicable method and emission limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the alternative method is approved by the applicable  regulatory authority, the owner or operator shall perform monthly  emission monitoring using the approved alternative monitoring procedure  to demonstrate compliance with the alternative emission limit for each  similar potline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reduced sampling frequency. The owner or operator may submit a  written request to the applicable regulatory authority to establish an  alternative testing requirement to reduce the sampling of secondary TF  emissions from potlines from monthly to quarterly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submit data from 24 consecutive months of sampling that show the  average TF emissions are less than 60 percent of the applicable limit  and that no monthly performance test in the 24 months of sampling  exceeds 75 percent of the applicable limit; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Submit data and a statistical analysis that the regulatory  authority may evaluate based on the approach used in ``Primary Aluminum:  Statistical Analysis of Potline Fluoride Emissions and Alternative  Sampling Frequency'' (EPA-450-86-012, October 1986), which is available  from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal  Road, Springfield, VA 22161.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An approved alternative requirement must include a test schedule  and the method to be used to measure emissions for performance tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator of a plant that has received approval of  an alternative sampling frequency under Sec.  60.194 of this chapter is  deemed to have approval of the alternative sampling frequency under this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If emissions in excess of the applicable TF limit occur while  performing quarterly sampling approved under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this  section, the owner or operator shall return to monthly sampling for at  least 12 months and may reduce to quarterly sampling when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The average of all tests performed over the most recent 24-month  period does not exceed 60 percent of the applicable limit, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No more than one monthly performance test in the most recent  24-month period exceeds 75 percent of the applicable limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If emissions in excess of the applicable TF limit occur while  performing quarterly sampling approved under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of  this section, the owner or operator shall immediately return to the  monthly sampling schedule required by paragraph (a) of this section  until another request for an alternative sampling frequency is approved  by the applicable regulatory authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Monitoring parameters for emission control devices. The owner or  operator shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a continuous  parameter monitoring system for each emission control device. The owner  or operator shall submit for approval by the regulatory authority a  description of the parameter(s) to be monitored, the operating limits,  and the monitoring frequency to ensure that the control device is being  properly operated and maintained. An explanation of the criteria used  for selection of the parameter(s), the operating limits, and the  monitoring frequency, including how these relate to emission control  also shall be submitted to the regulatory authority. Except as provided  in paragraph (l) of this section, the following monitoring devices shall  be installed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For dry alumina scrubbers, devices for the measurement of  alumina flow and air flow;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For dry coke scrubbers, devices for the measurement of coke flow  and air flow;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For wet scrubbers as the primary control system, devices for the  measurement of water flow and air flow;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For electrostatic precipitators, devices for the measurement of  voltage and secondary current; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For wet roof scrubbers for secondary emission control:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A device for the measurement of total water flow; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator shall inspect each control device at  least once each operating day to ensure the control device is operating  properly and record the results of each inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Visible emissions. The owner or operator shall visually inspect  the exhaust stack(s) of each control device on a daily basis for  evidence of any visible emissions indicating abnormal operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em>, if visible emissions indicating abnormal  operation are observed from the exhaust stack of a control device during  a daily inspection, or if a problem is detected during the daily  inspection of a wet roof scrubber for potline secondary emission  control, the owner or operator shall initiate corrective action  procedures within 1 hour. Failure to initiate the corrective action  procedures within 1 hour or to take the necessary corrective actions to  remedy the problem is a violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Exceedances. If the limit for a given operating parameter  associated with monitoring a specific control device is exceeded six  times in any semiannual reporting period, then any subsequent exceedance  in that reporting period is a violation. For the purpose of determining  the number of exceedances, no more than one exceedance shall be  attributed in any given 24-hour period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Weight of aluminum and green anodes. The owner or operator of a  new or existing potline or anode bake furnace shall install, operate,  and maintain a monitoring device to determine the daily weight of  aluminum produced and the weight of green anode material placed in the  anode bake furnace. The weight of green anode material may be determined  by monitoring the weight of all anodes or by monitoring the number of  anodes placed in the furnace and determining an average weight from  measurements of a representative sample of anodes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Accuracy and calibration. The owner or operator shall submit  recommended accuracy requirements to the regulatory authority for review  and approval. All monitoring devices required by this section must be  certified by the owner or operator to meet the accuracy requirements and  must be calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Alternative operating parameters. The owner or operator may  monitor alternative control device operating parameters subject to prior  written approval by the applicable regulatory authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Other control systems. An owner or operator using a control  system not identified in this section shall request that the applicable  regulatory authority include the recommended parameters for monitoring  in the facility's part 70 permit.
