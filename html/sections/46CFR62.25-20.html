Minimum instrumentation and alarms required for specific types of automated vital systems are listed in Table 62.35-50.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Instrumentation Location. (1) Manual control locations, including remote manual control and manual alternate control, must be provided with the instrumentation necessary for safe operation from that location.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Typically, instrumentation includes means to monitor the output of the monitored system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Systems with remote instrumentation must have provisions for the installation of instrumentation at the monitored system equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The status of automatically or remotely controlled vital auxiliaries, power sources, switches, and valves must be visually indicated in the machinery spaces or the cognizant remote control location, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Status indicators include run, standby, off, open, closed, tripped, and on, as applicable. Status indicators at remote control locations other than the ECC, if provided, may be summarized. Equipment normally provided with status indicators are addressed in Table 62.35-50 and subparts 58.01, 56.50, and 112.45.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Sequential interlocks provided in control systems to ensure safe operation, such as boiler programming control or reversing of propulsion diesels, must have summary indicators in the machinery spaces and at the cognizant control location to show if the interlocks are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Instrumentation listed in Table 62.35-50 must be of the continuous display type or the demand display type. Displays must be in the ECC or in the machinery spaces if an ECC is not provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Instrumentation details.

Red beacons must only be used for general or fire alarm purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Automatic transfer to required backup or redundant systems or power sources must be alarmed in the machinery spaces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Flooding safety, fire, loss of power, and engineers' assistance-needed alarms extended from the machinery spaces to a remote location must not have a duty crewmember selector.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Other alarms may be provided with such a selector, provided there is no off position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Automation alarms must be separate and independent of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The fire detection and alarm systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The general alarm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> CO2/halon release alarms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Failure of an automatic control, remote control, or alarm system must be immediately alarmed in the machinery spaces and at the ECC, if provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Alarm details.

Visual alarms at a control location that are summarized or grouped by function, system, or item of equipment must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Be sufficiently specific to allow any necessary action to be taken; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Have a display at the equipment or an appropriate control location to identify the specific alarm condition or location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Central control locations.
