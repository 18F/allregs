                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Analytical methodology. Air carriers must follow the sampling and analysis requirements under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The standard sample volume required for total coliform analysis, regardless of analytical method used, is 100 mL.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Air carriers need determine only the presence or absence of total coliforms and/or E. coli; a determination of density of these organisms is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Air carriers must conduct analyses for total coliform and E. coli in accordance with the analytical methods approved in Sec.  141.21(f)(3) and 141.21(f)(6)) until March 31, 2016, and in accordance with the analytical methods approved in Sec.  141.852 beginning April 1, 2016.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The time from sample collection to initiation of analysis may not exceed 30 hours. Systems are encouraged but not required to hold samples below 10 [deg]C during transit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The invalidation of a total coliform sample result can be made only by the Administrator in accordance with Sec.  141.21(c)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) or by the certified laboratory in accordance with Sec.  141.21(c)(2) until March 31, 2016, or in accordance with Sec.  141.853(c) beginning April 1, 2016, with the Administrator acting as the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Certified laboratories. For the purpose of determining compliance with this subpart, samples may be considered only if they have been analyzed by a laboratory certified by a State or EPA. For the purposes of this paragraph, ``State'' refers to a State or Tribe that has received primacy for public water systems (other than aircraft water systems) under section 1413 of SDWA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Routine monitoring.

Restrict public access to the aircraft water system in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section as expeditiously as possible, but in no case later than 24 hours after the laboratory notifies the air carrier of the E. coli-positive result or discovery of the applicable failure as specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. All public access restrictions, including applicable public notification requirements, must remain in-place until the aircraft water system has been disinfected and flushed and a complete set of follow-up samples is total coliform-negative; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Disinfect and flush. Conduct disinfection and flushing in accordance with Sec.  141.804(b)(2). If the aircraft water system cannot be physically disconnected or shut-off, or the flow of water otherwise prevented through the tap(s), then the air carrier must disinfect and flush the system no later than 72 hours after the laboratory notifies the air carrier of the E. coli-positive result or discovery of the applicable failure as specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Follow-up sampling.

If any routine sample is total coliform-positive and E. coli-negative, then the air carrier must perform at least one of the following three corrective actions and continue through with that action until a complete set of follow-up or repeat samples is total coliform-negative:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Disinfect and flush. In accordance with Sec.  141.804(b)(2), conduct disinfection and flushing of the system no later than 72 hours after the laboratory notifies the air carrier of the total coliform-positive and E. coli-negative result.

Collect three 100 mL repeat samples no later than 24 hours after the laboratory notifies the air carrier of the routine total coliform-positive and E. coli-negative result. Repeat samples must be collected and analyzed from three taps within the aircraft as follows: The tap which resulted in the total coliform-positive sample, one other lavatory tap, and one other galley tap. If fewer than three taps exist, then a total of three 100 mL samples must be collected and analyzed from the available taps within the aircraft water system.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If all repeat samples are total coliform-negative, then the air carrier must maintain the routine monitoring frequency for total coliform as specified in the sampling plan in Sec.  141.802.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If any repeat sample is E. coli-positive, the air carrier must perform all the corrective actions as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), and (c)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If any repeat sample is total coliform-positive and E. coli-negative, then the air carrier must perform the corrective actions specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) or (c)(3)(ii) of this section, and continue through with that action until a complete set of follow-up samples is total coliform-negative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Restriction of public access.
