                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever the Chairman of the Commission is of the opinion that joint deliberation among the members of the Commission upon any matter is unnecessary in light of the nature of the matter, impracticable, or would impede the orderly disposition of agency business, but is of the view that such matter should be the subject of a vote of the Commission, such matter may be disposed of by circulation of any relevant materials concerning the matter. The relevant materials shall be circulated to each member of the Commission, unless a member is unavailable or has determined not to participate in the matter. A written record of the vote of each participating Commission member shall be reported to the Secretariat who shall retain it in the records of the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever any member of the Commission so requests, any matter circulated for disposition pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be withdrawn from circulation and scheduled instead for a Commission meeting.
