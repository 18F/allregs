                            <p class="depth0">An employer employing workers under Sec. Sec.  655.200-655.235 may use a mobile unit, camper, or other similar mobile housing vehicle, tents, and remotely located stationary structures along herding trails, which meet the following standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Housing site. Range housing sites must be well drained and free from depressions where water may stagnate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Water supply. (1) An adequate and convenient supply of water that meets the standards of the state or local health authority must be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The employer must provide each worker at least 4.5 gallons of potable water, per day, for drinking and cooking, delivered on a regular basis, so that the workers will have at least this amount available for their use until this supply is next replenished. Employers must also provide an additional amount of water sufficient to meet the

laundry and bathing needs of each worker. This additional water may be non-potable, and an employer may require a worker to rely on natural sources of water for laundry and bathing needs if these sources are available and contain water that is clean and safe for these purposes. If an employer relies on alternate water sources to meet any of the workers' needs, it must take precautionary measures to protect the worker's health where these sources are also used to water the herd, dogs, or horses, to prevent contamination of the sources if they collect runoff from areas where these animals excrete.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The water provided for use by the workers may not be used to water dogs, horses, or the herd.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In situations where workers are located in areas that are not accessible by motorized vehicle, an employer may request a variance from the requirement that it deliver potable water to workers, provided the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It seeks the variance at the time it submits its H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification, Form ETA-9142A;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It attests that it has identified natural sources of water that are potable or may be easily rendered potable in the area in which the housing will be located, and that these sources will remain available during the period the worker is at that location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> It attests that it shall provide each worker an effective means to test whether the water is potable and, if not potable, the means to easily render it potable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The CO approves the variance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Individual drinking cups must be provided; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Containers appropriate for storing and using potable water must be provided and, in locations subject to freezing temperatures, containers must be small enough to allow storage in the housing unit to prevent freezing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Excreta and liquid waste disposal. (1) Facilities, including shovels, must be provided and maintained for effective disposal of excreta and liquid waste in accordance with the requirements of the state health authority or involved Federal agency; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If pits are used for disposal by burying of excreta and liquid waste, they must be kept fly-tight when not filled in completely after each use. The maintenance of disposal pits must be in accordance with state and local health and sanitation requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Housing structure. (1) Housing must be structurally sound, in good repair, in a sanitary condition and must provide shelter against the elements to occupants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Housing, other than tents, must have flooring constructed of rigid materials easy to clean and so located as to prevent ground and surface water from entering;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each housing unit must have at least one window that can be opened or skylight opening directly to the outdoors; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Tents appropriate to weather conditions may be used only where the terrain and/or land use regulations do not permit the use of other more substantial housing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Heating. (1) Where the climate in which the housing will be used is such that the safety and health of a worker requires heated living quarters, all such quarters must have properly installed operable heating equipment that supplies adequate heat. Where the climate in which the housing will be used is mild and the low temperature for any day in which the housing will be used is not reasonably expected to drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, no separate heating equipment is required as long as proper protective clothing and bedding are made available, free of charge or deposit charge, to the workers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any stoves or other sources of heat using combustible fuel must be installed and vented in such a manner as to prevent fire hazards and a dangerous concentration of gases. If a solid or liquid fuel stove is used in a room with wooden or other combustible flooring, there must be a concrete slab, insulated metal sheet, or other fireproof material on the floor under each stove, extending at least 18 inches beyond the perimeter of the base of the stove.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any wall or ceiling within 18 inches of a solid or liquid fuel stove or stove pipe must be made of fireproof material. A vented metal collar must

be installed around a stovepipe or vent passing through a wall, ceiling, floor or roof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When a heating system has automatic controls, the controls must be of the type that cuts off the fuel supply when the flame fails or is interrupted or whenever a predetermined safe temperature or pressure is exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A heater may be used in a tent if the heater is approved by a testing service and if the tent is fireproof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Lighting. (1) In areas where it is not feasible to provide electrical service to range housing units, including tents, lanterns must be provided (kerosene wick lights meet the definition of lantern); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Lanterns, where used, must be provided in a minimum ratio of one per occupant of each unit, including tents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Bathing, laundry, and hand washing. Bathing, laundry and hand washing facilities must be provided when it is not feasible to provide hot and cold water under pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Food storage. When mechanical refrigeration of food is not feasible, the worker must be provided with another means of keeping food fresh and preventing spoilage, such as a butane or propane gas refrigerator. Other proven methods of safeguarding fresh foods, such as dehydrating or salting, are acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cooking and eating facilities. (1) When workers or their families are permitted or required to cook in their individual unit, a space must be provided with adequate lighting and ventilation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Wall surfaces next to all food preparation and cooking areas must be of nonabsorbent, easy to clean material. Wall surfaces next to cooking areas must be made of fire-resistant material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Garbage and other refuse. (1) Durable, fly-tight, clean containers must be provided to each housing unit, including tents, for storing garbage and other refuse; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provision must be made for collecting or burying refuse, which includes garbage, at least twice a week or more often if necessary, except where the terrain in which the housing is located cannot be accessed by motor vehicle and the refuse cannot be buried, in which case the employer must provide appropriate receptacles for storing the refuse and for removing the trash when the employer next transports supplies to the location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Insect and rodent control. Appropriate materials, including sprays, and sealed containers for storing food, must be provided to aid housing occupants in combating insects, rodents and other vermin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Sleeping facilities. A separate comfortable and clean bed, cot, or bunk, with a clean mattress, must be provided for each person, except in a family arrangement, unless a variance is requested from and granted by the CO. When filing an application for certification and only where it is demonstrated to the CO that it is impractical to provide a comfortable and clean bed, cot, or bunk, with a clean mattress, for each range worker, the employer may request a variance from this requirement to allow for a second worker to join the range operation. Such a variance must be used infrequently, and the period of the variance will be temporary, i.e., the variance shall be for no more than 3 consecutive days. Should the CO grant the variance, the employer must supply a sleeping bag or bed roll for the second occupant free of charge or deposit charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Fire, safety, and first aid. (1) All units in which people sleep or eat must be constructed and maintained according to applicable state or local fire and safety law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No flammable or volatile liquid or materials may be stored in or next to rooms used for living purposes, except for those needed for current household use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Housing units for range use must have a second means of escape through which the worker can exit the unit without difficulty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Tents are not required to have a second means of escape, except when large tents with walls of rigid material are used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Adequate, accessible fire extinguishers in good working condition and first aid kits must be provided in the range housing.
