                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> OFCCP may conduct compliance evaluations to determine if the  contractor is taking affirmative action to employ, advance in  employment, and otherwise treat qualified individuals without  discrimination on the basis of disability in all employment practices. A  compliance evaluation may consist of any one or any combination of the  following investigative procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliance review. A comprehensive analysis and evaluation of  the hiring and employment practices of the contractor, the written  affirmative action program, and the results of the affirmative action  efforts undertaken by the contractor. A compliance review may proceed in  three stages:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A desk audit of the written affirmative action program and  supporting documentation to determine whether all elements required by  the regulations in this part are included, whether the affirmative  action program meets agency standards of reasonableness, and whether the  affirmative action program and supporting documentation satisfy agency  standards of acceptability. OFCCP may extend the temporal scope of the  desk audit beyond that set forth in the scheduling letter if OFCCP deems  it necessary to carry out its investigation of potential violations of  this part. The desk audit is conducted at OFCCP offices;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An on-site review is conducted at the contractor's  establishment to investigate unresolved problem areas identified in the  affirmative action program and supporting documentation during the desk  audit, to verify that the contractor has implemented the affirmative  action program and has complied with those regulatory obligations not  required to be included in the affirmative action program, and to  examine potential instances or issues of discrimination. An on-site  review normally will involve an examination of the contractor's  personnel and employment policies, inspection and copying of documents  related to employment actions, and interviews with employees,  supervisors, managers, hiring officials; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where necessary, an off-site analysis of information supplied  by the contractor or otherwise gathered during or pursuant to the on- site review;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Off-site review of records. An analysis and evaluation of the  affirmative action program (or any part thereof) and supporting  documentation, and other documents related to the contractor's personnel  policies and employment actions that may be relevant to a determination  of whether the contractor has complied with the requirements of section  503 and its regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compliance check. A determination of whether the contractor has  maintained records consistent with Sec. 60-741.80; OFCCP may request  the documents be provided either on-site or off-site; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Focused review. A review restricted to one or more components of  the contractor's organization or one or more aspects of the contractor's  employment practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where deficiencies are found to exist, reasonable efforts shall  be made to secure compliance through conciliation and persuasion  pursuant to Sec. 60-741.62.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pre-award compliance evaluations. Each agency will include in  the invitation for bids for each formally advertised nonconstruction  contract or state at the outset of negotiations for each negotiated  contract, that if the award, when let, should total $10 million or more,  the prospective contractor and its known first-tier subcontractors with  subcontracts of $10 million or more will be subject to a compliance  evaluation before the award of the contract unless OFCCP has conducted  an evaluation and found them to be in compliance with section 503 within  the preceding 24 months. The awarding agency will notify OFCCP and  request appropriate action and findings in accordance with this  subsection. Within 15 days of the notice, OFCCP will inform the awarding  agency of its intention to conduct a pre-award compliance evaluation. If  OFCCP does not inform the awarding agency within that period of its  intention to conduct a pre-award compliance evaluation, clearance shall  be presumed and the awarding agency is authorized to proceed with the   award. If OFCCP informs the awarding agency of its intention to conduct  a pre-award compliance evaluation, OFCCP will be allowed an additional  20 days after the date that it so informs the awarding agency to provide  its conclusions. If OFCCP does not provide the awarding agency with its  conclusions within that period, clearance will be presumed and the  awarding agency is authorized to proceed with the award.</p>
