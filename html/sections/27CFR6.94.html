                            <p class="depth0">An industry member may give or sponsor educational seminars for  employees of retailers either at the industry member's premises or at  the retail establishment. Examples would be seminars dealing with use of  a retailer's equipment, training seminars for employees of retailers, or  tours of industry member's plant premises. This section does not  authorize an industry member to pay a retailer's expense in conjunction  with an educational seminar (such as travel and lodging). This does not  preclude providing nominal hospitality during the event.  [T.D. ATF-74, 45 FR 63251, Sept. 23, 1980, as amended by T.D. ATF-364,  60 FR 20423, Apr. 26, 1995]</p>
