                            <p class="depth0">Section 86.1817-08 includes text that specifies requirements that  differ from Sec. 86.1817-05. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.1817-05 is  identical and applicable to Sec. 86.1817-08, this may be indicated by  specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved].  For guidance see Sec. 86.1817-05.'' This section does not apply for  NOX or NMOG+NOX emissions for vehicles certified  to the Tier 3 standards in Sec. 86.1816-18, including those vehicles  that certify to the Tier 3 standards before model year 2018. See  Secs. 86.1860 and 86.1861 for provisions that apply for vehicles  certified to the Tier3 standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> through (o) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.1817-05.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> The following provisions apply for model year 2008 and later  engines. These provisions apply instead of the provisions of paragraphs  Sec. 86.1817-05 (a) through (o) to the extent that they are in conflict.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturers of Otto-cycle vehicles may participate in an NMHC  averaging, banking and trading program to show compliance with the  standards specified in Sec. 86.1806-08. The generation and use of NMHC  credits are subject to the same provisions in paragraphs Sec. 86.1817-05  (a) through (o) that apply for NOX credits, except as  otherwise specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>. This results in a total  discount of 0.8 (0.9 x 0.888 = 0.8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Credits are to be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a  Megagram.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To calculate credits relative to the NOX standards  listed in Sec. 86.1816-08 (a)(1)(iv)(A) or (a)(2)(iv)(A) (0.2 or 0.4  grams per mile, respectively) express the standard and FEL to the  nearest one-hundredth of a gram per mile prior to calculating the  credits. Thus, either 0.20 or 0.40 should be used as the value for  ``Std''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Credits generated for 2008 and later model year test groups are  not discounted (except as specified in Sec. 86.1817-05(c) and paragraph  (p)(2) of this section), and do not expire.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For the purpose of using or generating credits during a phase-in  of new standards, a manufacturer may elect to split a test group into  two subgroups: one which uses credits and one which generates credits.  The manufacturer must indicate in the application for certification that  the test group is to be split, and may assign the numbers and  configurations of vehicles within the respective subfamilies at any time  prior to the submission of the end-of-year report described in  Sec. 86.1817-05 (i)(3). Manufacturers certifying a split test group may  label all of the vehicles within that test group with the same FELs:  either with a NOX FEL and an NMHC FEL, or with a single  NOX+NMHC FEL. The FEL(s) on the label will apply for all SEA  or other compliance testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Vehicles meeting all of the applicable standards of  Sec. 86.1816-08 prior to model year 2008 may generate NMHC credits for  use by 2008 or later test groups. Credits are calculated according to  Sec. 86.1817-05(c), except that the applicable FEL cap listed in  Sec. 86.1816-08(a)(1)(ii)(B) or (2)(ii)(B) applies instead of ``Std''  (the applicable standard).
