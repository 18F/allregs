The terms U.S. No. 1, U.S. Commercial, U.S. No. 2, Size B, slightly skinned, and moderately skinned shall have the same meaning as when used in the U.S. Standards for Potatoes (7 CFR 2851.1540-2851.1566), including the tolerances set forth therein. The term other processing has the same meaning as the term appearing in the act and includes, but is not restricted to, potatoes for dehydration, chips, shoestrings, starch, and flour. It includes only that preparation of potatoes for market which involves the application of heat or cold to such an extend that the natural form or stability of the commodity undergoes a substantial change. The act of peeling, cooling, slicing, dicing, or applying material to prevent oxidation does not constitute ``other processing.'' The term manufacture or conversion into specified products means the preparation of potatoes for market into products by peeling, slicing, dicing, applying material to prevent oxidation, or other means approved by the committee, but not including other processing. Other terms used in this section shall have the same meaning as when used in Marketing Agreement No. 97, as amended, and this part.
