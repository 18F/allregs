                                Sec. 1002.213  How can the employee demonstrate a reasonable certainty   or she had remained continuously employed during the period of service?

                            <p class="depth0">A reasonable certainty is a high probability that the employee would  have received the seniority or seniority-based right or benefit if he or  she had been continuously employed. The employee does not have to  establish that he or she would have received the benefit as an absolute  certainty. The employee can demonstrate a reasonable certainty that he  or she would have received the seniority right or benefit by showing  that other employees with seniority similar to that which the employee  would have had if he or she had remained continuously employed received  the right or benefit. The employer cannot withhold the right or benefit  based on an assumption that a series of unlikely events could have  prevented the employee from gaining the right or benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Disabled Employees</p>
