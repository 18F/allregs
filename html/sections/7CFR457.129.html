                            <p class="depth0">The fresh market sweet corn crop insurance provisions for the 2008  and succeeding crop years for all counties with a contract change date  on or after the effective date of this rule and for the 2009 and  succeeding crop years for all counties with a contract change date prior  to the effective date of this rule, as follows:  FCIC Policies</p><p class="depth0">Department of Agriculture</p><p class="depth0">Federal Crop Insurance Corporation</p><p class="depth0">Reinsured Policies</p><p class="depth0">(Appropriate title for insurance provider)  Both FCIC and Reinsured Policies</p><p class="depth0">Fresh Market Sweet Corn Crop Provisions</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Allowable cost. The dollar amount per container for harvesting,  packing, and handling as shown in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">Amount of insurance (per acre). The dollar amount of coverage per  acre obtained by multiplying the reference maximum dollar amount shown  on the actuarial documents by the coverage level percentage you elect.</p><p class="depth0">Average net value per container. The dollar amount obtained by  totaling the net values of all containers of sweet corn sold and  dividing the result by the total number of containers of all sweet corn  sold.</p><p class="depth0">Container. The unit of measurement for the insured crop as specified  in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">Crop year. In lieu of the definition of ``crop year'' contained in  section 1 of the Basic Provisions, for counties with fall, winter, and  spring planting periods or counties with fall and spring planting  periods, the period of time that begins on the first day of the earliest  planting period for fall planted sweet corn and continues through the  last day of the insurance period for spring planted sweet corn. For  counties with only spring planting periods, the period of time that  begins on the earliest planting period for spring planted sweet corn and  continues through the last day of the insurance period for spring  planted sweet corn. The crop year is designated by the calendar year in  which spring planted sweet corn is harvested.</p><p class="depth0">Direct marketing. Sale of the insured crop directly to consumers  without the intervention of an intermediary such as a wholesaler,  retailer, packer, processor, shipper or buyer. Examples of direct  marketing include selling   through an on-farm or roadside stand, farmer's market, and permitting  the general public to enter the field for the purpose of picking all or  a portion of the crop.</p><p class="depth0">Harvest. Separation of ears of sweet corn from the plant by hand or  machine.</p><p class="depth0">Marketable sweet corn. Sweet corn that is sold for any purpose or  grades U.S. No. 1 or better in accordance with the requirements of the  United States Standards for Grades of Sweet Corn.</p><p class="depth0">Minimum value. The dollar amount per container shown in the Special  Provisions we will use to value marketable production to count.</p><p class="depth0">Net value. The dollar value of packed and sold sweet corn obtained  by subtracting the allowable cost and any additional charges specified  in the Special Provisions from the gross value per container of sweet  corn sold. This result may not be less than zero.</p><p class="depth0">Plant stand. The number of live plants per acre prior to the  occurrence of an insurable cause of loss.</p><p class="depth0">Planted acreage. In addition to the definition contained in the  Basic Provisions, for each planting period, sweet corn seed must be  planted in rows far enough apart to permit mechanical cultivation,  unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, actuarial  documents, or by written agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Planting period. The period of time designated in the actuarial  documents in which sweet corn must be planted to be considered fall,  winter, or spring-planted sweet corn.</p><p class="depth0">Potential production. The number of containers of sweet corn that  the sweet corn plants will or would have produced per acre by the end of  the insurance period, assuming normal growing conditions and practices.</p><p class="depth0">Practical to replant. In lieu of the definition in section 1 of the  Basic Provisions, our determination, after loss or damage to the insured  crop, based on factors, including but not limited to moisture  availability, condition of the field, marketing windows, and time to  crop maturity, that replanting to the insured crop will allow the crop  to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of the  insurance period (inability to obtain seed will not be considered when  determining if it is practical to replant).</p><p class="depth0">Sweet corn. A type of corn with kernels containing a high percentage  of sugar that is adapted for human consumption as a vegetable.</p><p class="depth0">2. Unit Division</p><p class="depth0">A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, will  also be established for each planting period.</p><p class="depth0">3. Amounts of Insurance and Production Stages</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic  Provisions, you may select only one coverage level (and the  corresponding amount of insurance designated in the actuarial documents  for the applicable planting period and practice) for all the sweet corn  in the county insured under this policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amount of insurance you choose for each planting period and  practice must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price  offered by us for each planting period and practice. For example, if you  choose 100 percent of the maximum amount of insurance for a specific  planting period and practice, you must also choose 100 percent of the  maximum amount of insurance for all other planting periods and  practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 of  the Basic Provisions do not apply to sweet corn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If specified in the Special Provisions, we will limit your  amount of insurance per acre if you have not produced the minimum amount  of production of sweet corn contained in the Special Provisions in at  least one of the three most recent crop years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The amounts of insurance are progressive by stages as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Percent of</p><p class="depth0">the amount</p><p class="depth0">of</p><p class="depth0">Stage          insurance               Length of time</p><p class="depth0">per acre</p><p class="depth0">that you</p><p class="depth0">selected ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1...................           65  From planting through the beginning</p><p class="depth0">of tasseling (which is when the</p><p class="depth0">tassel becomes visible above the</p><p class="depth0">whorl). Final...............          100  From tasseling until the acreage is</p><p class="depth0">harvested. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The indemnity payable for any acreage of sweet corn will be  based on the stage the plants had achieved when damage occurred. Any  acreage of sweet corn damaged in the first stage to the extent that the  majority of producers in the area would not normally further care for it  will have an amount of insurance based on the first stage for the  purposes of establishing an indemnity even if you continue to care for  the damaged sweet corn.</p><p class="depth0">4. Contract Changes</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract  change date shown   below is the date preceding the cancellation date:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">State and county                           Date ------------------------------------------------------------------------ All Florida counties; and all Georgia      April 30.</p><p class="depth0">counties for which the Special</p><p class="depth0">Provisions designate a fall planting</p><p class="depth0">period.

All other States........................  March 15. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">6. Report of Acreage</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements of section 6 of the Basic  Provisions, you must report on or before the acreage reporting date  contained in the Special Provisions for each planting period, all the  acreage of sweet corn in the county insured under this policy in which  you have a share.</p><p class="depth0">7. Annual Premium</p><p class="depth0">In lieu of the premium amount determinations contained in section 7  of the Basic Provisions, the annual premium amount for each cultural  practice (e.g., fall-planted irrigated) is determined by multiplying the  final stage amount of insurance per acre by the premium rate for the  cultural practice as established in the Actuarial Table, by the insured  acreage, by your share at the time coverage begins, and by any  applicable premium adjustment factors contained in the actuarial  documents.</p><p class="depth0">8. Insured Crop</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop  insured will be all the sweet corn in the county for which a premium  rate is provided by the actuarial documents:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In which you have a share;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> That is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Planted to be harvested and sold as fresh market sweet corn;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Planted within the planting periods designated in the actuarial  documents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Grown under an irrigated practice, unless otherwise provided in  the Special Provisions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Grown by a person who in at least one of the three previous crop  years:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Grew sweet corn for commercial sale; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Participated in managing a sweet corn farming operation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> That is not:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Interplanted with another crop;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Planted into an established grass or legume; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Grown for direct marketing, unless otherwise provided in the  Special Provisions or by written agreement.</p><p class="depth0">9. Insurable Acreage</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions  any acreage of sweet corn damaged during the planting period in which  initial planting took place:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Must be replanted if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Less than 75 percent of the plant stand remains;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is practical to replant; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The final day of the planting period has not passed at the time  the crop was damaged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Whenever sweet corn is initially planted during the fall or  winter planting periods and the final planting date for the planting  period has passed, but it is considered practical to replant, you may  elect:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To replant such acreage and collect any replant payment due as  specified in section 12. The initial planting period coverage will  continue for such replanted acreage; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Not to replant such acreage and receive an indemnity based on  the stage of growth the plants had attained at the time of damage.  However, such an election will result in the acreage being uninsurable  in the subsequent planting period.</p><p class="depth0">10. Insurance Period</p><p class="depth0">In lieu of the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions,  coverage begins on each unit or part of a unit the later of the date we  accept your application, or when the sweet corn is planted in each  planting period. Coverage ends at the earliest of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Total destruction of the sweet corn on the unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Abandonment of the sweet corn on the unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The date harvest should have started on the unit on any acreage  which will not be harvested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Final adjustment of a loss on the unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Final harvest; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> 100 days after the date of planting or replanting, unless  otherwise provided in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">11. Causes of Loss</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic  Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of  loss that occur during the insurance period:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adverse weather conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fire;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Wildlife;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Volcanic eruption;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Earthquake;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper  application of pest control measures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper  application of disease control measures; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured  cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the  Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss due to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Failure to harvest in a timely manner unless harvest is  prevented by one of the insurable causes of loss specified in section  11(a); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Failure to market the sweet corn unless such failure is due to  actual physical damage caused by an insured cause of loss as specified  in section 11(a). For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you  are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any  person to accept production.</p><p class="depth0">12. Replanting Payments</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with section 13 of the Basic Provisions, a  replanting payment is allowed if, due to an insured cause of loss, more  than 25 percent of the plant stand will not produce sweet corn and it is  practical to replant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be  the lesser of your actual cost of replanting or the result obtained by  multiplying the per acre replanting payment amount contained in the  Special Provisions by your insured share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In lieu of the provisions contained in section 13 of the Basic  Provisions, limiting a replanting payment to one each crop year, only  one replanting payment will be made for acreage planted during each  planting period within the crop year.</p><p class="depth0">13. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements contained in section 14 of the Basic  Provisions, if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> You also must give us notice not later than 72 hours after the  earliest of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The time you discontinue harvest of any acreage on the unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date harvest normally would start if any acreage on the unit  will not be harvested; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The calendar date for the end of the insurance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If insurance is permitted by the Special Provisions or by  written agreement on acreage with production that will be sold by direct  marketing, you must notify us at least 15 days before any production  from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an  appraisal that will be used to determine the value of your production to  count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs  after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal if you  notify us that additional damage has occurred. These appraisals, and/or  any acceptable production records provided by you, will be used to  determine the value of your production to count.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by  direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to  count of not less than the dollar amount of insurance (per acre) for the  applicable stage if such failure results in our inability to accurately  determine the value of production.</p><p class="depth0">14. Settlement of Claim</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you  are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for  which such production records were not provided; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production  to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage  for each unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will  settle your claim by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiplying the insured acreage in each stage by the amount of  insurance per acre for the final stage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiplying each result in section 14(b)(1) by the percentage  for the applicable stage (see section 3(e));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Totalling the results of section 14(b)(2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Subtracting either of the following values from the result of  section 14(b)(3):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For other than catastrophic risk protection coverage, the total  value of production to be counted (see section 14(c)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For catastrophic risk protection coverage, the result of  multiplying the total value of production to be counted (see section  14(c)) by fifty-five percent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Multiplying the result of section 14(b)(4) by your share.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">------------------------------------------------------------------------- For example:</p><p class="depth0">You have a 100 percent share in 65.3 acres of fresh market sweet</p><p class="depth0">corn in the unit (15.0 acres in stage 1 and 50.3 acres in the final</p><p class="depth0">stage), with a dollar amount of insurance of $600 per acre. The</p><p class="depth0">15.0 acre field was damaged by flood and appraisals of the crop</p><p class="depth0">determined there was no potential production to be counted. From</p><p class="depth0">the 50.3 acre field, you are only able to harvest 5,627 containers</p><p class="depth0">of sweet corn. The net value of all sweet corn production sold</p><p class="depth0">($3.11 per container) is greater than the Minimum Value per</p><p class="depth0">container ($2.50). The 5,627 containers sold x $3.11 average net</p><p class="depth0">value per container = $17,500 value of your production to count.</p><p class="depth0">Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1 15.0 acres x $600 amount of insurance = $9,000 and</p><p class="depth0">50.3 acres x $600 amount of insurance = $30,180;</p><p class="depth0">2 $9,000 x .65 (percent for stage 1) = $5,850 and</p><p class="depth0">$30,180 x 1.00 (percent for final stage) = $30,180;</p><p class="depth0">3 $5,850 + $30,180 = $36,030 amount of insurance for the unit;</p><p class="depth0">4 $36,030-$17,500 value of production to count = $18,530 loss;</p><p class="depth0">5 $18,530 x 100 percent share = $18,530 indemnity payment. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The total value of production to count from all insurable  acreage on the unit will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Not less than the amount of insurance per acre for the stage for  any acreage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That is abandoned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Put to another use without our consent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> That is damaged solely by uninsured causes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For which you fail to provide acceptable production records; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> From which insurable production is sold by direct marketing and  you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 13(b) of these  Crop Provisions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The value of the following appraised sweet corn production will  not be less than the dollar amount obtained by multiplying the number of  containers of appraised sweet corn by the minimum value for the planting  period:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Unharvested marketable sweet corn production (unharvested  production that is damaged or defective due to insurable causes and is  not marketable will not be counted as production to count unless such  production is later harvested and sold for any purpose);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Production lost due to uninsured causes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put  to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount  of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that  acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the  crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> We may require you to continue to care for the crop so that a  subsequent appraisal may be made or the crop harvested to determine  actual production (If we require you to continue to care for the crop  and you do not do so, the original appraisal will be used); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> You may elect to continue to care for the crop, in which case  the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested  production, or our reappraisal if the crop is not harvested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The value of all harvested production of sweet corn from the  insurable acreage, except production that is sold by direct marketing as  specified in section (c)(4) below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For sold production, will be the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The dollar amount obtained by multiplying the total number of  containers of sweet corn sold by the minimum value; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The dollar amount obtained by multiplying the average net value  per container from all sweet corn sold by the total number of all  containers of sweet corn sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For marketable sweet corn production that is not sold, will be  the dollar amount obtained by multiplying the number of containers of  such sweet corn by the minimum value for the planting period. Harvested  production that is damaged or defective due to insurable causes and is  not marketable will not be counted as production to count unless such  production is sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If all the requirements of insurability are met, the value of  insurable production that is sold by direct marketing will be the  greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The actual value received by you for direct marketed production;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The dollar amount obtained by multiplying the total number of  containers of appraised sweet corn sold by direct marketing by the  minimum value.</p><p class="depth0">15. Late and Prevented Planting</p><p class="depth0">The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions  are not applicable.</p><p class="depth0">16. Minimum Value Option</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of this option are continuous and will be  attached to and made a part of your insurance policy, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You elect the Minimum Value Option on your application, or on a  form approved by us, on or before the sales closing date for   the initial crop year in which you wish to insure sweet corn under this  option, and pay the additional premium indicated in the actuarial  documents for this optional coverage; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You have not elected coverage under the Catastrophic Risk  Protection Endorsement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In lieu of the provisions contained in section 14(c)(3) of these  Crop Provisions, the total value of harvested production that is not  sold by direct marketing will be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The dollar amount obtained by multiplying the average net value  per container from all sweet corn sold (this result may not be less than  the minimum value option amount if such amount is provided in the  Special Provisions) by the total number of all containers of sweet corn  sold;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For marketable sweet corn production that is not sold, the value  of such production will be the dollar amount obtained by multiplying the  total number of containers of such sweet corn by the minimum value for  the planting period.
