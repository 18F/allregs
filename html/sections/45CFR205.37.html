The initial advance automatic data  processing planning document must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A requirements analysis, including consideration of the program  mission, functions, organization, services, constraints and current  support relating to such system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the proposed statewide management system,  including the description of information flows, input data formats,  output reports and uses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The security and interface requirements to be employed in such  statewide management system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the projected resource requirements including  staff and other needs; and the resources available or expected to be  available to meet these requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A cost benefit analysis of alternative systems designs, data  processing services and equipment in terms of qualitative and  quantitative measures.   The alternative systems considered should include the advantages of the  proposed system over the alternatives and should indicate the period of  time the system will be operated to justify the funds invested. ACF  certified systems that are already in place in other States must be  included in the alternatives to be considered and evaluated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A plan for distribution of costs, containing the basis for  rates, both direct and indirect, to be in effect under such a statewide  management system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An implementation plan with charts of development events,  testing description, proposed acceptance criteria, and backup and  fallback procedures to handle possible failure of a system; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Evidence that the State's system will be compatible with those  of the FSA to facilitate the exchange of data between the State and  Federal system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ACF shall on a continuing basis, review, assess, and inspect the  planning, design, and operation of, statewide management information  systems, with a view to determining whether, and to what extent, these  systems meet and continue to meet the requirements under these  regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If ACF finds that any statewide management information system  referred to in Sec. 205.38 fails to comply substantially with criteria,  requirements, and other undertakings prescribed by the approved advance  automatic data processing planning document, approval of such document  shall be suspended. The State will be given written notice of the  suspension. The notice of suspension will state the reason for the  suspension, whether the suspended system complies with the criteria for  50 percent FFP under 45 CFR part 95, the actions required for future  Federal funding, and the effective date of the suspension. The  suspension shall be effective as of the date that the system failed to  comply substantially with the approved APD. The suspension shall remain  in effect until ACF makes a determination that such system complies with  prescribed criteria, requirements, and other undertakings for future  Federal funding. Should a State cease development of their approved  system, either by voluntary withdrawal or as a result of Federal  suspension, all Federal incentive funds invested to date that exceed the  normal administrative FFP rate (50 percent) will be subject to  recoupment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> ACF shall provide technical assistance to States as is deemed  necessary to assist States to plan, design, develop, or install and  provide for the security of the management information systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Approvals of the systems by ACF under the provisions of this  section will be undertaken only as a result of State applications for  increased matching. The requirements of 45 CFR part 95, subpart E and  subpart F apply.
