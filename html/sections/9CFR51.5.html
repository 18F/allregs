The veterinarian in charge may extend the time limit to 30 days when a request for such extension is received by him prior to the expiration date of the original 15 day period allowed, and when he determines that the extension will not adversely affect the brucellosis eradication program; and except further, that the Administrator shall upon request in specific cases, extend the time limit beyond the 30-day period when unusual or unforeseen circumstances occur which prevent or hinder the identification of the animals within the 30-day period, such as, but not limited to, floods, storms, or other Acts of God which are beyond the control of the owner, or when identification is delayed due to requirements of another Federal Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, cattle and bison to be destroyed because of brucellosis shall be individually identified prior to moving interstate by attaching to the left ear a metal tag bearing a serial number and the inscription ``U.S. Reactor,'' or a similar State reactor tag, and must be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``B'' branded (as defined in Sec. 78.1); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accompanied directly to slaughter by an APHIS or State representative; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Moved in vehicles closed with official seals applied and removed by an APHIS representative, State representative, accredited veterinarian, or an individual authorized for this purpose by an APHIS representative.
