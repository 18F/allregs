                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. A regulated article shall not be moved unless it complies with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, unless a variance has been granted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. \12\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\12\ The requirements of this section are in addition to and not in lieu of any other packing requirements such as those for the transportation of etiologic agents prescribed by the Department of Transportation in Title 49 CFR or any other agency of the Federal government.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Container requirements--(1) Plants and plant parts. All plants or plant parts, except seeds, cells, and subcellular elements, shall be packed in a sealed plastic bag of at least 5 mil thickness, inside a sturdy, sealed, leak-proof, outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrogated cardboard, wood, or other material of equivalent strength.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Plants and plant parts. All plants or plant parts, except seeds, cells, and subcellular elements, shall be packed in a sealed plastic bag of at least 5 mil thickness, inside a sturdy, sealed, leak-proof, outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrogated cardboard, wood, or other material of equivalent strength.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Seeds. All seeds shall be transported in a sealed plastic bag of at least 5 mil thickness, inside a sealed metal container, which shall be placed inside a second sealed metal container. Shock absorbing cushioning material shall be placed between the inner and outer metal containers. Each metal container shall be independently capable of protecting the seeds and preventing spillage or escape. Each set of metal containers shall then be enclosed in a sturdy outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material of equivalent strength.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Live microorganisms and/or etiologic agents, cells, or subcellular elements. All regulated articles which are live (non-

inactivated) microorganisms, or etiologic agents, cells, or subcellular elements shall be packed as specified below:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Volume not exceeding 50 ml. Regulated articles not exceeding 50 ml shall be placed in a securely closed, watertight container (primary container, test tube, vial, etc.) which shall be enclosed in a second, durable watertight container (secondary container). Several primary containers may be enclosed in a single secondary container, if the total volume of all the primary containers so enclosed does not exceed 50 ml. The space at the top, bottom, and sides between the primary and secondary containers shall contain sufficient nonparticulate absorbent material (e.g., paper towel) to absorb the entire contents of the primary container(s) in case of breakage or leakage. Each set of primary and secondary containers shall then be enclosed in an outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material of equivalent strength.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Volume greater than 50 ml. Regulated articles which exceed a volume of 50 ml. shall comply with requirements specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. In addition, a shock absorbing material, in volume at least equal to that of the absorbent material between the primary and secondary containers, shall be placed at the top, bottom, and sides between the secondary container and the outer shipping container. Single primary containers shall not contain more than 1,000 ml. of material. However, two or more primary containers whose combined volumes do not exceed 1,000 ml. may be placed in a single, secondary container. The maximum amount of micro-organisms or etiologic agents, cells, or subcellular elements which may be enclosed within a single outer shipping container shall not exceed 4,000 ml.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Dry ice. If dry ice is used as a refrigerant, it shall be placed outside the secondary container(s). If dry ice is used between the secondary container and the outer shipping container, the shock absorbing material shall be placed so that the secondary container does not become loose inside the outer shipping container as the dry ice sublimates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Insects, mites, and related organisms. Insects, mites, and other small arthropods shall be packed for shipment as specified in this paragraph or in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Insects (any life stage) shall be placed in an escape-proof primary shipping container (insulated vacuum container, glass, metal, plastic, etc.) and sealed to prevent escape. Such primary container shall be placed securely within a secondary shipping container of crushproof styrofoam or other material of equivalent strength; one or more rigid ice packs may also be placed within the secondary shipping container; and sufficient packing material shall be added around the primary container to prevent movement of the primary shipping container. The secondary (styrofoam or other) container shall be placed securely within an outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material of equivalent strength.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other macroscopic organisms. Other macroscopic organisms not covered in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (4) of this section which do not require continuous access to atmospheric oxygen shall be packaged as specified in paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section. All macroscopic organisms which are not plants and which require continuous access to atmospheric oxygen shall be placed in primary shipping containers constructed of a sturdy, crush-proof frame of wood, metal, or equivalent strength material, surrounded by escape-proof mesh or netting of a strength and mesh size sufficient to prevent the escape of the smallest organism in the shipment, with edges and seams of the mesh or netting sealed to prevent escape of organisms. Each primary shipping container shall be securely placed within a larger secondary shipping container constructed of wood, metal, or equivalent strength material. The primary and secondary shipping containers shall then be placed securely within an outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material of

equivalent strength, which outer container may have air holes or spaces in the sides and/or ends of the container, provided that the outer shipping container must retain sufficient strength to prevent crushing of the primary and secondary shipping containers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request for a variance from container requirements. A responsible person who believes the container requirements normally applicable to the movement of the person's regulated article(s) are inappropriate due to unique circumstances (such as the nature, volume, or life stage of the regulated article) may submit in an application for a permit, a request for a variance from the container requirements. The request for a variance under this section shall consist of a short statement describing why the normally applicable container requirements are inappropriate for the regulated article which the person proposes to move and what container requirements the person would use in lieu of the normally prescribed container requirements. USDA shall advise the responsible person in writing at the time a permit is granted on the person's request for a variance.
