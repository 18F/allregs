The environmental limits to which the system has  been satisfactorily validated must be documented in the appropriate  propeller manuals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A method is provided to indicate that an operating mode change  has occurred if flight crew action is required. In such an event,  operating instructions must be provided in the appropriate manuals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The propeller control system must be designed and constructed so  that, in addition to compliance with Sec. 35.15:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No single failure or malfunction of electrical or electronic  components in the control system results in a hazardous propeller  effect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failures or malfunctions directly affecting the propeller  control system in a typical airplane, such as structural failures of  attachments to the control, fire, or overheat, do not lead to a  hazardous propeller effect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The loss of normal propeller pitch control does not cause a  hazardous propeller effect under the intended operating conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The failure or corruption of data or signals shared across  propellers does not cause a hazardous propeller effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Electronic propeller control system imbedded software must be  designed and implemented by a method approved by the Administrator that  is consistent with the criticality of the performed functions and that  minimizes the existence of software errors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The propeller control system must be designed and constructed so  that the failure or corruption of airplane-supplied data does not result  in hazardous propeller effects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The propeller control system must be designed and constructed so  that the loss, interruption or abnormal characteristic of airplane- supplied electrical power does not result in hazardous propeller  effects.
