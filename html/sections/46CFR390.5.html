The rules in this section  further define such terms and state how vessels must be listed on  Schedules A and B in the agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible agreement vessels--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. An eligible  agreement vessel, which may be used to establish ceilings for deposit  purposes, is any vessel:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Constructed in the United States, and if reconstructed,  reconstructed in the United States; the term constructed or  reconstructed in the United States includes any vessel which was  constructed or reconstructed outside of the United States but documented  under the laws of the United States on April 15, 1970, or constructed or  reconstructed outside of the United States for use in the United States  foreign commerce pursuant to a contract entered into before April 15,  1970;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Documented under the laws of the United States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operated in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United  States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Engaged primarily in the waterborne carriage of men, materials,  goods or wares; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Designated in the agreement as an ``eligible agreement vessel.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Scope of the term ``eligible agreement vessel.'' For purposes of  generating ceilings for deposits under 46 U.S.C. 53505 and the joint  regulations the term eligible agreement vessel includes any:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tug or barge;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Vessels which have been contracted for or are in the process of  construction; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Share interest in a vessel; the party is considered to have a  share interest in an eligible agreement vessel if the party has the  right to use the vessel to generate income or a right to the proceeds or  a portion of the proceeds from its use even if the party does not have a  proprietary interest in the vessel for purposes of State or Federal law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Foreign or domestic commerce. For the purpose of paragraph  (b)(1)(iii) of this section the term foreign or domestic commerce means  the water-borne carriage of men, materials, goods or wares between:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Two points in the United States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A point in the United States and a point in a foreign country;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Two points in the same foreign country or points in two  different foreign countries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Qualified agreement vessels--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. A qualified  agreement vessel which may be acquired, constructed or reconstructed  with the aid of qualified withdrawals, is any vessel:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Constructed in the United States, and if reconstructed,  reconstructed in the United States; the term constructed or  reconstructed in the United States includes any vessel which was  constructed or reconstructed outside of the United States but documented  under the laws of the United States on April 15, 1970, or constructed or  reconstructed outside of the United States for use in the United States  foreign commerce pursuant to a contract entered into before April 15,  1970;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Documented under the laws of the United States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operated in the United States foreign, Great Lakes,  noncontiguous domestic, or short sea transportation trade.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Engaged primarily in the water-borne carriage of men,  materials, goods or wares; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Designated in the agreement as a ``qualified agreement vessel.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Scope of the term ``qualified agreement vessel.'' For purposes  of making qualified withdrawals under 46 U.S.C. 53509 and the joint  regulations the term qualified agreement vessel includes any:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cargo handling equipment which the Maritime Administrator  determines will be used primarily on a qualified agreement vessel.  Normally any auxiliary equipment which is ordinarily carried from port  to port, excluding equipment that needs frequent replacement due to  normal wear and tear, and is used in conjunction with the loading or  unloading of the vessel is deemed to be cargo handling equipment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ocean-going towing vessel or barge which the Maritime  Administrator determines is suitable for the trade in which the party  intends to operate such vessel or barge, or any comparable vessel or  barge operated on the Great Lakes which is suitable for its intended  trade; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Proprietary interest in a qualified agreement vessel as, for  example, that which may result from a joint venture or partnership.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Foreign trade.

Permissible operations for qualified  agreement vessels include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Foreign-to-foreign trade in the case of vessels operating as  part of U.S.-flag service and carrying cargo originating in or destined  for U.S. ports, i.e., U.S.-flag feeder vessels;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Foreign-to-foreign trade, including the lightering of foreign- flag vessels, in the case of vessels carrying liquid or dry bulk cargoes  when the carrier has demonstrated to the Administrator:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The need for such foreign-to-foreign shipments (as required by  46 U.S.C. 109 and paragraph (c)(iii) of this section), and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> That the proposed cargo would qualify as liquid or dry bulk  cargo;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ship assist work, including lightering or shifting of a vessel  at the end or beginning of a noncontiguous domestic, short sea  transportation trade, Great Lakes or U.S. foreign trade voyage. In  addition, the lightering of foreign-flag vessels in U.S. ports is  permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> United States construction. An agreement vessel is considered to  be of United States construction if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is built entirely in a shipyard or shipyards within any of  the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All components of the hull and superstructure are fabricated in  the United States; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The vessel is assembled entirely in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agreement vessels--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition.

The complement is limited to three  times the container, trailer or barge capacity of the vessel, unless the  Maritime Administrator shall agree to a different complement.
