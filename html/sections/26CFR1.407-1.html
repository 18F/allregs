                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. For purposes of applying the rules in  part 1 of subchapter D of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code and the  regulations thereunder with respect to a pension, profit-sharing, or  stock bonus plan described in section 401(a), an annuity plan described  in section 403(a), or a bond purchase plan described in section 405(a),  of a domestic parent corporation (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of  this section), an individual who is a citizen of the United States and  who is an employee of a domestic subsidiary (as defined in paragraph  (b)(3)(i) of this section) of such domestic parent corporation shall be  treated as an employee of such domestic parent corporation if the  requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cross-references. For rules relating to nondiscrimination  requirements and the determination of compensation, see paragraph (c) of  this section. For rules under which termination of the status of an  individual as an employee of the domestic parent corporation in certain  instances will not be considered as separation from service for certain  purposes, see paragraph (d) of this section. For rules regarding  deductibility of contributions, see paragraph (e) of this section. For  rules regarding treatment of such individual as an employee of the  domestic parent corporation under related provisions, see paragraph (f)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application of this section--(1) Requirements. This section  shall apply and the employee of the domestic subsidiary shall be treated  as an employee of the domestic parent corporation for the purposes set  forth in paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section only if each of the following  requirements is satisfied:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The plan, referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, must  expressly provide for contributions of benefits for individuals who are  citizens of the United States and who are employees of one or more of  the domestic subsidiaries of the domestic parent corporation. The plan  must apply to every domestic subsidiary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contributions under a funded plan of deferred compensation  (whether or not a plan described in section 401(a), 403(a), or 405(a))  must not be provided by any other person with respect to the  remuneration paid to such individual by the domestic subsidiary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Supplementary rules. Subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph does  not modify the requirements for qualification of a plan described in  section 401(a), 403(a), or 405(a) and the regulations thereunder. It is  not necessary that the plan provide benefits or contributions for all  United States citizens who are employees of such domestic subsidiaries.  It   the plan is amended to cover individuals who are employees by reason of  paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the plan will not qualify unless it  meets the coverage requirements of section 410(b)(1) (section 401(a)(3),  as in effect on September 1, 1974, for plan years to which section 410  does not apply; see Sec. 1.410 (a)-2 for the effective dates of section  401) and the nondiscrimination requirements of section 410(a)(4). The  administrative rules contained in Sec. 1.401 (a)-3(e) (relating to the  determination of the contributions or benefits provided by the employer  under the Social Security Act) will also apply for purposes of  determining whether the plan meets the requirements of section 401. For  purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, contributions will  not be considered as provided under a funded plan merely because the  domestic subsidiary employer pays the tax imposed by section 3111  (relating to tax on employers under the Federal Insurance Contributions  Act) with respect to such employee or is required under the laws of a  foreign jurisdiction to pay social insurance taxes or to make similar  payments with respect to the wages paid to the employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Domestic subsidiary. For purposes of this  section, a corporation shall be treated as a domestic subsidiary for any  taxable year only if each of the following requirements is satisfied:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> It is a domestic corporation 80 percent or more of the  outstanding voting stock of which is owned by another domestic  corporation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> 95 percent of more of its gross income for the three-year period  immediately preceding the close of its taxable year which ends on or  before the close of the taxable year of such other domestic corporation  (or for such part of such period during which it was in existence) was  derived from sources without the United States, determined pursuant to  sections 861 through 864 and the regulations thereunder; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> shall be treated as satisfied if it is reasonable to anticipate  that, with respect to the first taxable year thereafter for which such  corporation has gross income, such provisions will be satisfied.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Domestic parent corporation. The domestic parent corporation of  any domestic subsidiary is the domestic corporation which owns 80  percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of such domestic  subsidiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special rules--(1) Nondiscrimination requirements. For purposes  of applying sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b)(1)(B) (section 401(a)(3)(B),  as in effect on Septemeber 1, 1974, for plan years to which section 410  does not apply) and the regulation thereunder (relating to  nondiscrimination concerning benefits and contributions and coverage of  employees) with respect to an employee of the domestic subsidiary who is  treated as an employee of the domestic parent corporation under  paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the employee is an officer, shareholder, or (with respect to  plan years to which section 410 does not apply) a person whose principal  duties consist in supervising the work of other employees of the  domestic subsidiary of the domestic parent corporation, he shall be  treated as having such capacity with respect to the domestic parent  corporation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The determination as to whether the employee is a highly  compensated employee shall be made by comparing his total compensation  determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph with the  compensation of all the employees of the domestic parent corporation  (including individuals treated as employees of the domestic parent  corporation pursuant to section 407 and this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determination of compensation. For purposes of applying section  401(a) (5) and the regulations thereunder, relating to classifications  that will not be considered discriminatory, with respect to an employee  of the domestic subsidiary who is treated as an employee of the domestic  parent corporation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total compensation of the employee shall be the remuneration  of the   employee from the domestic subsidiary (including any allowances that are  paid to the employee because of his employment in a foreign country)  which would constitute his total compensation if his services had been  performed for such domestic parent corporation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The basic or regular rate of compensation of the employee shall  be determined for the employee in the same manner as it is determined  under section 401 for other employees of the domestic parent  corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Termination of status as deemed employee not to be treated as  separation from service for purposes of captial gain provisions and  limitation of tax. For purposes of applying the rules, relating to  treatment of certain distributions which are made after an employee's  separation from service, set forth in section 72(n) as in effect on  September 1, 1974 (with respect to taxable years ending after December  31, 1969, and to which section 402(e) does not apply), and in sections  402 (a)(2) and (e) and 403(a)(2) (with respect to distributions or  payments made after December 31, 1973, and in taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1973) with respect to an employee of a domestic  subsidiary who is treated as an employee of a domestic parent  corporation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the employee shall  not be considered as separated from the service of the domestic parent  corporation solely by reason of the occurrence of any one or more of the  following events:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fact that the corporation of which such individual is an  employee ceases, for any taxable year, to be a domestic subsidiary  within the mean of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee' ceasing to be an employee of the domestic  subsidiary of such domestic parent corporation, if he becomes an  employee of another corporation controlled by such domestic parent  corporation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The termination of the provision of the plan described in  paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, requiring coverage of the United  States citizens who are employees of domestic subsidiaries of the  domestic parent corporation.  For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, a corporation is  considered to be controlled by a domestic parent corporation if the  domestic parent corporation owns directly or indirectly more than 50  percent of the voting stock of the corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Deductibility of contributions--(1) In general. For purposes of  applying sections 404 and 405(c) with respect to the deduction for  contributions made to or under a pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus  plan described in section 401(a), and annuity plan described in section  403(a), or a bond purchase plan described in section 405(a), by a  domestic parent corporation, or by another corporation which is entitled  to deduct its contributions under section 404(a)(3)(B), on behalf of an  employee of a domestic subsidiary treated as an employee of the domestic  parent corporation under paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, no  deduction shall be allowed to the domestic parent corporation which  would otherwise be entitled to deduct its contributions on behalf of  such employee under one of such sections;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There shall be allowed as a deduction to the domestic  subsidiary of which such individual is an employee an amount equal to  the amount which (but for subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) would be  deductible under section 404 or section 405(c) by the domestic parent  corporation if the individual were an employee of the domestic parent  corporation and if his compensation were paid by the domestic  corporation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any reference to compensation shall be considered to be a  reference to the total compensation of such individual determined by  applying paragraph (c)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Year of deduction. Any amount deductible by the domestic  subsidiary under section 407(d) and this paragraph shall be deductible  for its taxable year with or within which ends the taxable year of the  domestic parent corporation for which the contribution was made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Special rules. Whether contributions to a plan on behalf of an  employee of the domestic subsidiary who is treated as an employee of the  domestic parent corporation under paragraph   (a)(1) of this section, or whether forfeitures with regard to such  employee, will require an inclusion in the income of the domestic parent  corporation or an adjustment in the basis of its stock in the domestic  subsidiary, shall be determined in accordance with the rules of general  application of subtitle A of chapter 1 of the Code (relating to income  taxes). For an example, and unreimbursed contribution by the domestic  parent corporation to a plan which meets the requirements of section  401(a) will be treated, to the extent each employee's rights to the  contribution are nonforfeitable, as a contribution of capital to the  domestic subsidiary to the extent that such contributions are made on  behalf of the employees of such subsidiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> (relating to special rules for computing employees'  contributions), section 101(b) (relating to employees' section 101(b)  (relating to employees' death benefits), section 2039 (relating to  annuities), and section 2517 (relating to certain annuities under  qualified plans) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Nonexempt trust. If the plan of the domestic parent corporation  is a qualified plan described under section 401(a), the fact that a  trust which forms a part of such plan is not exempt from tax under  section 501(a) shall not affect the treatment of an employee of a  domestic subsidiary as an employee of a domestic parent corporation  under section 407(a) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
