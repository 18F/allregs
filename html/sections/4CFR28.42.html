Opposition to a motion to compel must

be filed with the administrative judge within 10 days of the date of service of the motion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Discovery shall be completed by the time designated by the administrative judge, but no later than 65 days after the service of the notice of filing of a petition. A later date may be set by the administrative judge after due consideration of the particular situation including the dates set for hearing and closing of the case record.
