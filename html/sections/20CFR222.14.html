                            <p class="depth0">If a ceremonial or common-law marriage relationship cannot be  established under State law, a claimant may still be found to have the  relationship as spouse of an employee based upon a deemed marriage. A  claimant is deemed to be the wife, husband, or widow(er) of the employee  if the person's marriage to the employee would have been valid under  State law except for a legal impediment, and all of the following  requirements are met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The claimant married the employee in a civil or religious  ceremony.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The claimant went through the marriage ceremony in good faith.  Good faith means that at the time of the ceremony the claimant did not  know that a legal impediment existed, or if the claimant did know, he or  she thought that it would not prevent a valid marriage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The claimant was living in the same household as the employee  (see Sec. 222.16) when he or she applied for the spouse annuity or when  the employee died.
