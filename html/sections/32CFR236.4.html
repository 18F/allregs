                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Government and each DIB participant will execute a voluntary standardized agreement, referred to as a Framework Agreement (FA), to share, in a timely and secure manner, on a recurring basis, and to the greatest extent possible, cyber security information relating to information assurance for covered defense information on covered DIB systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each such FA between the Government and a DIB participant must comply with and implement the requirements of this part, and will include additional terms and conditions as necessary to effectively implement the voluntary information sharing activities described in this part with individual DIB participants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> DoD's DIB CS/IA Program Office is the overall point of contact for the program. The DoD Cyber Crime Center's DoD-DIB Collaborative Information Sharing Environment (DC3/DCISE) is the operational focal point for cyber threat information sharing and incident reporting under the DIB CS/IA program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Government will maintain a Web site or other Internet-based capability to provide potential DIB participants with information about eligibility and participation in the program, to enable the online application or registration for participation, and to support the execution of necessary agreements with the Government. http://dibnet.dod.mil/.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prior to receiving GFI from the Government, each DIB participant shall provide the requisite points of contact information, to include security clearance and citizenship information, for the designated personnel within their company (e.g., typically 3-10 company designated points of contact) in order to facilitate the DoD-DIB interaction in the DIB CS/IA program. The Government will confirm the accuracy of the information provided as a condition of that point of contact being authorized to act on behalf of the DIB participant for this program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> GFI will be issued via both unclassified and classified means. DIB participant handling and safeguarding of classified information shall be in compliance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (DoD 5220.22-M). The Government shall specify transmission and distribution procedures for all GFI, and shall inform DIB participants of any

revisions to previously specified transmission or procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Except as authorized in this part or in writing by the Government, DIB participants may use GFI to safeguard covered defense information only on covered DIB systems that are U.S. based; and share GFI only within their company or organization, on a need to know basis, with distribution restricted to U.S. citizens. However, in individual cases, upon request of a DIB participant that has determined that it requires the ability to share the information with a non U.S. citizen, or to use the GFI on a non-U.S. based covered DIB system, and can demonstrate that appropriate information handling and protection mechanisms are in place, the Government may authorize such disclosure or use under appropriate terms and conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> DIB participants shall maintain the capability to electronically disseminate GFI within the Company in an encrypted fashion (e.g., using Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), secure socket layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2, DoD-approved medium assurance certificates).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The DIB participants shall not share GFI outside of their company or organization, regardless of personnel clearance level, except as authorized in this part or otherwise authorized in writing by the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If the DIB participant utilizes a third-party service provider (SP) for information system security services, the DIB participant may share GFI with that SP under the following conditions and as authorized in writing by the Government:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The DIB participant must identify the SP to the Government and request permission to share or disclose any GFI with that SP (which may include a request that the Government share information directly with the SP on behalf of the DIB participant) solely for the authorized purposes of this program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The SP must provide the Government with sufficient information to enable the Government to determine whether the SP is eligible to receive such information, and possesses the capability to provide appropriate protections for the GFI;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon approval by the Government, the SP must enter into a legally binding agreement with the DIB participant (and also an appropriate agreement with the Government in any case in which the SP will receive or share information directly with the Government on behalf of the DIB participant) under which the SP is subject to all applicable requirements of this part and of any supplemental terms and conditions in the DIB participant's FA with the Government, and which authorizes the SP to use the GFI only as authorized by the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The DIB participant may not sell, lease, license, or otherwise incorporate the GFI into its products or services, except that this does not prohibit a DIB participant from being appropriately designated an SP in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section.</p>
