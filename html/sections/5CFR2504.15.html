                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individuals who disagree with the refusal of the Office to grant them access to or to amend a record about them should submit a written request for review to the Privacy Act Officer, Office of Administration, Washington, DC 20503. The words ``PRIVACY ACT--APPEAL'' should be written on the letter and the envelope. Individuals desiring assistance preparing their appeal should contact the Privacy Act Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The appeal letter must be received by the Office within 30 calendar days from the date the requestor received the notice of denial. At a minimum, the appeal letter should identify:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The records involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date of the initial request for access to or amendment of the record;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date of the Office denial of that request; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The reasons supporting the request for reversal of the Office's decision.
Copies of previous correspondence from the Office denying the request to access or amend the record should also be attached, if possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Office reserves the right to dispose of correspondence concerning the request to access or amend a record if no request for review of the Office's decision is received within 180 days of the decision date. Therefore, a request for review received after 180 days may, at the discretion of the Privacy Act Officer, be treated as an initial request to access or amend a record.
