                            <p class="depth0">Ethylene/1,3-phenylene oxyethylene isophthalate/terephthalate copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 87365-98-8) identified in paragraph (a) of this section may be safely used, subject to the provisions of this section, as the non-food-contact layer of laminate structures subject to the provisions of Sec.  177.1395, and in blends with polyethylene terephthalate polymers complying with Sec.  177.1630.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identity. For the purpose of this section, ethylene/1,3-phenylene oxyethylene isophthalate/terephthalate copolymer consists of the basic copolymer produced by the catalytic polycondensation of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid with ethylene glycol and 1,3-bis(2-hydroxyethoxy)benzene such that the finished resin contains between 42 and 48 mole-percent of isophthalic moieties, between 2 and 8 mole-percent of terephthalic moieties, and not more than 10 mole-percent of 1,3-bis(2-hydroxyethoxy)benzene moieties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specifications--(1) Density. Ethylene/1,3-phenylene oxyethylene isophthalate/terephthalate copolymer

identified in paragraph (a) of this section has a density of 1.330.02 grams per cubic centimeter measured by ASTM Method D 1505-85 (Reapproved 1990), ``Standard Test Method for Density of Plastics by the Density-Gradient Technique,'' which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
