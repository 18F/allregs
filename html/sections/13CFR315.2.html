Imports will not be considered to have Contributed Importantly if other factors were so dominant, acting singly or in combination, that the worker separation or threat thereof or decline in sales or production would have been essentially the same, irrespective of the influence of imports.</p><p class="depth0">Decreased Absolutely means a Firm's sales or production has declined by a minimum of five percent relative to its sales or production during the applicable prior time period,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Independent of industry or market fluctuations; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Relative only to the previous performance of the Firm, unless EDA determines that these limitations in a given case would not be consistent with the purposes of the Trade Act.</p><p class="depth0">Directly Competitive means imported articles or services that compete with and are substantially equivalent for commercial purposes (i.e., are adapted for the same function or use and are essentially interchangeable) as the Firm's articles or services.

Pursuant to section 261 of chapter 3 of title II of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2351), a Firm, together with any predecessor or successor firm, or any affiliated firm controlled or substantially beneficially owned by substantially the same person, may be considered a single Firm where necessary to prevent unjustifiable benefits. For purposes of receiving benefits under this part, when a Firm owns or controls other Firms, the Firm and such other Firms may be considered a single Firm when they produce or supply like or Directly Competitive articles or services or are exerting essential economic control over one or more production facilities. Accordingly, such other Firms may include a(n):</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Predecessor--see the following definition for Successor;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Successor--a newly established Firm (that has been in business less than two years) which has purchased substantially all of the assets of a previously operating company (or in some cases a whole distinct division) (such prior company, unit or division, a `Predecessor') and is able to demonstrate that it continued the operations of the Predecessor which has operated as an autonomous unit, provided that there were no significant transactions between the Predecessor unit and any related parent, subsidiary, or affiliate that would have affected its past performance, and that separate records are available for the Predecessor's operations for at least two years before the petition is submitted. The Successor Firm must have continued virtually all of the Predecessor Firm's operations by producing the same type of products or services, in the same plant, utilizing most of the same machinery and equipment and most of its former workers, and the Predecessor Firm must no longer be in existence;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Affiliate--a company (either foreign or domestic) controlled or substantially beneficially owned by substantially the same person or persons

that own or control the Firm filing the petition; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Subsidiary--a company (either foreign or domestic) that is wholly owned or effectively controlled by another company.</p><p class="depth0">Increase in Imports means an increase of imports of Directly Competitive or Like Articles or Services with articles produced or services supplied by such Firm. EDA may consider as evidence of an Increase in Imports a certification from the Firm's customers that account for a significant percentage of the Firm's decrease in sales or production that they have increased their purchase of imports of Directly Competitive or Like Articles or Services from a foreign country, either absolutely or relative to their acquisition of such Like Articles or Services from suppliers located in the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Like Articles or Services means any articles or services, as applicable, which are substantially identical in their intrinsic characteristics.</p><p class="depth0">Partial Separation means, with respect to any employment in a Firm, either:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> A reduction in an employee's work hours to 80 percent or less of the employee's average weekly hours during the year of such reductions as compared to the preceding year; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A reduction in the employee's weekly wage to 80 percent or less of his/her average weekly wage during the year of such reduction as compared to the preceding year.</p><p class="depth0">Person means an individual, organization or group.</p><p class="depth0">Record means any of the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> A petition for certification of eligibility to qualify for Adjustment Assistance;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Any supporting information submitted by a petitioner;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The report of an EDA investigation with respect to petition; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Any information developed during an investigation or in connection with any public hearing held on a petition.</p><p class="depth2">Service Sector Firm means a Firm engaged in the business of supplying services. For purposes of receiving benefits under this part, when a Service Sector Firm owns or controls other Service Sector Firms, the Service Sector Firm and such other Service Sector Firms may be considered a single Service Sector Firm when they furnish like or Directly Competitive services or are exerting essential economic control over one or more servicing facilities. Such other Service Sector Firm may be a Predecessor, Successor, Affiliate or Subsidiary, each as defined in the definition of Firm.</p><p class="depth2">Significant Number or Proportion of Workers means five percent of a Firm's work force or 50 workers, whichever is less, unless EDA determines that these limitations in a given case would not be consistent with the purposes of the Trade Act. An individual farmer or fisherman is considered a Significant Number or Proportion of Workers.</p><p class="depth2">Substantial Interest means a direct material economic interest in the certification or non-certification of the petitioner.</p><p class="depth2">TAAC means a Trade Adjustment Assistance Center, as more fully described in Sec. 315.5.</p><p class="depth2">Threat of Total or Partial Separation means, with respect to any group of workers, one or more events or circumstances clearly demonstrating that a Total or Partial Separation is imminent.</p><p class="depth2">Total Separation means, with respect to any employment in a Firm, the laying off or termination of employment of an employee for lack of work.</p>
