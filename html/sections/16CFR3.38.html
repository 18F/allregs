                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Motion for order to compel. A party may apply by motion to the  Administrative Law Judge for an order compelling disclosure or  discovery, including a determination of the sufficiency of the answers  or objections with respect to the mandatory initial disclosures required  by Sec. 3.31(b), a request for admission under Sec. 3.32, a deposition  under Sec. 3.33, an interrogatory under Sec. 3.35, or a production of  documents or things or access for inspection or other purposes under  Sec. 3.37. Any memorandum in support of such motion shall be no longer  than 2,500 words. Any response to the motion by the opposing party must  be filed within 5 days of receipt of service of the motion and shall be  no longer than 2,500 words. These word count limitations include  headings, footnotes, and quotations, but do not include the cover, table  of contents, table of citations or authorities, glossaries, statements  with respect to oral argument, any addendums containing statutes, rules  or regulations, any certificates of counsel, proposed form of order, and   any attachment required by Sec. 3.45(e). The Administrative Law Judge  shall rule on a motion to compel within 3 business days of the date in  which the response is due. Unless the Administrative Law Judge  determines that the objection is justified, the Administrative Law Judge  shall order that an initial disclosure or an answer to any requests for  admissions, documents, depositions, or interrogatories be served or  disclosure otherwise be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If a party or an officer or agent of a party fails to comply  with any discovery obligation imposed by these rules, upon motion by the  aggrieved party, the Administrative Law Judge or the Commission, or  both, may take such action in regard thereto as is just, including but  not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Order that any answer be amended to comply with the request,  subpoena, or order;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Order that the matter be admitted or that the admission,  testimony, documents, or other evidence would have been adverse to the  party;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rule that for the purposes of the proceeding the matter or  matters concerning which the order or subpoena was issued be taken as  established adversely to the party;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rule that the party may not introduce into evidence or otherwise  rely, in support of any claim or defense, upon testimony by such party,  officer, agent, expert, or fact witness, or the documents or other  evidence, or upon any other improperly withheld or undisclosed  materials, information, witnesses, or other discovery;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Rule that the party may not be heard to object to introduction  and use of secondary evidence to show what the withheld admission,  testimony, documents, or other evidence would have shown;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Rule that a pleading, or part of a pleading, or a motion or  other submission by the party, concerning which the order or subpoena  was issued, be stricken, or that a decision of the proceeding be  rendered against the party, or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Any such action may be taken by written or oral order issued in  the course of the proceeding or by inclusion in an initial decision of  the Administrative Law Judge or an order or opinion of the Commission.  It shall be the duty of parties to seek and Administrative Law Judges to  grant such of the foregoing means of relief or other appropriate relief  as may be sufficient to compensate for withheld testimony, documents, or  other evidence. If in the Administrative Law Judge's opinion such relief  would not be sufficient, or in instances where a nonparty fails to  comply with a subpoena or order, he or she shall certify to the  Commission a request that court enforcement of the subpoena or order be  sought.  [74 FR 1829, Jan. 13, 2009]    Sec. 3.38A  Withholding requested material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any person withholding material responsive to a subpoena issued  pursuant to Sec. 3.34 or Sec. 3.36, written interrogatories requested  pursuant to Sec. 3.35, a request for production or access pursuant to  Sec. 3.37, or any other request for the production of materials under  this part, shall assert a claim of privilege or any similar claim not  later than the date set for production of the material. Such person  shall, if so directed in the subpoena or other request for production,  submit, together with such claim, a schedule which describes the nature  of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or  disclosed - and does so in a manner that, without revealing information  itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the  claim. The schedule need not describe any material outside the scope of  the duty to search set forth in Sec. 3.31(c)(2) except to the extent  that the Administrative Law Judge has authorized additional discovery as  provided in that paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A person withholding material for reasons described in Sec.  3.38A(a) shall comply with the requirements of that subsection in lieu  of filing a motion to limit or quash compulsory process.</p><p class="depth0">(Sec. 5 of theFTC Act (15 U.S.C. 45))  [74 FR 1830, Jan. 13, 2009]</p>
