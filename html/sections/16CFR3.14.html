                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any individual, partnership, unincorporated association, or  corporation desiring to intervene in an adjudicative proceeding shall  make written application in the form of a motion setting forth the basis  therefor. Such application shall have attached to it a certificate  showing service thereof upon each party to the proceeding in accordance   with the provisions of Sec. 4.4(b) of this chapter. A similar  certificate shall be attached to the answer filed by any party, other  than counsel in support of the complaint, showing service of such answer  upon the applicant. The Administrative Law Judge or the Commission may  by order permit the intervention to such extent and upon such terms as  are provided by law or as otherwise may be deemed proper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In an adjudicative proceeding where the complaint states that  divestiture relief is contemplated, the labor organization[s]  representing employees of the respondent[s] may intervene as a matter of  right. Applications for such intervention are to be made in accordance  with the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and must  be filed within 60 days of the issuance of the complaint. Intervention  as a matter of right shall be limited to the issue of the effect, if  any, of proposed remedies on employment, with full rights of  participation in the proceeding concerning this issue. This paragraph  does not affect a labor organization's ability to petition for leave to  intervene pursuant to Sec. 3.14(a).  [32 FR 8449, June 13, 1967, as amended at 46 FR 20979, Apr. 8, 1981]</p>
