You must also develop a site-specific  test plan according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must conduct each stack test according to the requirements  in Table 4 to this subpart. Boilers that use a CEMS for carbon monoxide  (CO) are exempt from the initial CO performance testing in Table 4 to  this subpart and the oxygen concentration operating limit requirement  specified in Table 3 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must conduct performance stack tests at the representative  operating load conditions while burning the type of fuel or mixture of  fuels that have the highest emissions potential for each regulated  pollutant, and you must demonstrate initial compliance and establish  your operating limits based on these performance stack tests. For  subcategories with more than one emission limit, these requirements  could result in the need to conduct more than one performance stack  test. Following each performance stack test and until the next  performance stack test, you must comply with the operating limit for  operating load conditions specified in Table 3 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must conduct a minimum of three separate test runs for each  performance stack test required in this section, as specified in  Sec. 63.7(e)(3) and in accordance with the provisions in Table 4 to this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To determine compliance with the emission limits, you must use  the F-Factor methodology and equations in sections 12.2 and 12.3 of EPA  Method 19 of appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter to convert the  measured PM concentrations and the measured mercury concentrations that  result from the performance test to pounds per million Btu heat input  emission rates.
