For each assisted unit that is not leased as of the effective date of the Contract, the owner is entitled to vacancy payments in the amount of 80 percent of the contract rent for the first 60 days of vacancy if the owner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conducted marketing in accordance with Sec. 880.601(a) and otherwise complied with Sec. 880.601;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has not rejected any eligible applicant except for good cause acceptable to the contract administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vacancies after Rent-Up. If an eligible family vacates a unit, the owner is entitled to vacancy payments in the amount of 80 percent of the contract rent for the first 60 days of vacancy if the owner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certifies that he did not cause the vacancy by violating the lease, the Contract or any applicable law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notified the contract administrator of the vacancy or prospective

vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy immediately upon learning of the vacancy or prospective vacancy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has fulfilled and continues to fulfill the requirements specified in Sec. 880.601(a) (2) and (3) and paragraph (b) (2) and (3) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For any vacancy resulting from the owner's eviction of an eligible family, certifies that he has complied with Sec. 880.607.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Vacancies for longer than 60 days. If an assisted unit continues to be vacant after the 60-day period specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the owner may apply to receive additional vacancy payments in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments required to amortize that portion of the debt service attributable to the vacant unit for up to 12 additional months for the unit if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The unit was in decent, safe and sanitary condition during the vacancy period for which payments are claimed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner has fulfilled and continues to fulfill the requirements specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as appropriate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner has (for 24 CFR part 883 projects, the owner and the Agency have) demonstrated to the satisfaction of HUD that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the period of vacancy, the project is not providing the owner with revenues at least equal to project expenses (exclusive of depreciation), and the amount of payments requested is not more than the portion of the deficiency attributable to the vacant unit, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prohibition of double compensation for vacancies. The owner is not entitled to vacancy payments for vacant units to the extent he can collect for the vacancy from other sources (such as security deposits, payments under Sec. 880.608(f), and governmental payments under other programs).
