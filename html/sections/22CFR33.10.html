                            <p class="depth0">The Office Director, Office of Marine Conservation, Bureau of Oceans  and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, will pay the  claimant the amount calculated under Sec. 33.9. Payment will be made as  promptly as practicable, but may be delayed pending the appropriation of  sufficient funds, should fee collections not be adequate to sustain the  operation of the Fund. The Director shall notify the claimant of the  amount approved for payment as promptly as practicable and the same  shall thereafter constitute a valid, but non-interest bearing obligation  of the Government. Delays in payments are not a direct consequence of  seizure and detention and cannot therefore be construed as increasing  the compensable period for lost fishing time. If there is a question  about distribution of the proceeds of the claim, the Director may  request proof of interest from all parties, and will settle this issue.</p>
