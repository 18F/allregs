                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued  under Sec. 101-6.213-6 shall be restored to full eligibility to receive  Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of  that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance  with this subpart and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully  comply with this subpart. An elementary or secondary school or school  system which is unable to file an assurance of compliance with Sec.  101-6.24 shall be restored to full eligibility to receive financial  assistance if it files a court order or a plan for desegregation meeting  the requirements of Sec. 101-6.205-3 and provides reasonable assurance  that it will comply with this court order or plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order  entered pursuant to Sec. 101-6.213-6 may at any time request the  responsible GSA official to restore fully its eligibility to receive  Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by  information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. If the responsible GSA  official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he  shall restore such eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the responsible GSA official denies any such request, the  applicant or recipient may submit a request, in writing, for a hearing,  specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall  thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the  record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible  GSA official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such  eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. While proceedings under  this section are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued  under Sec. 101-6.213-6 shall remain in effect.  [38 FR 17975, July 5, 1973]</p>
