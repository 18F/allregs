                            <p class="depth0">Advance Planning Document (APD) refers to an Initial advance automated data processing planning document or Initial APD, providing a recorded plan of action to request funding approval for a project which will require the use of ADP services or equipment, including the use of shared or purchased services in lieu of State acquired stand-alone resources. Requirements are detailed in paragraph (a), (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Planning APD. (1) A separate planning effort and Planning APD is optional, but highly recommended, and generally applies to large statewide system developments and/or major hardware acquisitions. States with large, independent counties requesting funding at the regular match rate for county systems are strongly encouraged to engage in planning activities commensurate with the complexity of the projected ADP project and to submit a Planning APD to allow for time and to provide funding for its planning activities. Therefore, States must consider the scope and complexity of a project to determine whether to submit a Planning APD as a separate document to HHS or whether to combine the two phases of planning and implementation into one APD covering both the Planning APD and the Implementation APD requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A separate planning effort and Planning APD is optional, but highly recommended, and generally applies to large statewide system developments and/or major hardware acquisitions.

cost allocation/distribution, including planning and implementation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A commitment to conduct/prepare the problem(s) needs assessment, feasibility study, alternatives analysis, cost benefit analysis, and to develop a Functional Requirements Specification and/or a General Systems Design (GSD);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A commitment to define the State's functional requirements, based on the State's business needs which may be used for the purpose of evaluating the transfer of an existing system, including the transfer of another State's General System Design that the State may adapt to meet State specific requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Additional Planning APD content requirements, for enhanced funding projects as contained in Sec. 307.15 and Sec. Sec. 1355.50 through 1355.57; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> An acquisition summary for the upcoming year or development phase that provides the following information on proposed acquisitions:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Type and scope of contract</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Procurement strategy</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Estimated cost or not to exceed amount</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Timeframe of contract</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> A statement or certification that the proposed acquisition will comply with all State and Federal requirements including the retention of software ownership rights specified in Sec. 95.617.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Implementation APD.

The As-Needed APDU may be submitted any time as a stand-alone funding or project continuation request, or may be submitted as part of the Annual APDU. The As-Needed APDU is submitted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the State anticipates incremental project expenditures (exceeding specified thresholds);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the State anticipates a schedule extension of more than 60 days for major milestones;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When the State anticipates major changes in the scope of its project, e.g., a change in its procurement plan, procurement activities, system concept or development approach;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> When the State anticipates significant changes to its cost distribution methodology or distribution of costs among Federal programs; and/or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> When the State anticipates significant changes to its cost benefit projections.
