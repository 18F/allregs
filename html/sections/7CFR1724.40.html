                            <p class="depth0">Borrowers shall have ongoing, integrated planning to determine their short-term and long-term needs for plant additions, improvements, replacements, and retirements for their electric systems. The primary components of the planning system consist of long-range engineering plans and construction work plans. Long-range engineering plans identify plant investments required over a long-range period, 10 years or more. Construction work plans specify and document plant requirements for a shorter term, 2 to 4 years. Long-range engineering plans and construction work plans shall be in accordance with part 1710, subpart F, of this chapter. See also RUS Bulletins 1724D-101A, Electric System Long-Range Planning Guide, and 1724D-101B, System Planning Guide, Construction Work Plans, for additional guidance.
