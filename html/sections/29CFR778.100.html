                            <p class="depth0">Section 7(a) of the Act deals with maximum hours and overtime  compensation for employees who are within the general coverage of the  Act and are not specifically exempt from its overtime pay requirements.  It prescribes the maximum weekly hours of work permitted for the  employment of such employees in any workweek without extra compensation  for overtime,   and a general overtime rate of pay not less than one and one-half times  the employee's regular rate which the employee must receive for all  hours worked in any workweek in excess of the applicable maximum hours.  The employment by an employer of an employee in any work subject to the  Act in any workweek brings these provisions into operation. The employer  is prohibited from employing the employee in excess of the prescribed  maximum hours in such workweek without paying him the required extra  compensation for the overtime hours worked at a rate meeting the  statutory requirement.</p>
