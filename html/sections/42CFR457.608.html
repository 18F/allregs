The additional amount for allotment for FY 1999 for the Commonwealths and Territories was provided under Public Law 105-277.

The first step determines the preadjusted proportions, and is described under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The first step applies in determining the proportion for all fiscal years. The second step applies floors and ceilings and, if necessary, applies a reconciliation to the preadjusted proportion. The second step is described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The second step applies in determining the proportion only for FY 2000 and subsequent fiscal years. For FY 1998 and FY 1999, the preadjusted proportion is the State or District of Columbia's proportion for the fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of the Preadjusted Proportions for a Fiscal Year. (i)The methodology for determining the State preadjusted proportion, referring to the determination of the proportion before the application of floors and ceilings and reconciliation for a fiscal year is in accordance with the following formula:
PPi = (Ci x SCFi)/ [Sigma](Ci x x SCFi)
PPi = Preadjusted proportion for a State or District of</p><p class="depth0">Columbia for a fiscal year.Ci = Number of children in a State (section 2104(b)(1)(A)(I)</p><p class="depth0">of the Act) for a fiscal year. This number is based on the</p><p class="depth0">number of low-income children for a State for a fiscal year</p><p class="depth0">and the number of low-income children for a State for a fiscal</p><p class="depth0">year with no health insurance coverage for the fiscal year</p><p class="depth0">determined on the basis of the arithmetic average of the</p><p class="depth0">number of such children as reported and defined in the 3 most</p><p class="depth0">recent March supplements to the Current Population Survey</p><p class="depth0"><em>(CPS)</em> of the Bureau of the Census, and for FY 2000 and</p><p class="depth0">subsequent fiscal years, officially available before the</p><p class="depth0">beginning of the calendar year in which the fiscal year</p><p class="depth0">begins. For FY 1998 and FY 1999, the availability of the CPS</p><p class="depth0">data obtained from the Bureau of the Census is as specified in</p><p class="depth0">paragraphs (e)(4) and (5) of this section, respectively.</p><p class="depth0">(section 2104(b)(2)(B) of the Act).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each of the fiscal years 1998 and 1999, the number of children is equal to the number of low-income children in the State for the fiscal year with no health insurance coverage. For fiscal year 2000, the number of children is equal to the sum of 75 percent of the number of low-income children in the

State for the fiscal year with no health insurance coverage and 25 percent of the number of low-income children in the State for the fiscal year. For fiscal years 2001 and thereafter, the number of children is equal to the sum of 50 percent of the number of low-income children in the State for the fiscal year with no health insurance coverage and 50 percent of the number of low-income children in the State for the fiscal year. (section 2104(b)(2)(A) of the Act).
SCFi = State cost factor for a State (section 2104(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act). For a fiscal year, this is equal to: .15 + .85 x (Wi/WN) (section 2104(b)(3)(A) of the Act).
Wi = The annual average wages per employee for a State for</p><p class="depth0">such year (section 2104(b)(3)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act).WN = The annual average wages per employee for the 50 States</p><p class="depth0">and the District of Columbia (section 2104(b)(3)(A)(ii)(II) of</p><p class="depth0">the Act). The annual average wages per employee for a State or</p><p class="depth0">for all States and the District of Columbia for a fiscal year</p><p class="depth0">is equal to the average of such wages for employees in the</p><p class="depth0">health services industry (SIC 80), as reported by the Bureau</p><p class="depth0">of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor for each of the</p><p class="depth0">most recent 3 years, and for FY 2000 and subsequent fiscal</p><p class="depth0">years, finally available before the beginning of the calendar</p><p class="depth0">year in which the fiscal year begins. For FY 1998 and FY 1999,</p><p class="depth0">the availability of the wage data obtained from the Bureau of</p><p class="depth0">Labor Statistics is as specified in paragraphs (e)(4) and (5),</p><p class="depth0">respectively.

The preadjusted State proportions for a fiscal year are subject to the application of floors and ceilings in paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The proportion floors, or minimum proportions, that apply in determining a State's proportion for the fiscal year are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> $2,000,000 divided by the total of the amount available nationally;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 90 percent of the State's proportion for the previous fiscal year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> 70 percent of the State's proportion for FY 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The proportion ceiling, or maximum proportion, for a fiscal year that applies in determining the State's fiscal year proportion is 145 percent of the State's proportion for FY 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reconciliation of State proportions. If, after the application of the floors and ceilings in paragraph (e)(3)(i), the sum of the States' proportions is not equal to one, the Secretary will reconcile the States' proportions by applying either paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) or (B) of this paragraph, as appropriate, such that the sum of the proportions after reconciliation equals one. If, after the application of the floors and ceilings in paragraph (e)(3)(i), the sum of the States' proportions is equal to one, no reconciliation is necessary, and the States' proportions will be the same as the preadjusted proportions determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If, after the application of the floors and ceilings under paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, the sum of the States' proportions is greater than one, the Secretary will establish a maximum percentage increase in States' proportions, such that when applied to the States' proportions, the sum of the proportions is exactly equal to one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If, after the application of the floors and ceilings under paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(A) and (B), the sum of the proportions is less than one, the Secretary will increase States' proportions (as computed before the application of the floors under paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A)) in a pro rata manner (but not to exceed the 145 percent ceiling computed under paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B)), such that when applied to the States' proportions, the sum of the proportions is exactly equal to one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Data used for calculating the FY 1998 CHIP allotments. The FY 1998 CHIP allotments were calculated in accordance with the methodology described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, using the most recent official and final data that were available from the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, respectively, prior to the September 1 before the beginning

of FY 1998 (that is, through August 31, 1997). In particular, through August 31, 1997, the only official data available on the numbers of children were data from the 3 March CPSs conducted in March 1994, 1995, and 1996 that reflected data for the 3 calendar years 1993, 1994, and 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Data used for calculating the FY 1999 CHIP allotments. In accordance with section 101(f) of Public Law 105-277, the FY 1999 allotments were calculated in accordance with the methodology described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, using the same data as were used in calculating the FY 1998 CHIP allotments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Methodology for determining the Commonwealth and Territory allotments for a fiscal year. The total amount available for the Commonwealths and Territories for each fiscal year, as determined under paragraph (d) of this section, is allotted to each Territory and Commonwealth below which has an approved State child health plan.
