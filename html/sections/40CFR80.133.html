                            <p class="depth0">The following are the minimum attest procedures that shall be carried out for each refinery and importer. Agreed upon procedures may vary from the procedures stated in this section due to the nature of the refiner's or importer's business or records, provided

that any refiner or importer desiring to use modified procedures obtains prior approval from EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> EPA reports. (1) Obtain and read a copy of the refinery's or importer's reports (except for batch reports) filed with the EPA as required by Sec.

Foot and crossfoot the refinery-specific totals and agree to the values in the aggregate report. The procedures in paragraphs (b) through (m) of this section then are performed separately for each refinery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Obtain a written representation from a company representative that the report copies are complete and accurate copies of the reports filed with the EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Identify, and report as a finding, the name of the commercial computer program used by the refiner or importer to track the data required by the regulations in this part, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inventory reconciliation analysis.

If the analysis shows no production of conventional gasoline or if the refinery or importer represents under paragraph (l) of this section that it has a baseline less stringent or equal to the statutory baseline, the analysis may exclude non-finished-gasoline petroleum products.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Report as a finding the volume totals for each product type.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Listing of tenders. For each product type other than non-finished gasoline petroleum products (i.e., reformulated gasoline, RBOB, conventional gasoline), obtain a separate listing of all tenders from the refinery or importer for the reporting period. Each listing should provide for each tender the volume shipped and other information as needed to distinguish tenders. Perform the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Foot to the volume totals per the listings; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each product type listed in the inventory reconciliation analysis obtained in paragraph (b) of this section, agree the volume total on the listing to the tender volume total in the inventory reconciliation analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Listing of batches. For each product type other than non-finished gasoline petroleum products (i.e., reformulated gasoline, RBOB, and conventional gasoline), obtain separate listings of all batches reported to the EPA and perform the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Foot to the volume totals per the listings; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agree the total volumes in the listings to the production volume in the inventory reconciliation analysis obtained in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reformulated gasoline tenders.
