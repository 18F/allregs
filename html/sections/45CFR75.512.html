                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The audit must be completed and the data collection  form described in paragraph (b) of this section and reporting package  described in paragraph (c) of this section must be submitted within the  earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or  nine months after the end of the audit period. If the due date falls on  a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the reporting package is due the  next business day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless restricted by Federal statutes or regulations, the  auditee must make copies available for public inspection. Auditees and  auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting  package do not include protected personally identifiable information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Data collection. The FAC is the repository of record for subpart  F of this part reporting packages and the data collection form. All  Federal agencies, pass-through entities and others interested in a  reporting package and data collection form must obtain it by accessing  the FAC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The auditee must submit required data elements described in  appendix X to part 75, which state whether the audit was completed in  accordance with this part and provides information about the auditee,  its Federal programs, and the results of the audit. The data must  include information available from the audit required by this part that  is necessary for Federal agencies to use the audit to ensure integrity  for Federal programs. The data elements and format must be approved by  OMB, available from the FAC, and include collections of information from  the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section. A  senior level representative of the auditee (e.g., state controller,  director of finance, chief executive officer, or chief financial  officer) must sign a statement to be included as part of the data  collection that says that the auditee complied with the requirements of  this part, the data were prepared in accordance with this part (and the  instructions accompanying the form), the reporting package does not  include protected personally identifiable information, the information  included in its entirety is accurate and complete, and that the FAC is  authorized to make the reporting package and the form publicly available  on a Web site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception for Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations. An auditee  that is an Indian tribe or a tribal organization (as defined in the  Indian Self-Determination, Education and Assistance Act (ISDEAA), 25  U.S.C. 450b(l)) may opt not to authorize the FAC to make the reporting  package publicly available on a Web site, by excluding the authorization  for the FAC publication in the statement described in paragraph (b)(1)  of this section. If this option is exercised, the auditee becomes  responsible for submitting the reporting package directly to any pass- through entities through which it has received a Federal award and to  pass-through entities for which the summary schedule of prior audit  findings reported the status of any findings related to Federal awards  that the pass-through entity provided. Unless restricted by Federal  statute or regulation, if the auditee opts not to authorize publication,  it must make copies of the reporting package available for public  inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Using the information included in the reporting package  described in paragraph (c) of this section, the auditor must complete  the applicable data elements of the data collection form. The auditor  must sign a statement to be included as part of the data collection form  that indicates, at a minimum, the source of the information included in  the form, the auditor's responsibility for the information, that the  form is not a substitute for the reporting package described in  paragraph (c) of this section, and that the content of the form is  limited to the collection of information prescribed by OMB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reporting package. The reporting package must include the:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal  awards discussed in Sec. 75.510(a) and (b), respectively;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Summary schedule of prior audit findings discussed in Sec.  75.511(b);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Auditor's report(s) discussed in Sec. 75.515; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Corrective action plan discussed in Sec. 75.511(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Submission to FAC. The auditee must electronically submit to the  FAC the data collection form described in paragraph (b) of this section  and the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Requests for management letters issued by the auditor. In  response to requests by a Federal agency or pass-through entity,  auditees must submit a copy of any management letters issued by the  auditor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Report retention requirements. Auditees must keep one copy of  the data collection form described in paragraph (b) of this section and  one copy of the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this  section on file for three years from the date of submission to the FAC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> FAC responsibilities. The FAC must make available the reporting  packages received in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and  Sec. 75.507(c) to the public, except for Indian tribes exercising the  option in (b)(2) of this section, and maintain a data base of completed  audits, provide appropriate information to Federal agencies, and follow  up with known auditees that have not submitted the required data  collection forms and reporting packages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Electronic filing. Nothing in this part must preclude electronic  submissions to the FAC in such manner as may be approved by OMB.</p><p class="depth2">Federal Agencies</p>
