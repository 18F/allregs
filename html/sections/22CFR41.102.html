Except when the requirement of personal appearance has been waived pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, each applicant for a nonimmigrant visa must personally appear before and be interviewed by a consular officer, who shall determine on the basis of the applicant's representations, the visa application and other relevant documentation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proper nonimmigrant classification, if any, of the alien; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The alien's eligibility to receive a visa.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waivers of personal appearance by consular officers. Except as provided in

Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services may waive the personal appearance before a consular officer of an individual applicant or a class of applicants if the Deputy Assistant Secretary finds that the waiver of personal appearance is warranted in the national interest or because of unusual circumstances and that national security concerns do not require an interview.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cases in which personal appearance may not be waived. A consular officer or the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State may not waive personal appearance for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any NIV applicant who is not a national or resident of the country in which he or she is applying, unless the applicant is eligible for a waiver of the interview under paragraphs (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any NIV applicant who was previously refused a visa, is listed in CLASS, or who otherwise requires a Security Advisory Opinion, unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The visa was refused temporarily and the refusal was subsequently overcome;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The alien was found inadmissible, but the inadmissibility was waived; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The applicant is eligible for a waiver of the interview under paragraphs (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any NIV applicant who is from a country designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism, regardless of age, or in a group designated by the Secretary of State under section 222(h)(2)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, unless the applicant is eligible for a waiver under paragraphs (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unusual circumstances.
