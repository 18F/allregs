A belt shifter lock is a device for  positively locking the belt shifter in position while the machine is  stopped and the belt is idling on the loose pulleys.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Calender. A calender in essence consists of a set of heavy  rollers mounted on vertical side frames and arranged to pass cloth  between them. Calenders may have two to ten rollers, or bowls, some of  which can be heated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Embossing calender. An embossing calender is a calender with two  or more rolls, one of which is engraved for producing figured effects of  various kinds on a fabric.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Cans (drying). Drying cans are hollow cylindrical drums mounted  in a frame so they can rotate. They are heated with steam and are used  to dry fabrics or yarn as it passes around the perimeter of the can.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Carbonizing. Carbonizing means the removing of vegetable matter  such as burns, straws, etc., from wool by treatment with acid, followed  by heat. The undesired matter is reduced to a carbon-like form which may  be removed by dusting or shaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Card. A card machine consists of cylinders of various sizes-and  in certain cases flats-covered with card clothing and set in relation to  each other so that fibers in staple form may be separated into  individual relationship. The speed of the cylinders and their direction  of rotation varies. The finished product is delivered as a sliver. Cards  of different types are: The revolving flat card, the roller-and-clearer  card, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Card clothing. Card clothing is the material with which many of  the surfaces of a card are covered; e.g., the cylinder, doffer, etc. It  consists of a thick foundation material, usually made of textile  fabrics, through which are pressed many fine, closely spaced, specially  bent wires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Comber. A comber is a machine for combing fibers of cotton,  wool, etc. The essential parts are a device for feeding forward a fringe  of fibers at regular intervals and an arrangement of combs or pins  which, at the right time, pass through the fringe. All tangled fibers,  short fibers, and neps are removed and the long fibers are laid  parallel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Combing machinery. Combing machinery is a general  classification, including combers, sliver lap machines, ribbon lap  machines, and gill boxes, but excluding cards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Cutter (rotary staple). A rotary staple cutter is a machine  consisting of one or more rotary blades used for the purpose of cutting  textile fibers into staple lengths.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Exposed to contact. Exposed to contact shall mean that the  location of an object, material, nip point, or point of operation is  such that a person is liable to come in contact with it in his normal  course of employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Garnett machine. A Garnett machine means any of a number of  types of machines for opening hard twisted waste of wool, cotton, silk,  etc. Essentially, such machines consist of a lickerin; one or more  cylinders, each having a complement worker and stripper rolls; and a  fancy roll and doffer. The action of such machines is somewhat like that  of a wool card, but it is much more severe in that the various rolls are  covered with garnett wire instead of card clothing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Gill box. A gill box is a machine used in the worsted system of  manufacturing yarns. Its function is to arrange the fibers in parallel  order.

A kier is a large metal vat, usually a pressure type, in  which fabrics may be boiled out, bleached, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Lapper (ribbon). A ribbon lapper is a machine used to prepare  laps for feeding a cotton comb; its purpose is to provide a uniform lap  in which the fibers have been straightened as much as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Lapper (sliver). A sliver lapper is a machine in which a number  of parallel card slivers are drafted slightly, laid side by side in a  compact sheet, and wound into a cylindrical package.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> Loom. A loom is a machine for effecting the interlacing of two  series of yarns crossing one another at right angles. The warp yarns are  wound on a warp beam and pass through heddles and reed. The filling is  shot across in a shuttle and settled in place by reed and lay, and the  fabric is wound on a cloth beam.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(21)</em> Mangle (starch). A starch mangle is a mangle that is used  specifically for starching cotton goods. It commonly consists of two  large rolls and a shallow open vat with several immersion rolls. The vat  contains the starch solution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(22)</em> Mangle (water). A water mangle is a calender having two or more  rolls used for squeezing water from fabrics before drying. Water mangles  also may be used in other ways during the finishing of various fabrics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(23)</em> Mule.

A roller printing machine is a  machine consisting of a large central cylinder, or pressure bowl, around  the lower part of the perimeter of which is placed a series of engraved  color rollers (each having a color trough), a furnisher roller, doctor  blades, etc. The machine is used for printing fabrics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(29)</em> Ranges (bleaching continuous). Continuous bleaching ranges are  of several types and may be made for cloth in rope or open-width form.  The goods, after wetting out, pass through a squeeze roll into a  saturator containing a solution of caustic soda and then to an enclosed  J-box. A V-shaped arrangement is attached to the front part of the J-box  for uniform and rapid saturation of the cloth with steam before it is  packed down in the J-box. The cloth, in a single strand rope form,  passes over a guide roll down the first arm of the ``V'' and up the  second. Steam is injected into the ``V'' at the upper end of the second  arm so that the cloth is rapidly saturated with steam at this point. The  J-box capacity is such that cloth will remain hot for a sufficient time  to complete the scouring action. It then passes a series of washers with  a squeeze roll in between. The cloth then passes through a second set of  saturator, J-box, and washer, where it is treated with the peroxide  solution. By slight modification of the form of the unit, the same  process can be applied to open-width cloth.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(30)</em> Range (mercerizing). A mercerizing range consists generally of  a 3-bowl mangle, a tenter frame, and a number of boxes for washing and  scouring. The whole setup is in a straight line and all parts operate  continuously. The combination is used to saturate the cloth with sodium  hydroxide, stretch it while   saturated, and washing out most of the caustic before releasing tension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(31)</em> Sanforizing machine. A sanforizing machine is a machine  consisting of a large steam-heated cylinder, an endless, thick, woolen  felt blanket which is in close contact with the cylinder for most of its  perimeter, and an electrically heated shoe which presses the cloth  against the blanket while the latter is in a stretched condition as it  curves around feed-in roll.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(32)</em> Shearing machine. A shearing machine is a machine used in  shearing cloth. Cutting action is provided by a number of steel blades  spirally mounted on a roller. The roller rotates in close contact with a  fixed ledger blade. There may be from one to six such rollers on a  machine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(33)</em> Singeing machine. A singeing machine is a machine used  particularly with cotton; it comprises of a heated roller, plate, or an  open gas flame. The material is rapidly passed over the roller or the  plate or through the open gas flame to remove, fuzz or hairiness on yarn  or cloth by burning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(34)</em> Slasher. A slasher is a machine used for applying a size  mixture to warp yarns. Essentially, it consists of a stand for holding  section beams, a size box, one or more cylindrical dryers or an enclosed  hot air dryer, and a beaming end for finding the yarn on the loom beams.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(35)</em> Solvent (industrial organic). Industrial organic solvent means  any organic volatile liquid or compound, or any combination of these  substances which are used to dissolve or suspend a nonvolatile or  slightly volatile substance for industrial utilization. It shall also  apply to such substances when used as detergents or cleansing agents. It  shall not apply to petroleum products when such products are used as  fuel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(36)</em> Tenter frame. A tenter frame is a machine for drying cloth  under tension. It essentially consists of a pair of endless traveling  chains fitted with clips of fine pins and carried on tracks. The cloth  is firmly held at the selvages by the two chains which diverge as they  move forward so that the cloth is brought to the desired width.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(37)</em> Warper.
