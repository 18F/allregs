They prescribe procedures and methods which the Federal Service Impasses Panel may utilize in the resolution of negotiation impasses when voluntary arrangements, including the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or any other third-party meditation, fail to resolve the disputes. It is the policy of the Panel to encourage labor and management to resolve disputes on terms that are mutually agreeable at any stage of the Panel's procedures.
