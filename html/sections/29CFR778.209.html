                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rules. Where a bonus payment is considered a part of the  regular rate at which an employee is employed, it must be included in  computing his regular hourly rate of pay and overtime compensation. No  difficulty arises in computing overtime compensation if the bonus covers  only one weekly pay period. The amount of the bonus is merely added to  the other earnings of the employee (except statutory exclusions) and the  total divided by total hours worked. Under many bonus plans, however,  calculations of the bonus may necessarily be deferred over a period of  time longer than a workweek. In such a case the employer may disregard  the bonus in computing the regular hourly rate until such time as the  amount of the bonus can be ascertained. Until that is done he may pay  compensation for overtime at one and one-half times the hourly rate paid  by the employee, exclusive of the bonus. When the amount of the bonus  can be ascertained, it must be apportioned back over the workweeks of  the period during which it may be said to have been earned. The employee  must then receive an additional amount of compensation for each workweek  that he worked overtime during the period equal to one-half of the  hourly rate of pay allocable to the bonus for that week multiplied by  the number of statutory overtime hours worked during the week.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allocation of bonus where bonus earnings cannot be identified  with particular workweeks. If it is impossible to   allocate the bonus among the workweeks of the period in proportion to  the amount of the bonus actually earned each week, some other reasonable  and equitable method of allocation must be adopted. For example, it may  be reasonable and equitable to assume that the employee earned an equal  amount of bonus each week of the period to which the bonus relates, and  if the facts support this assumption additional compensation for each  overtime week of the period may be computed and paid in an amount equal  to one-half of the average hourly increase in pay resulting from bonus  allocated to the week, multiplied by the number of statutory overtime  hours worked in that week. Or, if there are facts which make it  inappropriate to assume equal bonus earnings for each workweek, it may  be reasonable and equitable to assume that the employee earned an equal  amount of bonus each hour of the pay period and the resultant hourly  increase may be determined by dividing the total bonus by the number of  hours worked by the employee during the period for which it is paid. The  additional compensation due for the overtime workweeks in the period may  then be computed by multiplying the total number of statutory overtime  hours worked in each such workweek during the period by one-half this  hourly increase.</p>
