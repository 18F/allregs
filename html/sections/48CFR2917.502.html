                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy. It is the policy of DOL to require that interagency  agreements are written to assure that the obligation of fiscal year  funds is valid, that statutory authority exists to obtain or perform the  stated requirements, that the stated requirements are consistent with  DOL's mission responsibilities, and that each agreement complies with  applicable laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. The provisions of this subpart apply to  interagency acquisitions and agreements under the Economy Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appropriations principles. The appropriate use of interagency  acquisitions embodies several principles of Federal appropriations law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In order to record a valid obligation of appropriations, 31  U.S.C. 1501 imposes the requirements that interagency agreements be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A binding written agreement for specific goods or services to  meet an existing bona fide need;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a purpose authorized by law; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Executed and obligated by the receiving agency before the  expiration of available funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Economy Act authorizes interagency acquisitions and provides  for payment in advance, as well as reimbursement to the appropriation  account to which the performance costs have been charged. The Economy  Act further authorizes the servicing agency, as an alternative to  fulfilling the requirement through internal resources, to obtain the  needed supplies or services by contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An agreement entered into under the Economy Act is recorded as  an obligation by the requesting agency the same as a contract. However,  under the Economy Act, the obligated appropriations must be deobligated  upon the date of ``expiration'' of the appropriation account to the  extent that the servicing agency has not incurred obligations through  charged costs or under a contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within DOL, the DOL agencies have a number of statutory  authorities available for entering into interagency agreements. Each DOL  agency, in consultation with the Office of the Solicitor, must be  responsible for determining those authorities, as well as constraints  applicable to the use of advance payments and contractors, and set-up  procedures.</p>
