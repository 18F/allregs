From the breaks so made tobacco to be used in the official sample shall be selected. The official shall, so far as practicable, include tobacco of each quality, color, length, and other characteristics found in the lot in such proportions as would truly represent the lot. In case a lot is found to be damaged,

nested, or in doubtful keeping order, the official sample tag shall be so marked. Official sample tags shall be attached to the sample, in a manner prescribed by the Director.</p>
