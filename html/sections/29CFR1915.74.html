In any event, loads shall not be passed over the means of access while employees are on it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Access to vessels in drydock or between vessels. Gangways meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a) (1), (2), (9), (10), (11) of this section shall be provided for access from wingwall to vessel or, when two or more vessels, other than barges or river towboats, are lying abreast, from one vessel to another.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to barges and river towboats.

When a walkway is impracticable, a substantial straight ladder, extending at least 36 inches above the upper landing surface and adequately secured against shifting or slipping, shall be provided. When conditions are such that neither a walkway nor a straight ladder can be used, a Jacob's ladder in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section may be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The means of access shall be in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (a) (9), (10), and (11) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Jacob's ladders.
