                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. An S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year is the least of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Its taxable income determined by using all rules applying to C corporations and considering only its recognized built-in gain, recognized built-in loss, and recognized built-in gain carryover (pre-limitation amount);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Its taxable income determined by using all rules applying to C corporations as modified by section 1375(b)(1)(B) (taxable income limitation); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount by which its net unrealized built-in gain exceeds its net recognized built-in gain for all prior taxable years (net unrealized built-in gain limitation).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allocation rule. If an S corporation's pre-limitation amount for any taxable year exceeds its net recognized built-in gain for that year, the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain consists of a ratable portion of each item of income, gain, loss, and deduction included in the pre-limitation amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recognized built-in gain carryover. If an S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year is

equal to its taxable income limitation, the amount by which its pre-limitation amount exceeds its taxable income limitation is a recognized built-in gain carryover included in its pre-limitation amount for the succeeding taxable year. The recognized built-in gain carryover consists of that portion of each item of income, gain, loss, and deduction not included in the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for the year the carryover arose, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Accounting methods. In determining its taxable income for pre-limitation amount and taxable income limitation purposes, a corporation must use the accounting method(s) it uses for tax purposes as an S corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Example. The rules of this section are illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth2">Example: Net recognized built-in gain. X is a calendar year C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. X has a net unrealized built-in gain of $50,000 and no net operating loss or capital loss carryforwards. In 1996, X has a pre-limitation amount of $20,000, consisting of ordinary income of $15,000 and capital gain of $5,000, a taxable income limitation of $9,600, and a net unrealized built-in gain limitation of $50,000. Therefore, X's net recognized built-in gain for 1996 is $9,600, because that is the least of the three amounts described in paragraph (a) of this section. Under paragraph (b) of this section, X's net recognized built-in gain consists of recognized built-in ordinary income of $7,200 [$15,000x($9,600/$20,000)=$7,200] and recognized built-in capital gain of $2,400 [$5,000x($9,600/$20,000)=$2,400]. Under paragraph (c) of this section, X has a recognized built-in gain carryover to 1997 of $10,400 ($20,000-$9,600=$10,400), consisting of $7,800 ($15,000-$7,200=$7,800) of recognized built-in ordinary income and $2,600 ($5,000-$2,400=$2,600) of recognized built-in capital gain.
