                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of this part is to prescribe actions, procedures,  and requirements for administration of the Flood Mitigation Assistance  (FMA) program, authorized by Sections 1366 and 1367 of the National  Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4104c and 4104d. The rules in  this part apply to the administration of funds awarded under the FMA  program for which the application period opened prior to December 3,  2007. On or after that date, the administration of funds awarded under  FMA program shall be subject to the rules in part 79 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The purpose of FMA is to assist State and local governments in  funding cost-effective actions that reduce or eliminate the long-term  risk of flood damage to buildings, manufactured homes, and other insured  structures. The long-term goal of FMA is to reduce or eliminate claims  under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) through mitigation  activities. The program provides cost-shared grants for three purposes:  Planning Grants to States and communities to assess the flood risk and  identify actions to reduce that risk; Project Grants to execute measures  to reduce flood losses; and Technical Assistance Grants that States may  use to assist communities to develop viable FMA applications and  implement FMA projects. FMA also outlines a process for development and  approval of Flood Mitigation Plans.  [62 FR 13347, Mar. 20, 1997, as amended at 72 FR 61552, 61738, Oct. 31,  2007]</p>
