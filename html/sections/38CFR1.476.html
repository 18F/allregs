Sec.  1.460 through 1.499 of this part  made with the patient's written consent must be accompanied by a written  statement similar to the following:</p><p class="depth0">This information has been disclosed to you from records protected by  Federal confidentiality rules (38 CFR Part 1). The Federal rules  prohibit you from making any further disclosure of this information  unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent  of the person to whom it pertains or as otherwise permitted by 38 CFR  Part 1.
