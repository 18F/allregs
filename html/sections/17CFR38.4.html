(1) An applicant for designation, or a designated contract market, may request that the Commission approve under section 5c(c) of the Act, any or all of its rules and contract terms and conditions, and subsequent amendments thereto, prior to their implementation or, notwithstanding the provisions of section 5c(c)(4) of the Act, at any time thereafter, under the procedures of Sec. 40.3 or Sec. 40.5 of this chapter, as applicable. A designated contract market may label a future, swap or options product in its rules as ``Listed for trading pursuant to Commission approval,'' if the future, swap or options product and its terms or conditions have been approved by the Commission, and it may label as ``Approved by the Commission'' only those rules that have been so approved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An applicant for designation, or a designated contract market, may request that the Commission approve under section 5c(c) of the Act, any or all of its rules and contract terms and conditions, and subsequent amendments thereto, prior to their implementation or, notwithstanding the provisions of section 5c(c)(4) of the Act, at any time thereafter, under the procedures of Sec. 40.3 or Sec. 40.5 of this chapter, as applicable.

Sec. 40.3(c) and 40.5(c) of this chapter, the operating rules, and terms and conditions of futures, swaps and option products that have been submitted for Commission approval at the same time as an application for contract market designation or an application under Sec. 38.3(b) of this part to reinstate the designation of a dormant designated contract market, as defined in Sec. 40.1 of this chapter, or while one of the foregoing is pending, will be deemed approved by the Commission no earlier than when the facility is deemed to be designated or reinstated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Self-certification of rules and products. Rules of a designated contract market and subsequent amendments thereto, including both operational rules and the terms or conditions of futures, swaps and option products listed for trading on the facility, not voluntarily submitted for prior Commission approval pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, must be submitted to the Commission with a certification that the rule, rule amendment or futures, swap or options product complies with the Act or rules thereunder pursuant to the procedures of Sec. 40.6 of this chapter, as applicable. Provided, however, any rule or rule amendment that would, for a delivery month having open interest, materially change a term or condition of a swap or a contract for future delivery in an agricultural commodity enumerated in section 1a(9) of the Act, or of an option on such contract or commodity, must be submitted to the Commission prior to its implementation for review and approval under Sec. 40.4 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An applicant for designation, or a designated contract market, may request that the Commission consider under the provisions of section 15(b) of the Act any of the contract market's

rules or policies, including both operational rules and the terms or conditions of products listed for trading.
