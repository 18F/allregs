The provisions in the Act  shall take precedence over any part of the Board's regulations in  conflict with the Act. These regulations establish procedures by which  an individual may exercise the rights granted by the Privacy Act to  determine whether a Board system of records contains a record pertaining  to him or her; to gain access to such records; and to request correction  or amendment of such records. These regulations also set identification  requirements and prescribe fees to be charged for copying records.</p>
