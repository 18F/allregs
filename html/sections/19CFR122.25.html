                                Sec. 122.25  Exemption from special landing requirements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Request. Any company or individual that has operational control over an aircraft required to give advance notice of arrival under Sec. 122.23 may request an exemption from the landing requirements in Sec. 122.24. Single overflight exemptions may be granted to entities involved in air ambulance type operations when emergency situations arise and in cases involving the non-emergency transport of persons seeking medical treatment in the U.S. All approvals of requests for overflight exemptions and the granting of authority to be exempted from the landing requirements are at the discretion of the port director. Exemptions may allow aircraft to land at any airport in the U.S. staffed by Customs. Aircraft traveling under an exemption shall continue to follow advance notice and general landing rights requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure. An exemption request shall be made to the port director at the airport at which the majority of Customs overflight processing is desired by the applicant. Except for air ambulance operations and other flights involving the non-emergency transport of persons seeking medical treatment in the U.S., the requests shall be signed by an officer of the company or by the requesting individual and be notarized or witnessed by a Customs officer. The requests shall be submitted:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least 30 days before the anticipated first arrival, if the request is for an exemption covering a number of flights over a period of one year, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least 15 days before the anticipated arrival, if the request is for a single flight, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In cases involving air ambulance operations when emergency situations arise and other flights involving the non-emergency transport of persons seeking medical treatment in the U.S., if time permits, at least 24 hours prior to departure. If this cannot be accomplished, Customs will allow receipt of the overflight exemption application up to departure time. In cases of extreme medical emergency, Customs will accept overflight exemption requests in flight through a Federal Aviation Administration Flight Service Station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Content of request. All requests for exemption from special landing requirements, with the exception of those for air ambulance operations and other flights involving the non-emergency transport of persons seeking medical treatment in the U.S., shall include the following information. Requests for exemptions for air ambulance operations and other flights involving the non-emergency transport of persons for medical treatment in the U.S. shall include the following information except for paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Aircraft registration number(s) and manufacturer's serial number(s) for all aircraft owned or operated by the applicant that will be utilizing the overflight exemption;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification information for each aircraft including class, manufacturer, type, number, color scheme, and type of engine (e.g., turbojet, turbofan, turboprop, reciprocating, helicopter, etc.);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement that the aircraft is equipped with a functioning mode C (altitude reporting) transponder which will be in use during overflight, that the overflights will be made in accord with instrument flight rules (IFR), and that the overflights will be made at altitudes above 12,500 feet mean sea level (unless otherwise instructed by Federal Aviation Administration controllers);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Name and address of the applicant operating the aircraft, if the applicant is a business entity, the address of the headquarters of the business (include state of incorporation if applicable), and the names, addresses, Social Security numbers (if available), and dates of birth of the company officer or individual signing the application. If the aircraft is operated under a lease, include the name, address, Social Security number (if available), and date of birth of the owner if an individual, or the address of the headquarters of the business (include state of incorporation if applicable), and the names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth of the officers of the business;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Individual, signed applications from each usual or anticipated pilot or crewmember for all aircraft for which an overflight exemption is sought stating name, address, Social Security number (if available), Federal Aviation Administration certificate number (if applicable), and place and date of birth;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A statement from the individual signing the application that the pilot(s) and crewmember(s) responding to paragraph (c)(5) of this section are those intended to conduct overflights, and that to the best of the individual's knowledge, the information supplied in response to paragraph (c)(5) of this section is accurate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Names, addresses, Social Security numbers (if applicable), and dates of birth for all usual or anticipated passengers. An approved passenger must be on board to utilize the overflight exemptions.</p><p class="depth3">Note: Where the Social Security number is requested, furnishing of the SSN is voluntary. The authority to collect the SSN is 19 U.S.C. 66, 1433, 1459 and 1624. The primary purpose for requesting the SSN is to assist in ascertaining the identity of the individual so as to assure that only law-abiding persons will be granted permission to land at interior airports in the U.S. without first landing at one of the airports designated in Sec. 122.24. The SSN will be made available to Customs personnel on a need-to-know basis. Failure to provide the SSN may result in a delay in processing of the application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Description of the usual or anticipated baggage or cargo if known, or the actual baggage or cargo;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Description of the applicant's usual business activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Name(s) of the airport(s) of intended first landing in the U.S. Actual overflights will only be permitted to specific approved airports;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Foreign place or places from which flight(s) will usually originate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Reasons for request for overflight exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedure following exemption. (1) If an aircraft subject to Sec. 122.23 is granted an exemption from the landing requirements as provided in this section, the aircraft commander shall notify Customs at least 60 minutes before:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an aircraft subject to Sec. 122.23 is granted an exemption from the landing requirements as provided in this section, the aircraft commander shall notify Customs at least 60 minutes before:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Crossing into the U.S. over a point on the Pacific Coast north of 33 degrees north latitude; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Crossing into the U.S. over a point of the Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic Coast north of 30 degrees north latitude; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Crossing into the U.S. over the Southwestern land border (defined as the U.S.-Mexican border between Brownsville, Texas, and San Diego, California). Southwestern land border crossings must be made while flying in Federal Aviation Administration published airways.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The notice shall be given to a designated airport specified in Sec. 122.24. The notice may be furnished directly to Customs by telephone, radio or other means, or may be furnished through the Federal Aviation Administration to Customs. If notice is furnished pursuant to this paragraph, notice pursuant to Sec. Sec. 122.23 and 122.24 is unnecessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All overflights must be conducted pursuant to an instrument flight plan filed with the Federal Aviation Administration or equivalent foreign aviation authority prior to the commencement of the overflight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner or aircraft commander of an aircraft subject to Sec. 122.23 granted an exemption from the landing requirements must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notify Customs of a change of Federal Aviation Administration or other (foreign) registration number for the aircraft;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notify Customs of the sale, theft, modification or destruction of the aircraft;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notify Customs of changes of usual or anticipated pilots or crewmembers as specified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Every pilot and crewmember participating in an overflight must have prior Customs approval either through initial application and approval, or through a supplemental application submitted by the new pilot or crewmember and approved by Customs before commencement of the pilot's or crewmember's first overflight.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Request permission from Customs to conduct an overflight to an airport not listed in the initial overflight application as specified in paragraph (c)(10) of this section. The request must be directed to the port director who approved the initial request for an overflight exemption.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Retain copies of the initial request for an overflight exemption, all supplemental applications from pilots or crewmembers, and all requests for additional landing privileges as well as a copy of the letter from Customs approving each of these requests. The copies must be carried on board any aircraft during the conduct of an overflight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The notification specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section must be given to Customs within 5 working days of the change, sale, theft, modification, or destruction, or before a flight for which there is an exemption, whichever occurs earlier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Inspection of aircraft having or requesting overflight exemption. Applicants for overflight exemptions must agree to make the subject aircraft available for inspection by Customs to determine if the aircraft is capable of meeting Customs requirements for the proper conduct of an overflight. Inspections may be conducted during the review of an initial application or at any time during the term of an overflight exemption.
