minimize the possibility that one incident will block both escapes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided by paragraph (e) of this section, a vertical ladder ending at a deck scuttle may not be either of the means of escape required by paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A vertical ladder ending at a deck scuttle may be the second means of escape if the--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Primary means of escape is a stairway or passageway;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Installation of another stairway or passageway is impracticable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Scuttle is located where stowed deck cargo could not interfere;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Scuttle is fitted with a quick-acting release, and with a hold-back device to hold it open; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Scuttle meets the requirements for location, strength, and height of coaming in subchapter E of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each vertical ladder must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have rungs that are--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least 410 millimeters (16 inches) long;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At most 300 millimeters (12 inches) apart, uniform for the length of the ladder; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At least 180 millimeters (7 inches) from the nearest permanent object in back of the ladder;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have at least 115 millimeters (4\1/2\ inches) of clearance above each rung;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be made of incombustible materials; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Have an angle of inclination with the horizontal, greater than 70 degrees but not more than 90 degrees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> No means may be provided for locking any interior door giving access to either of the two required means of escape, except that a crash door or locking-device, capable of being easily forced in an emergency, may be employed if a permanent and conspicuous notice to this effect is attached to both sides of the door.
