                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Period of obligation to operate as public housing. The PHA shall  operate all public housing projects in accordance with the CF ACC, as  amended, and applicable HUD regulations, for the statutorily prescribed  period. These periods shall be evidenced by a recorded DOT on all public  housing property. If the PHA uses Capital Funds to develop public  housing or to modernize existing public housing, the CF ACC term and the  covenant to operate those projects are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Development activities. Each public housing project developed  using Capital Funds shall establish a restricted use covenant, either in  the DOT or as a Declaration of Restrictive Covenants, to operate under  the terms and conditions applicable to public housing for a 40-year  period that begins on the date on which the project becomes available  for occupancy, as determined by HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Modernization activities. For PHAs that receive Capital Fund  assistance, the execution of each new CF ACC Amendment establishes an  additional 20-year period that begins on the latest date on which  modernization is completed, except that the additional 20-year period  does not apply to a project that receives Capital Fund assistance only  for management improvements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Operating Fund. Any public housing project developed that  receives Operating Fund assistance shall have a covenant to operate  under requirements applicable to public housing for a 10-year period  beginning upon the conclusion of the fiscal year for which such amounts  were provided, except for such shorter period as permitted by HUD by an  exception.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mortgage or security interests. The PHA shall not allow any  mortgage or security interest in public housing assets, including under  section 30 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437z-2), without prior written  approval from HUD. PHAs that undertake financing unsecured by public  housing assets shall include the following nonrecourse language in all  financing documents as follows:</p><p class="depth2">``This financing is non-recourse to any public housing property  (real or personal property including all public housing assets or  income), or disposition proceeds approved pursuant to Section 18 of the  United States Housing Act of 1937 (unless explicitly permitted by HUD in  the Section 18 approval letter).''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicability of latest expiration date. All public housing  subject to this part or required by law shall be maintained and operated  as public housing, as prescribed, until the latest expiration date  provided in section 9(d)(3) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)(3)) or  any other provision of law or regulation mandating the operation of the  housing as public housing, or under terms and conditions applicable to  public housing, for a specified period of time.</p>
