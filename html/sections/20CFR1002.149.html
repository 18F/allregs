                                Sec. 1002.149  What is the employee's status with his or her civilian
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">During a period of service in the uniformed services, the employee  is deemed to be on furlough or leave of absence from the civilian  employer. In this status, the employee is entitled to the non-seniority  rights and benefits generally provided by the employer to other  employees with similar seniority, status, and pay that are on furlough  or leave of absence. Entitlement to these non-seniority rights and  benefits is not dependent on how the employer characterizes the  employee's status during a period of service. For example, if the  employer characterizes the employee as ``terminated'' during the period  of uniformed service, this characterization cannot be used to avoid  USERRA's requirement that the employee be deemed on furlough or leave of  absence, and therefore entitled to the non-seniority rights and benefits  generally provided to employees on furlough or leave of absence.</p>
