Aerated powders shall mean any powdered material used as a  coating material which shall be fluidized within a container by passing  air uniformly from below. It is common practice to fluidize such  materials to form a fluidized powder bed and then dip the part to be  coated into the bed in a manner similar to that used in liquid dipping.  Such beds are also used as sources for powder spray operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Spraying area. Any area in which dangerous quantities of  flammable vapors or mists, or combustible residues, dusts, or deposits  are present due to the operation of spraying processes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Spray booth. A power-ventilated structure provided to enclose or  accommodate a spraying operation to confine and limit the escape of  spray, vapor, and residue, and to safely conduct or direct them to an  exhaust system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Waterwash spray booth. A spray booth equipped with a water  washing system designed to minimize dusts or residues entering exhaust  ducts and to permit the recovery of overspray finishing material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Dry spray booth. A spray booth not equipped with a water washing  system as described in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph. A dry spray  booth may be equipped with (i) distribution or baffle plates to promote  an even flow of air through the booth or cause the deposit of overspray  before it enters the exhaust duct; or (ii) overspray dry filters to  minimize dusts; or (iii) overspray dry filters to minimize dusts or  residues entering exhaust ducts; or (iv) overspray dry filter rolls  designed to minimize dusts or residues entering exhaust ducts; or (v)  where dry powders are being sprayed, with powder collection systems so  arranged in the exhaust to capture oversprayed material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Fluidized bed. A container holding powder coating material which  is aerated from below so as to form an air-supported expanded cloud of  such material through which the preheated object to be coated is  immersed and transported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Electrostatic fluidized bed. A container holding powder coating  material which is aerated from below so as to form an air-supported  expanded cloud of such material which is electrically charged with a  charge opposite to the charge of the object to be coated; such   object is transported, through the container immediately above the  charged and aerated materials in order to be coated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Approved. Shall mean approved and listed by a nationally  recognized testing laboratory.

Spray booths shall be  substantially constructed of steel, securely and rigidly supported, or  of concrete or masonry except that aluminum or other substantial  noncombustible material may be used for intermittent or low volume  spraying. Spray booths shall be designed to sweep air currents toward  the exhaust outlet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interiors. The interior surfaces of spray booths shall be smooth  and continuous without edges and otherwise designed to prevent pocketing  of residues and facilitate cleaning and washing without injury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Floors. The floor surface of a spray booth and operator's  working area, if combustible, shall be covered with noncombustible  material of such character as to facilitate the safe cleaning and  removal of residues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Distribution or baffle plates. Distribution or baffle plates, if  installed to promote an even flow of air through the booth or cause the  deposit of overspray before it enters the exhaust duct, shall be of  noncombustible material and readily removable or accessible on both  sides for cleaning. Such plates shall not be located in exhaust ducts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Dry type overspray collectors-(exhaust air filters). In  conventional dry type spray booths, overspray dry filters or filter  rolls, if installed, shall conform to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The spraying operations except electrostatic spraying operations  shall be so designed, installed and maintained that the average air  velocity over the open face of the booth (or booth cross section during  spraying operations) shall be not less than 100 linear feet per minute.  Electrostatic spraying operations may be conducted with an air velocity  over the open face of the booth of not less than 60 linear feet per  minute, or more, depending on the volume of the finishing material being  applied and its flammability and explosion characteristics.
