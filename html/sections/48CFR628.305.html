                            <p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Acquisitions for services, including construction but  excluding personal services contracts, requiring contractor personnel to  perform work outside of the United States, shall include the contractual  obligation for coverage under the Defense Base Act (42 U.S.C. Sections  1651-1654, as amended), for covered contractor employees. For the  purposes of this section, ``covered contractor employees'' includes the  following individuals:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> United States citizens or residents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Individuals hired in the United States or its possessions,  regardless of citizenship; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Local nationals and third country nationals where contract  performance takes place in a country where there are no local workers'  compensation laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Individuals who are self-employed (i.e., they have not  incorporated) do not meet the definition of an employee. No Defense Base  Act insurance is required when contracting with these individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exceptions are discussed in paragraphs (e)(1) and (f) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em>, is reserved to the Secretary of State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary of Labor has waived the applicability of the  Defense Base Act to all DOS service contracts, including construction,  for contractor employees who are local nationals or third country  nationals. This waiver is conditioned on the requirement for the  contractor to provide workers' compensation benefits against the risk of  work injury or death and assume liability toward the employees and their  beneficiaries for war-hazard injury, death, capture, or detention as  prescribed by the local workers' compensation laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In cases where a contract is performed in a country where there  are no local workers' compensation laws, local and third country  national contractor employees are considered to be ``covered contractor  employees'', and the contractor shall acquire Defense Base Act insurance  for those employees pursuant to the contract between the Department of  State and the Defense Base Act insurance broker.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 16 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act (22  U.S.C. 2680a), as amended, provides that the Defense Base Act shall not  apply with respect to such contracts as the Secretary of State  determines are contracts with persons employed to perform work for the  Department of State on an intermittent basis for not more than 90 days  in a calendar year. The Department of State has established that  ``persons'' includes employees hired by companies under contract with  the Department. The Procurement Executive has the authority to issue the  waivers for employees who work on an intermittent or short-term basis.  Waivers may be issued only for employees who are U.S. citizens and  residents, and only where the contractor provides evidence of  alternative workers' compensation coverage for those employees. Waivers  may not   be issued for local or third country nationals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The contractor shall submit waiver requests to the contracting  officer. The request shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Contract number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Name of contractor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Brief description of the services to be provided under the  contract and country of performance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Name and position title of individual(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Nationality of individual(s) (must be U.S. citizen or resident);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Dates (or timeframe) of performance at the overseas location;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Evidence of alternative workers' compensation coverage for  these employees (e.g., evidence that the State workers' compensation  program covers workers on short-term foreign assignments).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The contracting officer shall review the request for  completeness and accuracy. If the request is complete and accurate, the  contracting officer shall forward the request to the Procurement  Executive. If the contractor does not provide complete and accurate  information, the contracting officer shall return the request to the  contractor with an explanation as to what additional information is  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Procurement Executive shall review requests for waiver  forwarded by the contracting officer and either approve or disapprove  the request. The Procurement Executive shall return the request  indicating his/her approval or disapproval to the contracting officer.  Any request that is not approved shall describe the reason(s) why the  request was not approved. The contracting officer shall provide the  contractor with the original of the approved or disapproved document and  maintain a copy in the contract file.
