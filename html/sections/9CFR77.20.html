                            <p class="depth0">As used in subpart C, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth in this section except as otherwise specified.</p><p class="depth0">Accreditation preparatory State or zone. A State or zone that is or is part of a State that has the authority to enforce and complies with the provisions of the ``Uniform Methods and Rules--Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication'' and in which tuberculosis is prevalent in less than 0.5 percent of the total number of herds of captive cervids in the State or zone.</p><p class="depth0">Accredited herd. A herd of captive cervids that has tested negative to at least two consecutive official tuberculosis tests of all eligible captive cervids in accordance with Sec. 77.33(f) and that meets the standards set forth in Sec. 77.35. The tests must be conducted at 9-15 month intervals.</p><p class="depth0">Accredited-free State or zone. A State or zone that is or is part of a State that has the authority to enforce and complies with the provisions of the ``Uniform Methods and Rules--Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication,'' has zero percent prevalence of affected captive cervid herds, and has had no findings of tuberculosis in any captive cervid herds in the State or zone for the previous 5 years. Except that: The requirement of freedom from tuberculosis in herds is 2 years from the depopulation of the last affected herd in States or zones that were previously accredited free and in which all herds affected with tuberculosis were depopulated, 3 years in all other States or zones that have depopulated all affected herds, and 3 years in States or zones that have conducted surveillance that demonstrates that other livestock herds and wildlife are not at risk of being infected with tuberculosis, as determined by the Administrator based on a risk assessment conducted by APHIS.</p><p class="depth0">Captive cervid. All species of deer, elk, moose, and all other members of the family Cervidae raised or maintained in captivity for the production of meat and other agricultural products, for sport, or for exhibition, including time such animals are moved interstate; or any wild cervid that is moved interstate, during the period of time from capture until release into the wild. A captive cervid that escapes will continue to be considered a captive cervid as long as it bears an official eartag or other identification approved by the Administrator as unique and traceable with which to trace the animal back to its herd of origin.</p><p class="depth0">Comparative cervical tuberculin (CCT) test. The intradermal injection of biologically balanced USDA bovine PPD tuberculin and avian PPD tuberculin at separate sites in the mid-cervical area to determine the probable presence of bovine tuberculosis (M. bovis) by comparing the response of the two tuberculins at 72 hours (plus or minus 6 hours) following injection.</p><p class="depth0">Designated accredited veterinarian. An accredited veterinarian who is trained and approved by cooperating State and Federal animal health officials to conduct the single cervical tuberculin (SCT) test or draw blood for the DPP[supreg] test on captive cervids.</p><p class="depth0">Dual Path Platform (DPP[supreg]) test. A serological assay to determine the presence of antibodies to bovine tuberculosis (M. bovis) in elk, red deer, white-tailed deer, fallow deer, and reindeer, in which a blood sample taken from a captive cervid and a buffer solution are placed on a strip. The diluted sample then migrates to another strip, which contains an antibody-detecting reagent. This latter strip indicates if antibodies are present in the sample.</p><p class="depth0">Exposed captive cervid. Any captive cervid that has been exposed to tuberculosis by reason of associating with captive cervids, cattle, bison, or other livestock from which M. bovis has been isolated.</p><p class="depth0">Modified accredited State or zone. A State or zone that is or is part of a State that has the authority to enforce and complies with the provisions of the ``Uniform Methods and Rules--Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication'' and in which tuberculosis has been prevalent in less than 0.1 percent of the total number of herds of captive cervids in the State or zone for the most recent year. Except that: The Administrator, upon his or her review, may allow a State or zone with fewer than 10,000 herds to have up to 10 affected herds for the most recent year, depending on the veterinary infrastructure, livestock demographics, and tuberculosis control and eradication measures in the State or zone.</p><p class="depth0">Modified accredited advanced State or zone. A State or zone that is or is part of a State that has the authority to enforce and complies with the provisions of the ``Uniform Methods and Rules--Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication'' and in which tuberculosis has been prevalent in less than 0.01 percent of the total number of herds of captive cervids in the State or zone for the most recent 2 years. Except that: The Administrator, upon his or her review, may allow a State or zone with fewer than 30,000 herds to have up to 3 affected herds for each of the most recent 2 years, depending on the veterinary infrastructure, livestock demographics, and tuberculosis control and eradication measures in the State or zone.</p><p class="depth0">Monitored herd. A herd on which identification records are maintained on captive cervids inspected for tuberculosis at an approved slaughtering establishment or an approved diagnostic laboratory and on captive cervids tested for tuberculosis in accordance with interstate movement requirements, and which meets the standards set forth in Sec. 77.37.</p><p class="depth0">Negative. Showing no response to an official tuberculosis test or classified negative for tuberculosis by the testing veterinarian based upon history, supplemental tests, examination of the carcass, and histopathology and culture of selected tissues.</p><p class="depth0">No gross lesions (NGL). Having no visible lesions indicative of bovine tuberculosis detected upon necropsy or slaughter inspection.</p><p class="depth0">Nonaccredited State or zone. A State or zone that is or is part of a State or zone that does not meet the standards of the ``Uniform Methods and Rules--Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication'' or in which tuberculosis is prevalent in 0.5 percent or more of the total number of herds of captive cervids in the State or zone.</p><p class="depth0">Official tuberculosis test. Any of the following tests for bovine tuberculosis in captive cervids, applied and reported in accordance with this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The single cervical tuberculin (SCT) test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The comparative cervical tuberculin test (CCT) test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The Dual Path Platform (DPP[supreg]) test.</p><p class="depth2">Permit. An official document issued by a representative of APHIS, a State representative, or an accredited veterinarian that must accompany any reactor, suspect, or exposed captive cervid moved interstate.</p><p class="depth2">Purified protein derivative (PPD). Protein extract from an M. bovis culture that is resuspended in solution at a standard concentration of 1 mg protein per 1 mL of solution.</p><p class="depth2">Qualified herd. A herd of captive cervids that has tested negative to at least one official tuberculosis test of all eligible captive cervids (see Sec. 77.33(f)) within the past 12 months and that is not classified as an accredited herd.</p><p class="depth2">Quarantine. Prohibition from interstate movement, except for slaughter or necropsy.</p><p class="depth2">Reactor. Any captive cervid that shows a response to an official tuberculosis test and is classified a reactor by the testing veterinarian; or any suspect captive cervid that is classified a reactor upon slaughter inspection or necropsy after histopathology and/or culture of selected tissues by the USDA or State veterinarian performing or supervising the slaughter inspection or necropsy.</p><p class="depth2">Regular-kill slaughter animal. An animal that is slaughtered for food or any reason other than because of a disease regulated under 9 CFR chapter I (such as tuberculosis, brucellosis, or any other livestock disease for which movement of animals is restricted under 9 CFR chapter I).</p><p class="depth2">Single cervical tuberculin (SCT) test. The intradermal injection of 0.1 mL (5,000 tuberculin units) of USDA PPD bovis tuberculin in the mid-cervical area with a reading by visual observation and palpation at 72 hours (plus or minus 6 hours) following injection.</p><p class="depth2">Suspect. Any captive cervid that is not negative to an official tuberculosis test and that is not classified as a reactor by the testing veterinarian.</p><p class="depth2">Tuberculin. A product that is approved by and produced under USDA license for injection into cervids and other animals for the purpose of detecting bovine tuberculosis.</p><p class="depth2">Tuberculous. Having lesions indicative of tuberculosis, infected with tuberculosis based on isolation of M. bovis, or being from a herd in which M. bovis has been isolated.</p><p class="depth2">USDA. The United States Department of Agriculture.</p><p class="depth2">Whole herd test. An official tuberculosis test of all captive cervids in a herd that are 12 months of age or older, and of all captive cervids in the herd that are less than 12 months of age and were not born into the herd, except those captive cervids that are less than 12 months of age and were born in and originated from an accredited herd.</p><p class="depth2">Zero percent prevalence. No finding of tuberculosis in any herd of captive cervids in a State or zone.
