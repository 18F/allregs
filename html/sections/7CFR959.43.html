Such reserve funds may be used (i) to defray expenses  during any fiscal period prior to the time assessment income is  sufficient to cover such expenses, (ii) to cover deficits incurred  during any fiscal period when assessment income is less than expenses,  (iii) to defray expenses incurred during any period when any or all  provisions of this part are suspended or are inoperative, (iv) to cover  necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this  part. Upon such termination, any funds not required to defray the  necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as  the Secretary may determine to be appropriate. To the extent practical,  such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such  funds were collected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions  of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part  and shall be accounted for in the manner provided for in this part. The  Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to  account for all receipts and disbursements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon the removal or expiration of the term of office of any  member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and  disbursements and deliver all property and funds in his possession to  the committee, and shall execute such assignments and other instruments  as may be necessary or appropriate to vest in the committee full title  to all of the property, funds, and claims vested in such member pursuant  to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The committee may make recommendations to the Secretary for one  or more of the members thereof, or any other person, to act as a trustee  for holding records, funds, or any other committee property during  periods of suspension of this subpart, or during any period or periods  when regulations are not in effect and if the Secretary determines such  action appropriate, he may direct that such person or persons shall act  as trustee or trustees for the committee.
