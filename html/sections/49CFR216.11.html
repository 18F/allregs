The Special Notice sets out and describes the defects that cause the car to be in unserviceable condition. After receipt of the Special Notice, the railroad shall remove the car from service until it is restored to serviceable condition. The car may not be deemed to be in serviceable condition until it complies with all applicable requirements of part 215 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The railroad shall notify the FRA Regional Administrator in writing when the equipment is returned to service, specifying the repairs completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A railroad freight car subject to the notice prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section may be moved from the place where it was found to be unsafe

for further service to the nearest available point where the car can be repaired, if such movement is necessary to make such repairs. However, the movement is subject to the further restrictions of Sec. 215.9 of this chapter.
