The extended funnel BRD consists of an extension with large-mesh webbing in the center (the large-mesh escape section) and small-mesh webbing on each end held open by a semi-rigid hoop. A funnel of small-mesh webbing is placed inside the extension to form a passage for shrimp to the cod end. It also creates an area of reduced water flow to allow for fish escapement through the large mesh. One side of the funnel is extended vertically to form a lead panel and area of reduced water flow. There are two sizes of extended funnel BRDs, a standard size and an inshore size for small trawls.</p><p class="depth0">2. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements for Standard Size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Extension Material. The small-mesh sections used on both sides of the large-mesh escape section are constructed of 1\5/8\ inch (4.13 cm), No. 30 stretched mesh, nylon webbing. The front section is 120 meshes around by 6\1/2\

meshes deep. The back section is 120 meshes around by 23 meshes deep.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Large-Mesh Escape Section. The large-mesh escape section is constructed of 8 to 10 inch (20.3 to 25.4 cm), stretched mesh, webbing. This section is cut on the bar to form a section that is 15 inches (38.1 cm) in length by 95 inches (241.3 cm) in circumference. The leading edge is attached to the 6\1/2\-mesh extension section and the rear edge is attached to the 23-mesh extension section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Funnel. The funnel is constructed of 1\1/2\ inch (3.81 cm), stretched mesh, No. 30 depth-stretched and heat-set polyethylene webbing. The circumference of the leading edge is 120 meshes and the back edge is 78 meshes. The short side of the funnel is 34 to 36 inches (86.4 to 91.4 cm) long and the opposite side of the funnel extends an additional 22 to 24 inches (55.9 to 61.0 cm). The circumference of the leading edge of the funnel is attached to the forward small-mesh section three meshes forward of the large-mesh escape section and is evenly sewn, mesh for mesh, to the small-mesh section. The after edge of the funnel is attached to the after small-mesh section at its top and bottom eight meshes back from the large-mesh escape panel. Seven meshes of the top and seven meshes of the bottom of the funnel are attached to eight meshes at the top and bottom of the small-mesh section, such eight meshes being located immediately adjacent to the top and bottom centers of the small-mesh section on the side of the funnel's extended side. The extended side of the funnel is sewn at its top and bottom to the top and bottom of the small-mesh section, extending at an angle toward the top and bottom centers of the small-mesh section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Semi-Rigid Hoop. A 30-inch (76.2-cm) diameter hoop constructed of plastic-coated trawl cable, swaged together with a \3/8\-inch (9.53-mm) micropress sleeve, is installed five meshes behind the trailing edge of the large-mesh escape section. The extension webbing must be laced to the ring around the entire circumference and must be equally distributed on the hoop, that is, 30 meshes must be evenly attached to each quadrant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Installation. The extended funnel BRD is attached 8 inches (20.3 cm) behind the posterior edge of the TED. If it is attached behind a soft TED, a second semi-rigid hoop, as prescribed in paragraph A.2.(d), must be installed in the front section of the BRD extension webbing at the leading edge of the funnel. The cod end of the trawl net is attached to the trailing edge of the BRD.</p><p class="depth0">3. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements for Inshore Size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Extension Material. The small-mesh sections used on both sides of the large-mesh escape section are constructed of 1\3/8\ inch (3.5 cm), No. 18 stretched mesh, nylon webbing. The front section is 120 meshes around by 6\1/2\ meshes deep. The back section is 120 meshes around by 23 meshes deep.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Large-Mesh Escape Section. The large-mesh escape section is constructed of 8 to 10 inch (20.3 to 25.4 cm), stretched mesh, webbing. This section is cut on the bar to form a section that is 15 inches (38.1 cm) by 75 inches (190.5 cm) in circumference. The leading edge is attached to the 6\1/2\-mesh extension section and the rear edge is attached to the 23-mesh extension section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Funnel. The funnel is constructed of 1\3/8\ inch (3.5 cm), stretched mesh, No. 18 depth-stretched and heat-set polyethylene webbing. The circumference of the leading edge is 120 meshes and the back edge is 78 meshes. The short side of the funnel is 30 to 32 inches (76.2 to 81.3 cm) long and the opposite side of the funnel extends an additional 20 to 22 inches (50.8 to 55.9 cm). The circumference of the leading edge of the funnel is attached to the forward small-mesh section three meshes forward of the large-mesh escape section and is evenly sewn, mesh for mesh, to the small-mesh section. The after edge of the funnel is attached to the after small-mesh section at its top and bottom eight meshes back from the large-mesh escape panel. Seven meshes of the top and seven meshes of the bottom of the funnel are attached to eight meshes at the top and bottom of the small-mesh section, such eight meshes being located immediately adjacent to the top and bottom centers of the small-mesh section on the side of the funnel's extended side. The extended side of the funnel is sewn at its top and bottom to the top and bottom of the small-mesh section, extending at an angle toward the top and bottom centers of the small-mesh section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Semi-Rigid Hoop. A 24-inch (61.0-cm) diameter hoop constructed of plastic-coated trawl cable, swaged together with a \3/8\-inch (9.53-mm) micropress sleeve, is installed five meshes behind the trailing edge of the large mesh section. The extension webbing must be laced to the ring around the entire circumference and must be equally distributed on the hoop, that is, 30 meshes must be evenly attached to each quadrant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Installation. The extended funnel BRD is attached 8 inches (20.3 cm) behind the posterior edge of the TED. If it is attached behind a soft TED, a second semi-rigid hoop, as prescribed in paragraph A.3.(d), must be installed in the front section of the BRD extension webbing at the leading edge of the funnel. The cod end of the trawl net is attached to the trailing edge of the BRD.</p><p class="depth0">B. Expanded Mesh. The expanded mesh BRD is constructed and installed exactly the same as the standard size extended funnel BRD, except that one side of the funnel is not extended to form a lead panel.</p><p class="depth0">C. Fisheye.</p><p class="depth0">1. Description. The fisheye BRD is a cone-shaped rigid frame constructed from aluminum or steel rod of at least \1/4\ inch (6.35-mm) diameter, which is inserted into the cod end to form an escape opening.</p><p class="depth0">2. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements. The fisheye has a minimum escape opening dimension of 5 inches (12.7 cm) and a minimum total escape opening area of 36 in\2\ (91.4 cm\2\). When the fisheye BRD is installed, no part of the lazy line attachment system (i.e., any mechanism, such as elephant ears or choker straps, used to attach the lazy line to the cod end) may overlap the fisheye escape opening when the fisheye is installed aft of the attachment point of the cod end retrieval system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In the Gulf EEZ, the fisheye BRD must be installed at the top center of the cod end of the trawl to create an opening in the trawl facing in the direction of the mouth of the trawl no further forward than 9 ft (2.7 m) from the cod end drawstring (tie-off rings).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the South Atlantic EEZ, the fisheye BRD must be installed at the top center of the cod end of the trawl to create an escape opening in the trawl facing the direction of the mouth of the trawl no further forward than 11 ft (3.4 m) from the cod end tie-off rings.</p><p class="depth0">D. Gulf fisheye.</p><p class="depth0">1. Description. The Gulf fisheye is a cone-shaped rigid frame constructed from aluminum or steel rod of at least \1/4\ inch (6.35-mm) diameter, which is inserted into the top center of the cod end, and is offset not more than 15 meshes perpendicular to the top center of the cod end to form an escape opening.</p><p class="depth0">2. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements. The Gulf fisheye has a minimum escape opening dimension of 5 inches (12.7 cm) and a minimum total escape opening area of 36 in\2\ (91.4 cm\2\). To be used in the South Atlantic EEZ, the Gulf fisheye BRD must be installed in the cod end of the trawl to create an escape opening in the trawl, facing in the direction of the mouth of the trawl, no less than 8.5 ft (2.59 m) and no further forward than 12.5 ft (3.81 m) from the cod end tie-off rings, and may be offset no more than 15 meshes perpendicular to the top center of the cod end. When the Gulf fisheye BRD is installed, no part of the lazy line attachment system (i.e., any mechanism, such as elephant ears or choker straps, used to attach the lazy line to the cod end) may overlap the fisheye escape opening when the fisheye is installed aft of the attachment point of the cod end retrieval system.</p><p class="depth0">E.

The funnel must be constructed from four sections of 1\1/2\-inch (3.8-cm) heat-set and depth-stretched polypropylene or polyethylene webbing. The two side sections must be rectangular in shape, 29\1/2\ meshes on the leading edge by 23 meshes deep. The top and bottom sections are 29\1/2\ meshes on the leading edge by 23 meshes deep and tapered 1 point 2 bars on both sides down to 8 meshes across the back. The four sections must be sewn together down the 23-mesh edge to form the funnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Attachment of the funnel in the webbing extension. The funnel must be installed two meshes behind the leading edge of the extension starting at the center seam of the extension and the center mesh of the funnel's

top section leading edge. On the same row of meshes, the funnel must be sewn evenly all the way around the inside of the extension. The funnel's top and bottom back edges must be attached one mesh behind the 28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop (front hoop). Starting at the top center seam, the back edge of the top funnel section must be attached four meshes each side of the center.

The four escape openings must be double selvaged for strength.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Alternative Method for Constructing the Funnel and Escape Openings. The following method for constructing the funnel and escape openings may be used instead of the method described in paragraphs F.2.d., F.2.e., and F.2.f. of this section. With this alternative method, the funnel and escape openings are formed by cutting a flap in each side of the extension webbing; pushing the flaps inward; and attaching the top and bottom edges along the bars of the extension webbing to form the v-shape of the funnel. Minimum requirements applicable to this method include: The funnel's top and bottom back edges must be attached one mesh behind the 28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop (front hoop); clearance between the side of the funnel and the 28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop (front hoop) must be at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) when measured in the hanging position; the leading edge of the escape opening must be located within 18 inches (45.7 cm) of the posterior edge of the turtle excluder device (TED) grid; and, the area of the escape opening must total at least 864 in\2\ (5,574.2 cm\2\). To construct the funnel and escape openings using this method, begin 3\1/2\ meshes from the leading edge of the extension, at the top center seam, count over 18 meshes on each side, and cut 13 meshes toward the back of the extension. Turn parallel to the leading edge, and cut 26 meshes toward the bottom center of the extension. Next, turn parallel to the top center seam, and cut 13 meshes forward toward the leading edge, creating a flap of webbing 13 meshes by 26 meshes by 13 meshes. Lengthen the flap to 18 meshes by adding a 4\1/2\-mesh by 26-mesh rectangular section of webbing to the 26-mesh edge. Attach the 18-mesh edges to the top and bottom of the extension by sewing 2 bars of the extension to 1 mesh on the flap in toward the top center and bottom center of the extension, forming the exit opening and the funnel. Connect the two flaps together in the center with a 7-inch piece of number 42 twine to allow adequate clearance for fish escapement between the flaps and the side openings. On each side, sew a 6-mesh by 10\1/2\-mesh section of webbing to 6 meshes of the center of the 26-mesh cut on the extension and 6 meshes centered between the 13-mesh cuts 3\1/2\ meshes from the leading edge. This forms two 10-mesh by 13-mesh openings on each side.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Cone fish deflector. The cone fish deflector is constructed of 2 pieces of 1\5/8\-inch (4.13-cm) polypropylene or polyethylene webbing, 40 meshes wide by 20 meshes in length and cut on the bar on each side forming a triangle. Starting at the apex of the two triangles, the two pieces must be sewn together to form a cone of webbing. The apex of the cone fish deflector must be positioned within 10-14 inches (25.4-35.6 cm) of the posterior edge of the funnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 11-inch (27.9-cm) cable hoop for cone deflector.

The hoop must be inserted in the webbing cone, attached 10 meshes from the apex and laced all the way around with heavy twine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Installation of the cone in the extension. The cone must be installed in the extension 12 inches (30.5 cm) behind the back edge of the funnel and attached in four places. The midpoint of a piece of number 60 twine 4 ft (1.22 m) in length must be attached to the apex of the cone. This piece of twine must be attached to the 28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop at the center of each of its sides; the points of attachment for the two pieces of twine must be measured 20 inches (50.8 cm) from the midpoint attachment. Two 8-inch (20.3-cm) pieces of number 60 twine must be attached to the top and bottom of the 11-inch (27.9-cm) cone hoop. The opposite ends of these two pieces of twine must be attached to the top and bottom center of the 24-inch (61-cm) cable hoop; the points of attachment for the two pieces of twine must be measured 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the points where they are tied to the 11-inch (27.9-cm) cone hoop.</p><p class="depth0">F.

[78 FR 33258, June 4, 2013]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix F to Part 622--Specifications for Sea Turtle Mitigation</p><p class="depth0">Gear and Sea Turtle Handling and Release Requirements</p><p class="depth0">A. Sea turtle mitigation gear.</p><p class="depth0">1. Long-handled line clipper or cutter. Line cutters are intended to cut high test monofilament line as close as possible to the hook, and assist in removing line from entangled sea turtles to minimize any remaining gear upon release. NMFS has established minimum design standards for the line cutters. The LaForce line cutter and the Arceneaux line clipper are models that meet these minimum design standards, and may be purchased or fabricated from readily available and low-cost materials. One long-handled line clipper or cutter and a set of replacement blades are required to be onboard. The minimum design standards for line cutters are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A protected and secured cutting blade. The cutting blade(s) must be capable of cutting 2.0-2.1 mm (0.078 in.-0.083 in.) monofilament line (400-lb test) or polypropylene multistrand material, known as braided or tarred mainline, and must be maintained in working order. The cutting blade must be curved, recessed, contained in a holder, or otherwise designed to facilitate its safe use so that direct contact between the cutting surface and the sea turtle or the user is prevented. The cutting instrument must be securely attached to an extended reach handle and be easily replaceable. One extra set of replacement blades meeting these standards must also be carried on board to replace all cutting surfaces on the line cutter or clipper.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An extended reach handle. The line cutter blade must be securely fastened to an extended reach handle or pole with a minimum length equal to, or greater than, 150 percent of the freeboard, or a minimum of 6 ft (1.83 m), whichever is greater. It is recommended, but not required, that the handle break down into sections. There is no restriction on the type of material used to construct this handle as long as it is sturdy and facilitates the secure attachment of the cutting blade.</p><p class="depth0">2. Long-handled dehooker for internal hooks. A long-handled dehooking device is intended to remove internal hooks from sea turtles that cannot be boated. It should also be used to engage a loose hook when a turtle is entangled but not hooked, and line is being removed. The design must shield the barb of the hook and prevent it from re-engaging during the removal process. One long-handled device to remove internal hooks is required onboard. The minimum design standards are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Hook removal device. The hook removal device must be constructed of approximately \3/16\-inch (4.76 mm) to \5/16\-inch (7.94 mm) 316 L stainless steel or similar material and have a dehooking end no larger than 1 \7/8\-inches (4.76 cm) outside diameter. The device must securely engage and control the leader while shielding the barb to prevent the hook from re-engaging during removal. It may not have any unprotected terminal points (including blunt ones), as these could cause injury to

the esophagus during hook removal. The device must be of a size appropriate to secure the range of hook sizes and styles used in the South Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Extended reach handle. The dehooking end must be securely fastened to an extended reach handle or pole with a minimum length equal to or greater than 150 percent of the freeboard, or a minimum of 6 ft (1.83 m), whichever is greater. It is recommended, but not required, that the handle break down into sections. The handle must be sturdy and strong enough to facilitate the secure attachment of the hook removal device.</p><p class="depth0">3. Long-handled dehooker for external hooks. A long-handled dehooker is required for use on externally-hooked sea turtles that cannot be boated. The long-handled dehooker for internal hooks described in paragraph 2. of this Appendix F would meet this requirement. The minimum design standards are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Construction. A long-handled dehooker must be constructed of approximately \3/16\-inch (4.76 mm) to \5/16\-inch (7.94 mm) 316 L stainless steel rod and have a dehooking end no larger than 1 \7/8\-inches (4.76 cm) outside diameter. The design should be such that a fish hook can be rotated out, without pulling it out at an angle. The dehooking end must be blunt with all edges rounded. The device must be of a size appropriate to secure the range of hook sizes and styles used in the South Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Extended reach handle. The handle must be a minimum length equal to the freeboard of the vessel or 6 ft (1.83 m), whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth0">4. Long-handled device to pull an ``inverted V''. This tool is used to pull a ``V'' in the fishing line when implementing the ``inverted V''; dehooking technique, as described in the document entitled ``Careful Release Protocols for Sea Turtle Release With Minimal Injury,'' for disentangling and dehooking entangled sea turtles. One long-handled device to pull an ``inverted V'' is required onboard. If a 6-ft (1.83 m) J-style dehooker is used to comply with paragraph 4. of this Appendix F, it will also satisfy this requirement. Minimum design standards are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Hook end. This device, such as a standard boat hook, gaff, or long-handled J-style dehooker, must be constructed of stainless steel or aluminum. The semicircular or ``J'' shaped end must be securely attached to a handle. A sharp point, such as on a gaff hook, is to be used only for holding the monofilament fishing line and should never contact the sea turtle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Extended reach handle. The handle must have a minimum length equal to the freeboard of the vessel, or 6 ft (1.83 m), whichever is greater. The handle must be sturdy and strong enough to facilitate the secure attachment of the gaff hook.</p><p class="depth0">5. Dipnet. One dipnet is required onboard. Dipnets are to be used to facilitate safe handling of sea turtles by allowing them to be brought onboard for fishing gear removal, without causing further injury to the animal. Turtles must not be brought onboard without the use of a dipnet or hoist. The minimum design standards for dipnets are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Size of dipnet. The dipnet must have a sturdy net hoop of at least 31 inches (78.74 cm) inside diameter and a bag depth of at least 38 inches (96.52 cm) to accommodate turtles below 3 ft (0.914 m) carapace length. The bag mesh openings may not exceed 3 inches (7.62 cm) by 3 inches (7.62 cm). There must be no sharp edges or burrs on the hoop, or where it is attached to the handle. There is no requirement for the hoop to be circular as long as it meets the minimum specifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Extended reach handle. The dipnet hoop must be securely fastened to an extended reach handle or pole with a minimum length equal to, or greater than, 150 percent of the freeboard, or at least 6 ft (1.83 m), whichever is greater. The handle must be made of a rigid material strong enough to facilitate the sturdy attachment of the net hoop and be able to support a minimum of 100 lb (34.1 kg) without breaking or significant bending or distortion. It is recommended, but not required, that the extended reach handle break down into sections.</p><p class="depth0">6. Cushion/support device. A standard automobile tire (free of exposed steel belts), a boat cushion, a large turtle hoist, or any other comparable cushioned elevated surface, is required for supporting a turtle in an upright orientation while the turtle is onboard. The cushion/support device must be appropriately sized to fully support a range of turtle sizes.</p><p class="depth0">7. Short-handled dehooker for internal hooks. One short-handled device for removing internal hooks is required onboard. This dehooker is designed to remove ingested hooks from boated sea turtles. It can also be used on external hooks or hooks in the front of the mouth. Minimum design standards are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Hook removal device. The hook removal device must be constructed of approximately \3/16\-inch (4.76 mm) to \5/16\-inch (7.94 mm) 316 L stainless steel, and must allow the hook to be secured and the barb shielded without re-engaging during the removal process. It must be no larger than 1 \7/8\-inches (4.76 cm) outside diameter. It may not have any unprotected terminal points (including blunt ones), as this could cause injury to the esophagus during hook removal. A sliding PVC bite block must be used to protect the beak and facilitate hook removal if the turtle bites down on the dehooking device. The bite block should be constructed of a \3/4\-inch (1.91 cm) inside diameter high impact plastic

cylinder (e.g., Schedule 80 PVC) that is 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) long to allow for 5 inches (12.7 cm) of slide along the shaft. The device must be of a size appropriate to secure the range of hook sizes and styles used in the South Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Handle length. The handle should be approximately 16 to 24 inches (40.64 cm to 60.69 cm) in length, with approximately a 4 to 6-inch (10.2 to 15.2-cm) long tube T-handle of approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter.</p><p class="depth0">8. Short-handled dehooker for external hooks. One short-handled dehooker for external hooks is required onboard. The short-handled dehooker for internal hooks required to comply with paragraph 7. of this Appendix F will also satisfy this requirement. Minimum design standards are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Hook removal device. The dehooker must be constructed of approximately \3/16\-inch (4.76 cm) to \5/16\-inch (7.94 cm) 316 L stainless steel, and the design must be such that a hook can be rotated out without pulling it out at an angle. The dehooking end must be blunt, and all edges rounded. The device must be of a size appropriate to secure the range of hook sizes and styles used in the South Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Handle length. The handle should be approximately 16 to 24 inches (40.64 to 60.69 cm) long with approximately a 5-inch (12.7 cm) long tube T-handle, wire loop handle or similar, of approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter.</p><p class="depth0">9. Long-nose or needle-nose pliers. One pair of long-nose or needle-nose pliers is required on board. Required long-nose or needle-nose pliers can be used to remove deeply embedded hooks from the turtle's flesh that must be twisted during removal or for removing hooks from the front of the mouth. They can also hold PVC splice couplings, when used as mouth openers, in place. Minimum design standards are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. They must be approximately 12 inches (30.48 cm) in length, and should be constructed of stainless steel material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">10. Bolt cutters. One pair of bolt cutters is required on board. Required bolt cutters may be used to cut hooks to facilitate their removal. They should be used to cut off the eye or barb of a hook, so that it can safely be pushed through a sea turtle without causing further injury. They should also be used to cut off as much of the hook as possible, when the remainder of the hook cannot be removed. Minimum design standards are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. They must be approximately 14 to 17 inches (35.56 to 43.18 cm) in total length, with approximately 4-inch (10.16 cm) long blades that are 2\1/4\ inches (5.72 cm) wide, when closed, and with approximately 10 to 13-inch (25.4 to 33.02-cm) long handles. Required bolt cutters must be able to cut hard metals, such as stainless or carbon steel hooks, up to \1/4\-inch (6.35 mm) diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">11. Monofilament line cutters. One pair of monofilament line cutters is required on board. Required monofilament line cutters must be used to remove fishing line as close to the eye of the hook as possible, if the hook is swallowed or cannot be removed. Minimum design standards are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Monofilament line cutters must be approximately 7\1/2\ inches (19.05 cm) in length. The blades must be 1 inch (4.45 cm) in length and \5/8\ inches (1.59 cm) wide, when closed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">12. Mouth openers/mouth gags. Required mouth openers and mouth gags are used to open sea turtle mouths, and to keep them open when removing internal hooks from boated turtles. They must allow access to the hook or line without causing further injury to the turtle. Design standards are included in the item descriptions. At least two of the seven different types of mouth openers/gags described below are required:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A block of hard wood. Placed in the corner of the jaw, a block of hard wood may be used to gag open a turtle's mouth. A smooth block of hard wood of a type that does not splinter (e.g. maple) with rounded edges should be sanded smooth, if necessary, and soaked in water to soften the wood. The dimensions should be approximately 11 inches (27.94 cm) by 1 inch (2.54 cm) by 1 inch (2.54 cm). A long-handled, wire shoe brush with a wooden handle, and with the wires removed, is an inexpensive, effective and practical mouth-opening device that meets these requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A set of three canine mouth gags. Canine mouth gags are highly recommended to hold a turtle's mouth open, because the gag locks into an open position to allow for hands-free operation after it is in place. These tools are only for use on small and medium sized turtles, as larger turtles may be able to crush the mouth gag. A set of canine mouth gags must include one of each of the following sizes: Small (5 inches) (12.7 cm), medium (6 inches) (15.24 cm), and large (7 inches) (17.78 cm). They must be constructed of stainless steel. The ends must be covered with clear vinyl tubing, friction tape, or similar, to pad the surface.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A set of two sturdy dog chew bones. Placed in the corner of a turtle's jaw, canine chew bones are used to gag open a sea turtle's mouth. Required canine chews must be constructed of durable nylon, zylene resin, or thermoplastic polymer, and strong enough to withstand biting without splintering. To accommodate a variety of turtle beak sizes, a set must include one large (5\1/2\-8 inches (13.97 cm-20.32 cm) in length), and one small (3\1/2\-4\1/2\ inches (8.89 cm-11.43 cm) in length) canine chew bones.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A set of two rope loops covered with protective tubing. A set of two pieces of poly braid rope covered with light duty garden hose or similar flexible tubing each tied or spliced into a loop to provide a one-handed method for keeping the turtle's mouth open during hook and/or line removal. A required set consists of two 3-ft (0.91 m) lengths of poly braid rope (\3/8\-inch (9.52 mm) diameter suggested), each covered with an 8-inch (20.32 cm) section of \1/2\ inch (1.27 cm) or \3/4\ inch (1.91 cm) tubing, and each tied into a loop. The upper loop of rope covered with hose is secured on the upper beak to give control with one hand, and the second piece of rope covered with hose is secured on the lower beak to give control with the user's foot.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A hank of rope. Placed in the corner of a turtle's jaw, a hank of rope can be used to gag open a sea turtle's mouth. A 6-ft (1.83 m) lanyard of approximately \3/16\-inch (4.76 mm) braided nylon rope may be folded to create a hank, or looped bundle, of rope. Any size soft-braided nylon rope is allowed, however it must create a hank of approximately 2-4 inches (5.08 cm-10.16 cm) in thickness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> A set of four PVC splice couplings. PVC splice couplings can be positioned inside a turtle's mouth to allow access to the back of the mouth for hook and line removal. They are to be held in place with the needle-nose pliers. To ensure proper fit and access, a required set must consist of the following Schedule 40 PVC splice coupling sizes: 1 inch (2.54 cm), 1\1/4\ inch (3.18 cm), 1\1/2\ inch (3.81 cm), and 2 inches (5.08 cm).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> A large avian oral speculum. A large avian oral speculum provides the ability to hold a turtle's mouth open and to control the head with one hand, while removing a hook with the other hand. The avian oral speculum must be 9-inches (22.86 cm) long, and constructed of \3/16\-inch (4.76 mm) wire diameter surgical stainless steel (Type 304). It must be covered with 8 inches (20.32 cm) of clear vinyl tubing (\5/16\-inch (7.9 mm) outside diameter, \3/16\-inch (4.76 mm) inside diameter), friction tape, or similar to pad the surface.</p><p class="depth0">B. Sea turtle handling and release requirements. Sea turtle bycatch mitigation gear, as specified in paragraphs A.1. through 4. of this Appendix F, must be used to disengage any hooked or entangled sea turtles that cannot be brought onboard. Sea turtle bycatch mitigation gear, as specified in paragraphs A.5. through 12. of this Appendix F, must be used to facilitate access, safe handling, disentanglement, and hook removal or hook cutting of sea turtles that can be brought onboard, where feasible. Sea turtles must be handled, and bycatch mitigation gear must be used, in accordance with the careful release protocols and handling/release guidelines provided by NMFS and in accordance with the onboard handling and resuscitation requirements specified in Sec. 223.206(d)(1)of this title.</p><p class="depth0">1. Boated turtles. When practicable, active and comatose sea turtles must be brought on board, with a minimum of injury, using a dipnet as specified in paragraph A.5. of this Appendix F. All turtles less than 3 ft (.91 m) carapace length should be boated, if sea conditions permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A boated turtle should be placed on a cushioned/support device, as specified in paragraph A.6. of this Appendix F, in an upright orientation to immobilize it and facilitate gear removal. Then, it should be determined if the hook can be removed without causing further injury. All externally embedded hooks should be removed, unless hook removal would result in further injury to the turtle. No attempt to remove a hook should be made if it has been swallowed and the insertion point is not visible, or if it is determined that removal would result in further injury. If a hook cannot be removed, as much line as possible should be removed from the turtle using monofilament cutters as specified in paragraph A.11. of this Appendix F, and the hook should be cut as close as possible to the insertion point before releasing the turtle, using bolt cutters as specified in paragraph A.10. of this Appendix F. If a hook can be removed, an effective technique may be to cut off either the barb, or the eye, of the hook using bolt cutters, and then to slide the hook out. When the hook is visible in the front of the mouth, a mouth-opener, as specified in paragraph A.12. of this Appendix F, may facilitate opening the turtle's mouth and a gag may facilitate keeping the mouth open. Short-handled dehookers for internal hooks, or long-nose or needle-nose pliers, as specified in paragraphs A.7. and A.8. of this Appendix F, respectively, should be used to remove visible hooks from the mouth that have not been swallowed on boated turtles, as appropriate. As much gear as possible must be removed from the turtle without causing further injury prior to its release. Refer to the careful release protocols and handling/release guidelines required in Sec. 622.10(c)(1), and the handling and resuscitation requirements specified in Sec. 223.206(d)(1) of this title, for additional information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">2. Non-boated turtles. If a sea turtle is too large, or hooked in a manner that precludes safe boating without causing further damage or injury to the turtle, sea turtle bycatch mitigation gear specified in paragraphs A.1. through 4. of this Appendix F must be used to disentangle sea turtles from fishing gear and disengage any hooks, or to clip the line and remove as much line as possible from a hook that cannot be removed, prior to releasing the turtle, in accordance with the protocols specified in Sec. 622.10(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Non-boated turtles should be brought close to the boat and provided with time to

calm down. Then, it must be determined whether or not the hook can be removed without causing further injury. All externally embedded hooks must be removed, unless hook removal would result in further injury to the turtle. No attempt should be made to remove a hook if it has been swallowed, or if it is determined that removal would result in further injury. If the hook cannot be removed and/or if the animal is entangled, as much line as possible must be removed prior to release, using a line cutter as specified in paragraph A.1. of this Appendix F. If the hook can be removed, it must be removed using a long-handled dehooker as specified in paragraphs A.2. and A.3. of this Appendix F. Without causing further injury, as much gear as possible must be removed from the turtle prior to its release. Refer to the careful release protocols and handling/release guidelines required in Sec. 622.10(c)(1), and the handling and resuscitation requirements specified in Sec. 223.206(d)(1) for additional information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Appendix G to Part 622--Coastal Migratory Pelagics Zone Illustrations[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27JA15.000
