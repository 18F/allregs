                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To establish a national paroling policy, promote a more consistent exercise of discretion, and enable fairer and more equitable decision-making without removing individual case consideration, the U.S. Parole Commission has adopted guidelines for parole release consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> These guidelines indicate the customary range of time to be served before release for various combinations of offense (severity) and offender (parole prognosis) characteristics. The time ranges specified by the guidelines are established specifically for cases with good institutional adjustment and program progress.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> These time ranges are merely guidelines. Where the circumstances warrant, decisions outside of the guidelines (either above or below) may be rendered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The guidelines contain instructions for the rating of certain offense behaviors. However, especially mitigating or aggravating circumstances in a particular case may justify a decision or a severity rating different from that listed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> An evaluation sheet containing a ``salient factor score'' serves as an aid in determining the parole prognosis (potential risk of parole violation). However, where circumstances warrant, clinical evaluation of risk may override this predictive aid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Guidelines for reparole consideration are set forth at Sec.  2.21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The Commission shall review the guidelines, including the salient factor score, periodically and may revise or modify them at any time as deemed appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> If an offender was less than 18 years of age at the time of the current offense, such youthfulness shall, in itself, be considered as a mitigating factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For criminal behavior committed while in confinement see Sec.  2.36 (Rescission Guidelines).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)(1)</em> In probation revocation cases, the original federal offense behavior and any new criminal conduct on probation (federal or otherwise) is considered in assessing offense severity. The original federal conviction is also

counted in the salient factor score as a prior conviction. Credit is given toward the guidelines for any time spent in confinement on any offense considered in assessing offense severity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In probation revocation cases, the original federal offense behavior and any new criminal conduct on probation (federal or otherwise) is considered in assessing offense severity. The original federal conviction is also

counted in the salient factor score as a prior conviction. Credit is given toward the guidelines for any time spent in confinement on any offense considered in assessing offense severity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception: Where probation has been revoked on a complex sentence (i.e., a committed sentence of more than six months on one count or more of an indictment or information followed by a probation term on other count(s) of an indictment or information), the case shall be considered for guideline purposes under Sec.  2.21 as if parole rather than probation had been revoked.</p><p class="depth0">Guidelines for Decisionmaking[Guidelines for decisionmaking, customary total time to be served before</p><p class="depth0">release (including jail time)]------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Offender characteristics: Parole</p><p class="depth0">prognosis (salient factor score 1998)</p><p class="depth0">Offense characteristics:    -----------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Severity of offense behavior    Very good   Good (7   Fair (5   Poor (3</p><p class="depth0">(10 to 8)    to 6)     to 4)     to 0)------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Guideline range (months)</p><p class="depth0">Category:</p><p class="depth0">1...........................        <==4      <==8      8-12     12-16</p><p class="depth0">2...........................        <==6     <==10     12-16     16-22</p><p class="depth0">3...........................       <==10     12-16     18-24     24-32</p><p class="depth0">4...........................       12-18     20-26     26-34     34-44</p><p class="depth0">5...........................       24-36     36-48     48-60     60-72</p><p class="depth0">6...........................       40-52     52-64     64-78    78-100</p><p class="depth0">7...........................       52-80     64-92    78-110   100-148</p><p class="depth0">8 \1\.......................        100+      120+      150+     180+------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ Note: For Category Eight, no upper limits are specified due to the</p><p class="depth0">extreme variability of the cases within this category. For decisions</p><p class="depth0">exceeding the lower limit of the applicable guideline category by more</p><p class="depth0">than 48 months, the Commission will specify the pertinent case factors</p><p class="depth0">upon which it relied in reaching its decision, which may include the</p><p class="depth0">absence of any factors mitigating the offense. This procedure is</p><p class="depth0">intended to ensure that the prisoner understands that individualized</p><p class="depth0">consideration has been given to the facts of the case, and not to</p><p class="depth0">suggest that a grant of parole is to be presumed for any class of</p><p class="depth0">Category Eight offenders. However, a murder committed to silence a</p><p class="depth0">victim or witness, a contract murder, a murder by torture, the murder</p><p class="depth0">of a law enforcement officer to carry out an offense, or a murder</p><p class="depth0">committed to further the aims of an on-going criminal operation, shall</p><p class="depth0">not justify a grant of parole at any point in the prisoner's sentence</p><p class="depth0">unless there are compelling circumstances in mitigation (e.g., a</p><p class="depth0">youthful offender who participated in a murder planned and executed by</p><p class="depth0">his parent). Such aggravated crimes are considered, by definition, at</p><p class="depth0">the extreme high end of Category Eight offenses. For these cases, the</p><p class="depth0">expiration of the sentence is deemed to be a decision at the maximum</p><p class="depth0">limit of the guideline range. (The fact that an offense does not fall</p><p class="depth0">under the definition contained herein does not mean that the</p><p class="depth0">Commission is obliged to grant a parole.)</p><p class="depth0">U.S. Parole Commission Offense Behavior Severity Index

However, there are certain circumstances in which offenses committed at the same time are properly considered multiple separate offenses for the purpose of establishing the offense severity rating. These include (1) unrelated offenses, and (2) offenses involving the unlawful possession of weapons during commission of another offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For offenses graded according to monetary value (e.g., theft) and drug offenses, the severity rating is based on the amount or quantity involved and not on the number of separate instances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Intervening Arrests. Where offenses ordinarily graded by aggregation of value/quantity (e.g., property or drug offenses) are separated by an intervening arrest, grade (1) by aggregation of value/quantity or (2) as multiple separate offenses, whichever results in a higher severity category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Income Tax Violations Related to Other Criminal Activity. Where the circumstances indicate that the offender's income tax violations are related to failure to report income from other criminal activity (e.g., failure to report income from a fraud offense) grade as tax evasion or according to the underlying criminal activity established, whichever is higher. Do not grade as multiple separate offenses.</p><p class="depth0">3. In cases where multiple sentences have been imposed (whether consecutive or concurrent, and whether aggregated or not) an offense severity rating shall be established to reflect the overall severity of the underlying criminal behavior. This rating shall apply whether or not any of the component sentences have expired.</p><p class="depth0">4. The prisoner is to be held accountable for his own actions and actions done in concert with others; however, the prisoner is not to be held accountable for activities committed by associates over which the prisoner has no control and could not have been reasonably expected to foresee. However, if the prisoner has been convicted of a conspiracy, he must be held accountable for the criminal activities committed by his co-conspirators, provided such activities were committed in furtherance of the conspiracy and subsequent to the date the prisoner joined the conspiracy, except in the case of an independent, small-scale operator whose role in the conspiracy was neither established nor significant. An offender has an ``established'' role in a conspiracy if, for example, he takes orders to perform a function that assists others to further the objectives of the conspiracy, even if his activities did not significantly contribute to those objectives. For such offenders, however, a ``peripheral role'' reduction may be considered.</p><p class="depth0">5. The following are examples of circumstances that may be considered as aggravating factors: extreme cruelty or brutality to a victim; the degree of permanence or likely permanence of serious bodily injury resulting from the offender's conduct; an offender's conduct while attempting to evade arrest that causes circumstances creating a significant risk of harm to other persons (e.g., causing a high speed chase or provoking the legitimate firing of a weapon by law enforcement officers).</p><p class="depth0">6. The phrase ``may be considered an aggravating/mitigating factor'' is used in this index to provide guidance concerning certain circumstances which may warrant a decision above or below the guidelines. This does not restrict consideration of above or below guidelines decisions only to these circumstances, nor does it mean that a decision above or below the guidelines is mandated in every such case.</p><p class="depth0">Subchapter B--Definitions</p><p class="depth0">1. ``Accessory after the fact'' refers to the conduct of one who, knowing an offense has been committed, assists the offender to avoid apprehension, trial, or punishment (e.g., by assisting in disposal of the proceeds of an offense).</p><p class="depth0">Note: Where the conduct consists of concealing an offense by making false statements not under oath, grade as ``misprision of felony''. Where the conduct consists of haboring a fugitive, grade as ``harboring a fugitive''.</p><p class="depth0">2. ``Assassination kit'' refers to a disguised weapon designed to kill without attracting attention. Unlike other weapons such as sawed-off shotguns which can be used to intimidate, assassination kits are intended to be undetectable in order to make the victim and bystanders unaware of the threat. A typical assassination kit is usually, but not always, a firearm with a silencer concealed in a briefcase or similar disguise and fired without showing the weapon.</p><p class="depth0">3. ``Bodily injury'' refers to injury of a type normally requiring medical attention [e.g.,

broken bone(s), laceration(s) requiring stitches, severe bruises].</p><p class="depth0">4. ``Carnal knowledge'' refers to sexual intercourse with a female who is less than 16 years of age and is not the wife of the offender.</p><p class="depth0">5. ``Extortionate extension of credit'' refers to any extension of credit with respect to which it is the understanding of the creditor and the debtor at the time it is made that delay in making repayment or failure to make repayment could result in the use of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of any person.</p><p class="depth0">6. ``Failure to appear'' refers to the violation of court imposed conditions of release pending trial, appeal, or imposition or execution of sentence by failure to appear before the court or to surrender for service of sentence.</p><p class="depth0">7. ``Forcible felony'' includes, but shall not be limited to, kidnapping, rape or sodomy, aircraft piracy or interference with a flight crew, arson or property destruction offenses, escape, robbery, extortion, or criminal entry offenses, and attempts to commit such offenses.</p><p class="depth0">8. ``Involuntary manslaughter'' refers to the unlawful killing of a human being without malice in the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony, or in the commission in a unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection, of a lawful act which might produce death.</p><p class="depth0">9. ``Misprision of felony'' refers to the conduct of one who, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority. The ``concealment'' described above requires an act of commission (e.g., making a false statement to a law enforcement officer).</p><p class="depth0">10. ``Murder'' refers to the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. ``With malice aforethought'' generally refers to a finding that the offender formed an intent to kill or do serious bodily harm to the victim without just cause or provocation.</p><p class="depth0">11. ``Opiate'' includes heroin, morphine, opiate derivatives, and synthetic opiate substitutes.</p><p class="depth0">12. ``Other illicit drug offenses'' include, but are not limited to, offenses involving the following: amphetamines, hallucinogens, barbiturates, methamphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP).</p><p class="depth0">13. ``Other medium of exchange'' includes, but is not limited to, postage stamps, governmental money orders, or governmental coupons redeemable for cash or goods.</p><p class="depth0">14. ``Peripheral role'' in drug offenses refers to conduct such as that of a person hired as a deckhand on a marijuana boat, a person hired to help offload marijuana, a person with no special skills hired as a simple courier of drugs on a commercial airline flight, or a person hired as a chauffeur in a drug transaction. This definition does not include persons with decision-making or supervisory authority, persons with relevant special skills (e.g., a boat captain, chemist, or airplane pilot), or persons who finance such operations. Individuals who transport unusually large amounts of drugs (e.g., 50 kilos of cocaine or more) or who otherwise appear to have a high degree of trust, professionalism, or control will be considered to be ``transporters'' and not ``simple couriers.''</p><p class="depth0">15. ``Protected person'' refers to a person listed in 18 U.S.C. 351 (relating to Members of Congress), 1116 (relating to foreign officials, official guests, and internationally protected persons), or 1751 (relating to presidential assassination and officials in line of succession).</p><p class="depth0">16. ``Serious bodily injury'' refers to injury creating a substantial risk of death, major disability or loss of a bodily function, or disfigurement.</p><p class="depth0">17. ``Serious bodily injury is the result intended'' refers to a limited category of offense behaviors where the circumstances indicate that the bodily injury intended was serious (e.g., throwing acid in a person's face, or firing a weapon at a person) but where it is not established that murder was the intended object. Where the circumstances establish that murder was the intended object, grade as an `attempt to murder'.</p><p class="depth0">18. ``Sexual exploitation of children'' refers to employing, using, inducing, enticing, or coercing a person less than 18 years of age to engage in any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual or print medium depicting such conduct with knowledge or reason to know that such visual or print medium will be distributed for sale, transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or mailed. It also includes knowingly transporting, shipping, or receiving such visual or print medium for the purposes of distributing for sale, or knowingly distribution for sale such visual or print medium.</p><p class="depth0">19. ``Trafficking in stolen property'' refers to receiving stolen property with intent to sell.</p><p class="depth0">20. The ``value of the property'' is determined by estimating the actual or potential replacement cost to the victim. The ``actual replacement cost'' is the value or money permanently lost to the victim through theft/forgery/fraud. The ``potential replacement cost'' refers to the total loss the offender specifically intended to cause by theft/forgery/fraud, or the total amount of the victim's money or property unlawfully exposed to risk of loss through theft/forgery/fraud notwithstanding subsequent recovery by the victim. The highest of these three values is the value to be used in rating the offense on the guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">21. ``Voluntary manslaughter'' refers to the unlawful killing of a human being without malice upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.''</p><p class="depth0">SALIENT FACTOR SCORING MANUAL</p><p class="depth0">The following instructions serve as a guide in computing the salient factor score.
ITEM A. PRIOR CONVICTIONS/ADJUDICATIONS (ADULT OR JUVENILE) [[None = 3;</p><p class="depth0">One = 2; Two or three = 1; Four or more. . . . = 0]]</p><p class="depth0">A.1 In General.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Count all convictions/adjudications (adult or juvenile) for criminal offenses (other than the current offense) that were committed prior to the present period of confinement, except as specifically noted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Convictions for prior offenses that are not separated from each other by an intervening arrest (e.g., two burglaries followed by an arrest for both offenses) are counted as a single prior conviction. Prior offenses that are separated by an intervening arrest are counted separately (e.g., three convictions for larceny and a conviction for an additional larceny committed after the arrest for the first three larcenies would be counted as two prior convictions, even if all the four offenses were adjudicated together).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Do not count the current federal offense or state/local convictions resulting from the current federal offense ((i.e., offenses that are considered in assessing the severity of the current offense). Exception: Where the first and last overt acts of the current offense behavior are separated by an intervening federal conviction (e.g., after conviction for the current federal offense, the offender commits another federal offense while on appeal bond), both offenses are counted in assessing offense severity; the earlier offense is also counted as a prior conviction in the salient factor score.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Felony convictions are counted. Non-felony convictions are counted, except as listed under (b) and (c). Convictions for driving while intoxicated/while under the influence/while impaired, or leaving the scene of an accident involving injury or an attended vehicle are counted. For the purpose of scoring Item A of the salient factor score, use the offense of conviction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Convictions for the following offenses are counted only if the sentence resulting was a commitment of more than thirty days (as defined in item B) or probation of one year or more (as defined in Item E), or if the record indicates that the offense was classified by the jurisdiction as a felony (regardless of sentence):</p><p class="depth0">1. Contempt of court;</p><p class="depth0">2. Disorderly conduct/disorderly person/breach of the peace/disturbing the peace/uttering loud and abusive language;</p><p class="depth0">3. Driving without a license/with a revoked or suspended license/with a false license;</p><p class="depth0">4. False information to a police officer;</p><p class="depth0">5. Fish and game violations;</p><p class="depth0">6. Gambling (e.g., betting on dice, sports, cards) [Note: Operation or promotion of or employment in an unlawful gambling business is not included herein];</p><p class="depth0">7.

Leaving the scene of an accident (except as listed under (a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Convictions for certain minor offenses are not counted, regardless of sentence. These include:</p><p class="depth0">1. Hitchhiking;</p><p class="depth0">2. Local regulatory violations;</p><p class="depth0">3. Public intoxication/possession of alcohol by a minor/possession of alcohol in an open container;</p><p class="depth0">4. Traffic violations (except as specifically listed);</p><p class="depth0">5. Vagrancy/vagabond and rogue;</p><p class="depth0">6. Civil contempt.</p><p class="depth0">A.3 Juvenile Conduct. Count juvenile convictions/adjudications except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Do not count any status offense (e.g., runaway, truancy, habitual disobedience) unless the behavior included a criminal offense which would otherwise be counted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Do not count any criminal offense committed at age 15 or less, unless it resulted in a commitment of more than 30 days.</p><p class="depth0">A.4 Military Conduct. Count military convictions by general or special court-martial (not summary court-martial or Article 15 disciplinary proceeding) for acts that are generally prohibited by civilian criminal law (e.g., assault, theft). Do not count convictions for strictly military offenses. Note: This does not preclude consideration of serious or repeated military misconduct as a negative indicant of parole prognosis (i.e., a possible reason for overriding the salient factor score in relation to this item).</p><p class="depth0">A.5 Diversion. Conduct resulting in diversion from the judicial process without a finding of guilt (e.g., deferred prosecution, probation without plea, or a District of Columbia juvenile consent decree) is not to be counted in scoring this item. However, an instance of criminal behavior resulting in a judicial determination of guilt or an admission of guilt before a judicial body shall be counted as a conviction even if a conviction is not formally entered.</p><p class="depth0">A.6 Setting Aside of Convictions/Restoration of Civil Rights Setting aside or removal

of juvenile convictions/adjudications is normally for civil purposes (to remove civil penalties and stigma). Such convictions/adjudications are to be counted for purposes of assessing parole prognosis. This also applies to adult convictions/adjudications which may be set aside by various methods (including pardon). However, convictions/adjudications that were set aside or pardoned on grounds of innocence are not to be counted.</p><p class="depth0">A.7 Convictions Reversed or Vacated on Grounds of Constitutional or Procedural Error. Exclude any conviction reversed or vacated for constitutional or procedural grounds, unless the prisoner has been retried and reconvicted. It is the Commission's presumption that a conviction/adjudication is valid, except under the limited circumstances described in the first note below. If a prisoner challenges such conviction he/she should be advised to petition for a reversal of such conviction in the court in which he/she was originally tried, and then to provide the Commission with evidence of such reversal. Note: Occasionally the presentence report documents facts clearly indicating that a conviction was unconstitutional for deprivation of counsel [this occurs only when the conviction was for a felony, or for a lesser offense for which imprisonment was actually imposed; and the record is clear that the defendant (1) was indigent, and (2) was not provided counsel, and (3) did not waive counsel]. In such case, do not count the conviction. Similarly, do not count a conviction if: (1) the offender has petitioned the appropriate court to overturn a felony conviction that occurred prior to 1964, or a misdemeanor/petty offense conviction that occurred prior to 1973 (and the offender claims he served a jail sentence for the non-felony conviction); (2) the offender asserts he was denied his right to counsel in the prior conviction; and (3) the offender provides evidence (e.g., a letter from the court clerk) that the records of the prior conviction are unavailable. Note: If a conviction found to be invalid is nonetheless supported by persuasive information that the offender committed the criminal act, this information may be considered as a negative indicant of parole prognosis (i.e., a possible reason for overriding the salient factor score).</p><p class="depth0">A.8 Ancient Prior Record. If both of the following conditions are met: (1) The offender's only countable convictions under Item A occurred at least ten years prior to the commencement of the current offense behavior (the date of the last countable conviction under Item A refers to the date of the conviction, itself, not the date of the offense leading to conviction), and (2) there is at least a ten year commitment free period in the community (including time on probation or parole) between the last release from a countable commitment (under Item B) and the commencement of the current offense behavior; then convictions/commitments prior to the above ten year period are not to be counted for purposes of Item A, B, or C. Note: This provision does not preclude consideration of earlier behavior (e.g., repetition of particularly serious or assaultive conduct) as a negative indicant of parole prognosis (i.e., a possible reason for overriding the salient factor score). Similarly, a substantial crime free period in the community, not amounting to ten years, may, in light of other factors, indicate that the offender belongs in a better risk category than the salient factor score indicates.</p><p class="depth0">A.9 Foreign Convictions. Foreign convictions (for behavior that would be criminal in the United States) are counted.</p><p class="depth0">A.10 Tribal Court Convictions. Tribal court convictions are counted under the same terms and conditions as any other conviction.</p><p class="depth0">A.11 Forfeiture of Collateral. If the only known disposition is forfeiture of collateral, count as a conviction (if a conviction for such offense would otherwise be counted).</p><p class="depth0">A.12 Conditional/Unconditional Discharge (New York State). In N.Y. State, the term ``conditional discharge'' refers to a conviction with a suspended sentence and unsupervised probation; the term ``unconditional discharge'' refers to a conviction with a suspended sentence. Thus, such N.Y. State dispositions for countable offenses are counted as convictions.</p><p class="depth0">A.13 Adjudication Withheld (Florida). In Florida, the term ``adjudication withheld'' refers to a disposition in which a formal conviction is not entered at the time of sentencing, the purpose of which is to allow the defendant to retain his civil rights and not to be classified as a convicted felon. Since the disposition of adjudication withheld is characterized by an admission of guilt and/or a finding of guilt before a judicial body, dispositions of ``adjudication withheld'' are to be counted as convictions for salient factor scoring purposes. However, it is not considered a conviction on which forfeiture of street time can be based.</p><p class="depth0">A.14 Juvenile Consent Decree (District of Columbia). A juvenile consent decree in the District of Columbia is a diversionary disposition not requiring an admission or finding of guilt. Therefore, it is not to be used in scoring this item.
ITEM B. PRIOR COMMITMENTS OF MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS (ADULT OR JUVENILE)</p><p class="depth0">[[None=-2; One or two=1; Three or more=0]]</p><p class="depth0">B.1 Count all prior commitments of more than thirty days (adult or juvenile) resulting from a conviction/adjudication listed under Item A, except as noted below. Also count commitments of more than thirty days imposed upon revocation of probation or parole

where the original probation or parole resulted from a conviction/adjudication counted under Item A.</p><p class="depth0">B.2 Count only commitments that were imposed prior to the commission of the last overt act of the current offense behavior. Commitments imposed after the current offense are not counted for purposes of this item. Concurrent or consecutive sentences (whether imposed as the same time or at different times) that result in a continuous period of confinement count as a single commitment. However, a new court commitment of more than thirty days imposed for an escape/attempted escape or for criminal behavior committed while in confinement/escape status counts as a separate commitment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This item only includes commitments that were actually imposed. Do not count a suspended sentence as a commitment. Do not count confinement pending trial or sentencing or for study and observation as a commitment unless the sentence is specifically to ``time served''. If a sentence imposed is subsequently reconsidered and reduced, do not count as a commitment if it is determined that the total time served, including jail time, was 30 days or less. Count a sentence to intermittent confinement (e.g., weekends) totaling more than 30 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> This item includes confinement in adult or juvenile institutions, community corrections centers, and other residential treatment centers (e.g., halfway houses and community treatment centers). It does not include foster home placement. Count confinement in a community corrections center (CCC) or other residential treatment center only when it is part of a committed sentence. Do not count confinement in a community corrections center or other residential treatment center when imposed as a condition of probation or parole. Do not count self-commitment for drug or alcohol treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If a committed sentence of more than 30 days is imposed prior to the current offense but the offender avoids or delays service of the sentence (e.g., by absconding, escaping, bail pending appeal), count as a prior commitment. Note: Where the subject unlawfully avoids service of a prior commitment by escaping or failing to appear for service of sentence, this commitment is also to be considered in Items D and E. Example: An offender is sentenced to a three-year prison term, released on appeal bond, and commits the current offense. Count as a previous commitment under Item B, but not under Items D and E. To be considered under Items D and E, the avoidance of sentence must have been unlawful (e.g., escape or failure to report for service of sentence). Example: An offender is sentenced to a three-year prison term, escapes, and commits the current offense. Count as a previous commitment under Items B, D, and E.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> District of Columbia Juvenile Commitment to Department of Human Services. In the District of Columbia, juvenile offenders may be committed to the Department of Human Services for placement ranging from a foster home to a secure juvenile facility. Such a commitment is counted only if it can be established that the juvenile was actually committed for more than 30 days to a secure juvenile institution or residential treatment center rather than a foster home.
