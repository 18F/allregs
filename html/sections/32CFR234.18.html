A vehicle parked in any location without authorization, or parked contrary to the directions of posted signs or markings, shall be subject to removal at the owner's risk and expense, in addition to any penalties imposed.

This section may be supplemented from time to time with the approval of the Director, Washington Headquarters Services, or his designee, or the Installation Commander, by the issuance and posting of such parking directives as may be required, and when so issued and posted such directive shall have the same force and effect as if made a part hereof.</p>
