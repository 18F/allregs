The Regional Administrator may,  and upon request shall, also advise licensing and permitting agencies as  to the status of compliance by dischargers with the conditions and  requirements of applicable water quality standards. In cases where an  activity for which a license or permit is sought will affect water  quality, but for which there are no applicable water quality standards,  the Regional Administrator may advise licensing or permitting agencies  with respect to conditions of such license or permit to achieve  compliance with the purpose of the Act.</p>
