                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This section prescribes procedures and criteria applicable to  requests that the Administrator specify a new reference method, or a new  measurement principle and calibration procedure on which reference  methods shall be based, by revision of the appropriate appendix to part  50 of this chapter. Such action will ordinarily be taken only if the  Administrator determines that a candidate method or a variation thereof  is substantially superior to the existing reference method(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In exercising discretion under this section, the Administrator  will consider:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The benefits, in terms of the requirements and purposes of the  Act, that would result from specifying a new reference method or a new  measurement principle and calibration procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The potential economic consequences of such action for State and  local control agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any disruption of State and local air quality monitoring  programs that might result from such action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An applicant who wishes the Administrator to consider revising  an appendix to part 50 of this chapter on the ground that the  applicant's candidate method is substantially superior to the existing  reference method(s) shall submit an application for a reference or  equivalent method determination in accordance with Sec. 53.4 and shall  indicate therein that such consideration is desired. The application  shall include, in addition to the information required by Sec. 53.4,  data and any other information supporting the applicant's claim that the  candidate method is substantially superior to the existing reference  method(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> After receiving an application under paragraph (c) of this  section, the Administrator will publish notice of its receipt in the  Federal Register and, within 120 calendar days after receipt of the  application, take one of the following actions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determine that it is appropriate to propose a revision of the  appendix to part 50 of this chapter in question and send notice of the  determination to the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determine that it is inappropriate to propose a revision of the  appendix to part 50 of this chapter in question, determine whether the  candidate method is a reference or equivalent method, and send notice of  the determinations, including a statement of reasons for the  determination not to propose a revision, to the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Send notice to the applicant that additional information must be  submitted before a determination can be made and specify the additional  information that is needed (in such cases, the 120-day period shall  commence upon receipt of the additional information).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Send notice to the applicant that additional tests are  necessary, specifying what tests are necessary and how the test shall be  interpreted (in such cases, the 120-day period shall commence upon  receipt of the additional test data).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Send notice to the applicant that additional tests will be  conducted by the Administrator, specifying the nature of and reasons for  the additional tests and the estimated time required (in such cases, the  120-day period shall commence 1 calendar day after the additional tests  have been completed).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> After making a determination under paragraph (d)(1) of  this section, the Administrator will publish a notice of proposed  rulemaking in the Federal Register. The notice of proposed rulemaking  will indicate that the Administrator proposes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To revise the appendix to part 50 of this chapter in question.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Where the appendix specifies a measurement principle and  calibration procedure, to cancel reference method designations based on  the appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> To cancel equivalent method designations based on the existing  reference method(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The notice of proposed rulemaking will include the terms or  substance of the proposed revision, will indicate what period(s) of time  the Administrator proposes to allow for replacement of existing methods  under section 2.3 of appendix C to part 58 of this chapter, and will  solicit public comments on the proposal with particular reference to the  considerations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If, after consideration of comments received, the  Administrator determines that the appendix to part 50 in question should  be revised, the Administrator will, by publication in the Federal  Register:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Promulgate the proposed revision, with such modifications as may  be appropriate in view of comments received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Where the appendix to part 50 (prior to revision) specifies a  measurement principle and calibration procedure, cancel reference method  designations based on the appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Cancel equivalent method designations based on the existing  reference method(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Specify the period(s) that will be allowed for replacement of  existing methods under section 2.3 of appendix C to part 58 of this  chapter, with such modifications from the proposed period(s) as may be  appropriate in view of comments received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Canceled designations will be deleted from the list maintained  under Sec. 53.8(c). The requirements and procedures for cancellation set  forth in Sec. 53.11 shall be inapplicable to cancellation of reference  or equivalent method designations under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the appendix to part 50 of this chapter in question is  revised to specify a new measurement principle and calibration procedure  on which the applicant's candidate method is based, the Administrator  will take appropriate action under Sec. 53.5 to determine whether the  candidate method is a reference method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Upon taking action under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the  Administrator will send notice of the action to all applicants for whose  methods reference and equivalent method designations are canceled by  such action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> An applicant who has received notice of a determination under  paragraph (d)(2) of this section may appeal the determination by taking  one or more of the following actions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The applicant may submit new or additional information in  support of the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The applicant may request that the Administrator reconsider the  data and information already submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The applicant may request that any test conducted by the  Administrator that was a material factor in making the determination be  repeated.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
