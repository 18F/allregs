                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Replacement downconverters. The proponent(s) must install at every eligible EBS receive site a downconverter designed to minimize the reception of signals from outside the MBS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An EBS receive site is eligible to be replaced if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A reception system was installed at that site on or before the date the EBS licensee receives its Pre-Transition Data Request (see Sec. 27.1231(d));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The reception system was installed by or at the direction of the EBS licensee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The reception system receives EBS programming under Sec. 27.1203(b) and (c) or is located at a cable television system headend and the cable system relays educational or instructional programming for an EBS licensee; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> It is within the licensee's 35-mile radius GSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Replacement downconverters must meet the following minimum technical requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The downconverter's input frequency range (the ``in-band frequencies'') must be 2572 MHz to 2614 MHz and output frequency range must be 294 MHz to 336 MHz;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The downconversion process must not invert frequencies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The nominal gain of the downconverter must be 32 dB, or greater;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The downconverter must include filtering prior to the first amplifier that attenuates frequencies below 2500 MHz and above 2705 MHz by at least 25 dB;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The downconverter must have an out-of-band input 3rd order intercept point (input IP3) of at least + 9 dBm, where out-of-band is defined as all frequencies below 2566 MHz and all frequencies above 2620 MHz;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The downconverter must have a typical noise figure of no greater than 3.5 dB and a worst case noise figure of no greater than 4.5 dB across all in-band frequencies and across its entire intended operating temperature range;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The downconverter must not introduce a delta group delay of more than 20 nanoseconds for digital operations or 100 nanoseconds for analog

operations over any individual six megahertz MBS channel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Migration of Video Programming and Data Transmission Track. (1) The proponent(s) must provide, at its cost, to each EBS licensee that intends to continue downstream high-power, high-site educational video programming or data transmission services, with one programming track on the MBS channels for each EBS video or data transmission track the licensee is transmitting on a simultaneous basis before the transition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To be eligible for migration, a program track must contain EBS programming that complies with Sec. 27.1203 (b) and (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The proponent(s) must pay only the costs of migrating programming tracks being transmitted on December 31, 2002 or within six months prior thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The proponent(s) must migrate each eligible programming track to spectrum in the MBS that will be licensed to the affected licensee at the conclusion of the transition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> After the transition, the desired-to-undesired signal level ratio at each of the receive sites securing a replacement downconverter must satisfy the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cochannel D/U Ratio. (A) When the post-transition desired signal is transmitted using analog modulation, the actual cochannel D/U ratio measured at the output of the reception antenna must be at least the lesser of 45 dB or the actual pre-transmission D/U ratio less 1.5 dB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When the post-transition desired signal will be transmitted using digital modulation, the actual cochannel D/U ratio measured at the output of the reception antenna must be at least the lesser of 32 dB or the pre-transition D/U ratio less 1.5 dB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Where in implementing the Transition Plan, the proponent(s) deploys precise frequency offset in an analog system, the minimum cochannel D/U ratio is reduced to 38 dB, provided that the transmitters have or are upgraded pursuant to the Transition Plan to have the appropriate ``plus,'' ``zero,'' or ``minus'' 10,010 Hertz precision frequency offset with a 3 Hertz (or better) stability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adjacent Channel D/U Ratio. The actual adjacent channel D/U must equal or exceed the lesser of 0 dB or the actual pre-transmission D/U ratio. However, in the event that the receive site uses receivers or is upgraded by the proponent(s) as part of the Transition Plan to use receivers that can tolerate negative adjacent channel D/U ratios, the actual adjacent channel D/U ratio at such receive site must equal or exceed -10 dB. Provided that the receive site receiver is not upgraded and cannot tolerate -10 dB, the adjacent channel D/U ratio would be 0dB.
