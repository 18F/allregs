The borrower must provide any documentation required to support the farm operating plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The borrower must not be in non-monetary default.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The borrower must not be ineligible due to disqualification resulting from Federal crop insurance violation according to 7 CFR part 718.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The borrower must not become 165 days past due before the appropriate Agency DSA documents are executed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Loan eligibility. (1) Any FLP loan to be considered for DSA must have been outstanding at the time the natural disaster occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All of the borrower's program and non-program loans must be current after the Agency completes a DSA of the scheduled installment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All FLP loans must be current or less than 90 days past due at the time the application for DSA is complete.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Agency has not accelerated or applied any special servicing action under this part to the loan since the natural disaster occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For any loan that will receive a DSA, the remaining term of the loan must equal or exceed 2 years from the due date of the installment set-aside.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The loan must not have a DSA in place.</p>
