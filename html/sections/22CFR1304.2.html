                            <p class="depth0">Agency has the meaning set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(f)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Commercial use requester means a requester seeking information for a  use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests  of himself or the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can  include furthering those interests through litigation. In determining  whether a request properly belongs in this category, the FOIA Officer  shall determine the use to which the requester will put the documents  requested. Where the FOIA Officer has reasonable cause to doubt the use  to which the requester will put the records sought, or where that use is  not clear from the request itself, the FOIA Officer shall contact the  requester for additional clarification before assigning the request to a  specific category.</p><p class="depth0">Confidential commercial information means records provided to the  government by a submitter that arguably contains material exempt from  disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, because disclosure could  reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.</p><p class="depth0">Direct costs mean those expenditures by MCC actually incurred in  searching for and duplicating records in response to the FOIA request.  These costs include the salary of the employee(s) performing the work  (basic rate of pay plus a percentage of that rate to cover benefits) and  the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Direct costs do not include  overhead expenses, such as the cost of space, heating, or lighting of  the facility in which the records are stored.</p><p class="depth0">Duplication means the process of making a copy of a record in order  to respond to a FOIA request, including paper copies, microfilm, audio- video materials, and computer diskettes or other electronic copies.</p><p class="depth0">Educational institution refers to a preschool, a public or private  elementary or secondary school, an institute of undergraduate higher  education, an institute of graduate higher education, an institute of  professional education, or an institute of vocational education which  operates a program of scholarly research. To qualify for this category,  the requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made  under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are  not sought for a commercial use, but are sought to further scholarly  research.</p><p class="depth0">FOIA means the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C.  552).</p><p class="depth0">FOIA Officer means the MCC employee who is authorized to make  determinations as provided in this part. The mailing address for the  FOIA Officer is: Millennium Challenge Corporation, Attn: FOIA Officer,  875 Fifteenth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005.</p><p class="depth0">Non-commercial scientific institution refers to an institution that  is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is used in  paragraph (a) of this section, and which is operated solely for the  purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not  intended to promote any particular product or industry. To qualify for  this category, the requester must show that the request is authorized by  and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the  records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought to further  scholarly research.</p><p class="depth0">Record means information or documentary material MCC maintains in  any form or format, including an electronic form or format, which MCC:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Made or received under federal law or in connection with the  transaction of public business;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Preserved or determined is appropriate for preservation as  evidence of MCC operations or activities or because of the value of the  information it contains; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Controls at the time it receives a request.</p><p class="depth0">Representative of the news media means any person actively gathering  news for an entity that is organized   and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term  ``news'' means information that is about current events or that would be  of current interest to the public. For a ``freelance journalist'' to be  regarded as working for a news organization, the requester must  demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that  organization, such as a publication contract. Absent such showing, the  requester may provide documentation establishing the requester's past  publication record. To qualify for this category, the requester must not  be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a  request for records supporting a news-dissemination function shall not  be considered to be for a commercial use.</p><p class="depth0">Requester means any person, including an individual, corporation,  firm, organization, or other entity, who makes a request to MCC under  FOIA for records.</p><p class="depth0">Review means the process of examining a record to determine whether  all or part of the record may be withheld, and includes redacting or  otherwise processing the record for disclosure to a requester. It does  not include time spent:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Resolving legal or policy issues regarding the application of  exemptions to a record; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> At the administrative appeal level, unless MCC determines that  the exemption under which it withheld records does not apply and the  records are reviewed again to determine whether a different exemption  may apply.</p><p class="depth2">Search means the time spent locating records responsive to a  request, manually or by electronic means, including page-by-page or  line-by-line identification of responsive material within a record.</p><p class="depth2">Submitter means any person or entity which provides information  directly or indirectly to MCC. The term includes, but is not limited to,  corporations, state governments and foreign governments.</p><p class="depth2">Working day means a Federal workday that does not include Saturdays,  Sundays, or Federal holidays.</p>
