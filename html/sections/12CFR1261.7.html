                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Election announcement. (1) Within a reasonable time in advance  of an election, a Bank shall notify each member in its district of the  commencement of the election process. Such notice shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of member directorships designated for each voting  state in the Bank district and the number of independent directorships  for the Bank;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name of each incumbent Bank director, the name and location  of the member at which each member director serves, and the name and  location of the organization with which each independent director is  affiliated, if any, and the expiration date of each Bank director's term  of office;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A brief statement describing the skills and experience the Bank  believes are most likely to add strength to the board of directors,  provided that the Bank previously has conducted the annual assessment  permitted by Sec. 1261.9 and the Bank has elected to provide the  results of the assessment to the members;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An attachment indicating the name, location, and FHFA ID number  of every member in the member's voting state, and the number of votes  each such member may cast for each directorship to be filled by such  members, as determined in accordance with Sec. 1261.6; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a member directorship is to be filled by members in a State,  a nominating certificate for those members.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Member directorship nominations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any member that is entitled  to vote in the election may nominate an eligible individual to fill each  available member directorship for its voting state by delivering to its  Bank, prior to a deadline to be established by the   Bank and set forth in the notice required in paragraph (a) of this  section, a nominating certificate duly adopted by the member's governing  body or by an individual authorized by the member's governing body to  act on its behalf.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nominating certificate shall include the name of the nominee  and the name, location, and FHFA ID number of the member the nominee  serves as an officer or director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Bank shall establish a deadline for delivery of nominating  certificates, which shall be no earlier than 30 calendar days after the  date on which the Bank delivers the notice required by paragraph (a) of  this section, and the Bank shall not accept certificates received after  that deadline. The Bank shall retain all accepted nominating  certificates for at least two years after the date of the election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Accepting member directorship nominations. Promptly after  receipt of any nominating certificate, a Bank shall notify in writing  any individual nominated for a member directorship. An individual may  accept the nomination only by delivering to the Bank, prior to a  deadline established by the Bank and set forth in its notice, an  executed director eligibility certification form prescribed by FHFA. A  Bank shall allow each nominee at least 30 calendar days after the date  the Bank delivered the notice of nomination within which to deliver the  executed form. A nominee may decline the nomination by so advising the  Bank in writing, or by failing to deliver a properly executed director  eligibility certification form prior to the deadline. Each Bank shall  retain all information received under this paragraph for at least two  years after the date of the election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Independent directorship nominations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any individual who  seeks to be an independent director of the board of directors of a Bank  may deliver to the Bank, on or before the deadline set by the Bank for  delivery of nominating certificates, an executed independent director  application form prescribed by FHFA that demonstrates that the  individual both is eligible and has either of the following  qualifications:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> More than four years experience representing consumer or  community interests in banking services, credit needs, housing, or  consumer financial protections; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Knowledge of or experience in one or more of the areas set  forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any other interested party may recommend to the Bank that it  consider a particular individual as a nominee for an independent  directorship, but the Bank shall not nominate any individual unless the  individual has delivered to the Bank, on or before the date the Bank has  set for delivery of nominating certificates, an executed independent  director application form prescribed by FHFA. The application form  prescribed by FHFA will provide a means by which an individual can  indicate an intent to be considered for a public interest directorship.  The board of directors of the Bank may consider any individual for any  independent directorship nomination, provided it has determined that the  individual is eligible and qualified, but the board shall nominate for a  public interest directorship only an individual who indicates on the  application form a desire to be considered for a public interest  directorship. The board of directors of the Bank shall consult with the  Bank's Advisory Council before nominating any individual for any  independent directorship. Each Bank shall include in its bylaws the  procedures it intends to use for the nomination and election of the  independent directors, and shall retain all information received under  this paragraph for at least two years after the date of the election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each Bank shall determine the number of public interest  directorships to be included among its authorized independent  directorships, provided that each Bank shall at all times have at least  two such directorships, and shall announce that number to its members in  the notice required by paragraph (a) of this section. In submitting  nominations to its members, each Bank shall nominate at least as many  individuals as there are independent directorships to be filled in that  year's election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Independent director qualifications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each independent  director and each   nominee for an independent directorship, other than a public interest  directorship, shall have experience in, or knowledge of, one or more of  the following areas: auditing and accounting, derivatives, financial  management, organizational management, project development, risk  management practices, and the law. Before nominating any individual for  an independent directorship, other than a public interest directorship,  the board of directors of a Bank shall determine that such knowledge or  experience of the nominee is commensurate with that needed to oversee a  financial institution with a size and complexity that is comparable to  that of the Bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each public interest independent director and each nominee for a  public interest directorship shall have more than four years experience  representing consumer or community interests in banking services, credit  needs, housing or consumer financial protection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Eligibility verification. Using the information provided on  member director eligibility forms prescribed by FHFA, each Bank shall  verify that each nominee for each member directorship meets all the  eligibility requirements for such directorship. Using the information  provided on independent director application forms prescribed by FHFA,  each Bank shall verify that each nominee for each public interest  independent directorship and each other independent directorship meets  all eligibility requirements and any knowledge or experience  qualifications for such directorship, as set forth in the Bank Act and  this subpart. Before announcing any independent director nominee, the  Bank shall deliver to FHFA, for the Director's review, a copy of the  independent director application forms executed by the individuals  nominated for independent directorships. If within two weeks of such  delivery FHFA provides comments to the Bank on any independent director  nominee, the board of directors of the Bank shall consider the FHFA's  comments in determining whether to proceed with those nominees or to  reopen the nomination.
