A reporting party shall  report any publicly reportable swap transaction to a registered swap  data repository as soon as technologically practicable after such  publicly reportable swap transaction is executed. For purposes of this  part, a registered swap data repository includes any swap data  repository provisionally registered with the Commission pursuant to part  49 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a registered swap  execution facility or designated contract market. A party to a publicly  reportable swap transaction shall satisfy its reporting requirement  under this section by executing a publicly reportable swap transaction  on or pursuant to the rules of a registered swap execution facility or  designated contract market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Off-facility swaps. All off-facility swaps shall be reported by  the reporting party as soon as technologically practicable following  execution, to a registered swap data repository for the appropriate  asset class in accordance with the rules set forth in this part. Unless  otherwise agreed to by the parties prior to the execution of the  publicly reportable swap transaction, the following persons shall be  reporting parties for off-facility swaps:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If only one party is a swap dealer or major swap participant,  then the swap dealer or major swap participant shall be the reporting  party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If one party is a swap dealer and the other party is a major  swap participant, then the swap dealer shall be the reporting party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If both parties are swap dealers, then the swap dealers shall  designate which party shall be the reporting party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If both parties are major swap participants, then the major  swap participants shall designate which party shall be the reporting  party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If neither party is a swap dealer or a major swap participant,  then the parties shall designate which party (or its agent) shall be the  reporting party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Publicly reportable swap transactions executed on or pursuant to the  rules of a registered swap execution facility or designated contract  market. A registered swap execution facility or designated contract  market shall satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph by  transmitting swap transaction and pricing data to a registered swap data  repository, as soon as technologically practicable after the publicly  reportable swap transaction has been executed on or pursuant to the  rules of such trading platform or facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data by  registered swap data repositories. A registered swap data repository  shall ensure that swap transaction and pricing data is publicly  disseminated, as soon as technologically practicable after such data is  received from a registered swap execution facility, designated contract  market or reporting party, unless such publicly reportable swap  transaction is subject to a time delay described in Sec. 43.5 of this  part, in which case the publicly reportable swap transaction shall be  publicly disseminated in the manner described in Sec. 43.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prohibitions on disclosure of data. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If there is a registered  swap data repository for an asset class, a registered swap execution  facility or designated contract market shall not disclose swap  transaction and pricing data relating to publicly reportable swap  transactions in such asset class, prior to the public dissemination of  such data by a registered swap data repository unless:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Such disclosure is made no earlier than the transmittal of such  data to a registered swap data repository for public dissemination;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Such disclosure is only made to market participants on such  registered swap execution facility or designated contract market;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Market participants are provided advance notice of such  disclosure; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Any such disclosure by the registered swap execution facility or  designated contract market is non-discriminatory.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If there is a registered swap data repository for an asset  class, a swap dealer or major swap participant shall not disclose swap  transaction and pricing data relating to publicly reportable swap  transactions in such asset class, prior to the public dissemination of  such data by a registered swap data repository unless:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Such disclosure is made no earlier than the transmittal of such  data to a registered swap data repository for public dissemination;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Such disclosure is only made to the customer base of such swap  dealer or major swap participant, including parties who maintain  accounts with or have been swap counterparties with such swap dealer or  major swap participant;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Swap counterparties are provided advance notice of such  disclosure; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Any such disclosure by the swap dealer or major swap participant  is non-discriminatory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements for registered swap data repositories in providing  the public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data in real- time--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliance with 17 CFR part 49. Any registered swap data  repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and  pricing data in real-time shall comply with part 49 of this chapter and  shall publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in  accordance with this part as soon as technologically practicable upon  receipt of such data, except as otherwise provided in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acceptance and public dissemination of all swaps in an asset  class.

Reporting parties,  registered swap execution facilities, designated contract markets and  registered swap data repositories shall not submit or agree to submit a  cancellation or correction for the purpose of re-reporting swap  transaction and pricing data in order to gain or extend a delay in  public dissemination of accurate swap transaction or pricing data or to  otherwise evade the reporting requirements in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cancellation. A registered swap data repository shall cancel any  incorrect data that had been publicly disseminated by publicly  disseminating a cancellation of such data, as soon as technologically  practicable, in the manner described in appendix A to this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Correction. A registered swap data repository shall correct any  incorrect data that had been publicly disseminated by publicly  disseminating a cancellation of the incorrect swap transaction and  pricing data and then publicly disseminating the correct data, as soon  as technologically practicable, in the manner described in appendix A to  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Hours of operation of registered swap data repositories. Unless  otherwise provided in this subsection, a registered swap data repository  shall have systems in place to continuously receive and publicly  disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in real-time pursuant to  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A registered swap data repository may declare closing hours to  perform system maintenance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A registered swap data repository shall, to the extent  reasonably possible, avoid scheduling closing hours when, in its  estimation, the U.S. market and major foreign markets are most active.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A registered swap data repository shall comply with the  requirements under part 40 of this chapter in setting closing hours and  shall provide advance notice of its closing hours to market participants  and the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Acceptance of data during closing hours.
