                            <p class="depth0">An agency must meet the following requirements before it transfers  records to a records storage facility:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ensure that the requirements of 36 CFR part 1234 are met.  Special attention must be paid to ensuring appropriate storage  conditions for records on non-paper based media (e.g., film, audio tape,  magnetic tape), especially those that are scheduled for long-term or  permanent retention, as those records typically require more stringent  environmental controls (see 36 CFR parts 1236 and 1237).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To transfer unscheduled records, notify the National Archives  and Records Administration, Modern Records Programs (NWM), 8601 Adelphi  Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, phone number (301) 837-1738, in  writing prior to the transfer. The notification   must identify the records storage facility and include a copy of the  information required by Sec. 1232.16(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For all records being transferred, create documentation  sufficient to identify and locate files. (See Sec. 1232.16.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ensure that NARA-approved retention periods are implemented  properly and that records documenting final disposition actions  (destruction or transfer to the National Archives of the United States)  are created and maintained.</p>
