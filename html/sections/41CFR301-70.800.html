                            <p class="depth0">You may authorize Federal travelers, non-Federal travelers, and any  other passengers, as defined in part 300-3 of this subtitle, to travel  on Government aircraft, subject to the rules in this subpart. Because  the taxpayers generally should pay no more than necessary for  transportation of travelers, except for required use travel, you may  authorize travel on Government aircraft only when a Government aircraft  is the most cost-effective mode of travel and the traveler is traveling  for Governmental purposes.</p>
