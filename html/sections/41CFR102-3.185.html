                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 15 requirements. An agency may not use any advice or  recommendation provided to an agency by the National Academy of Sciences  (NAS) or the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) under an  agreement between the agency and an academy, if such advice or  recommendation was developed by use of a committee created by either  academy, unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The committee was not subject to any actual management or  control by an agency or officer of the Federal Government; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of NAS, the academy certifies that it has complied  substantially with the requirements of section 15(b) of the Act; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of NAPA, the academy certifies that it has complied  substantially with the requirements of sections 15(b) (1), (2), and (5)  of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No agency management or control. Agencies must not manage or  control the specific procedures adopted by each academy to comply with  the requirements of section 15 of the Act that are applicable to that  academy. In addition, however, any committee created and used by an  academy in the development of any advice or recommendation to be  provided by the academy to an agency must be subject to both actual  management and control by that academy and not by the agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Funding agreements. Agencies may enter into contracts, grants,  and cooperative agreements with NAS or NAPA that are consistent with the  requirements of this subpart to obtain advice or recommendations from  such academy. These funding agreements require, and agencies may rely  upon, a written certification by an authorized representative of the  academy provided to the agency upon delivery to the agency of each  report containing advice or recommendations required under the agreement  that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The academy has adopted policies and procedures that comply with  the applicable requirements of section 15 of the Act; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To the best of the authorized representative's knowledge and  belief, these policies and procedures substantially have been complied  with in performing the work required under the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
