                                Sec. 1.591-1  Deduction for dividends paid on deposits.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. (1) In the case of a taxpayer described in paragraph  (c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable, there are  allowed as deductions from gross income amounts which during the taxable  year are paid to, or credited to the accounts of, depositors or holders  of accounts as dividends or interest on their deposits or withdrawable  accounts, if such amounts paid or credited are withdrawable on demand  subject only to customary notice of intention to withdraw.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The deduction provided in section 591 is applicable to the  taxable year in which amounts credited as dividends or interest become  withdrawable by the depositor or holder of an account subject only to  customary notice of intention to withdraw. Thus, amounts which, as of  the last day of the taxable year, are credited as dividends or interest,  but which are not withdrawable by depositors or holders of accounts  until the following business day, are deductible under section 591 in  the year subsequent to the taxable year in which they were so credited.  A deduction under this section will not be denied by reason of the fact  that the amounts credited as dividends or interest, otherwise deductible  under section 591, are subject to the terms of a pledge agreement  between the taxpayer and the depositor or holder of an account. In the  case of a domestic building and loan association having nonwithdrawable  capital stock represented by shares, no deduction is allowable under  this section for amounts paid or credited as dividends on such shares.  In the case of a taxable year ending after December 31, 1962, for  special rules governing the treatment of dividends or interest paid or  credited for periods representing more than 12 months, see section  461(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Serial associations, bonus plans, etc. If a taxpayer described  in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable,  operates in whole or in part as a serial association, maintains a bonus  plan, or issues shares, or accepts deposits, subject to fines,  penalties,   forfeitures, or other withdrawal fees, it may deduct under section 591  the total amount credited as dividends or interest upon such shares or  deposits, credited to a bonus account for such shares or deposits, or  allocated to a series of shares for the taxable year, notwithstanding  that as a customary condition of withdrawal:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amounts invested in, and earnings credited to, series shares  must be withdrawn in multiples of even shares, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>  of this paragraph is exercised, there is includible in the gross income  of such taxpayer for such taxable year amounts retained or recovered by  the taxpayer pursuant to the exercise of such right. If the provisions  of paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.163-4 (relating to deductions for original  issue discount) apply to deposits made with respect to a certificate of  deposit, time deposit, bonus plan or other deposit arrangement, the  provisions of this paragraph shall not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective date. The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  section shall apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dividends or interest paid or credited after October 16, 1962,  by any taxpayer which (at the time of such payment or credit) qualifies  as (i) a mutual savings bank not having capital stock represented by  shares, (ii) a domestic building and loan association (as defined in  section 7701(a)(19)), (iii) a cooperative bank (as defined in section  7701(a)(32)), or (iv) any other savings institution chartered and  supervised as a savings and loan or similar association under Federal or  State law; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dividends paid or credited before October 17, 1962, by any  taxpayer which (at the time of such payment or credit) qualifies as (i)  a mutual savings bank not having capital stock represented by shares,  (ii) a cooperative bank without capital stock organized and operated for  mutual purposes and without profit, or (iii) a domestic building and  loan association (as defined in section 7701(a)(19) before amendment by  section 6(c) of the Revenue Act of 1962 (76 Stat. 982)).  [T.D. 6728, 29 FR 5855, May 5, 1964, as amended by T.D. 7154, 36 FR  24997, Dec. 28, 1971]</p>
