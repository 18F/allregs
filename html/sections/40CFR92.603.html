Where a manufacturer holds certificates of  conformity for both freshly manufactured and remanufactured locomotive  engine families, the Administrator may require the manufacturer to test  one freshly manufactured engine family and one remanufactured engine  family. The Administrator may require a manufacturer or remanufacturer  to test additional engine families if he/she has reason to believe that  locomotives in an engine family do not comply with emission standards in  use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For engine families of less than 10 locomotives per year, no in- use testing will be required, unless the Administrator has reason to  believe that those engine families are not complying with the applicable  emission standards in use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Locomotive manufacturers or remanufacturers shall perform  emission testing of a sample of in-use locomotives from an engine  family, as specified in Sec. 92.605. Manufacturers or remanufacturers  shall submit data from this in-use testing to EPA. EPA will use these  data, and any other data available to EPA, to determine the compliance  status of classes of locomotives, including for purposes of subpart H of  this part, and whether remedial action is appropriate.</p>
