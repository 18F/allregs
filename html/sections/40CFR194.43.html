measures that will be employed to preserve knowledge about the location, design, and contents of the disposal system.

Such credit, or a smaller credit as determined by the Administrator, cannot be used for more than several hundred years and may decrease over time. In no case, however, shall passive institutional controls be assumed to eliminate the likelihood of human intrusion entirely.</p>
