                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Samples used in testing must be selected in accordance with Sec. 160.076-29(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On each sample selected--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer must conduct the tests in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(8) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The recognized laboratory inspector must conduct or supervise the tests in paragraphs (c)(4) through (c)(8) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In addition to meeting the requirements of this section, each test result must meet the requirements, if any, contained in the approved plans and specifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When conducting the tests specified by this paragraph, the following conditions must be met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inflation chamber materials. The materials in each inflatable chamber must comply with the requirements in Table 29.1 of UL 1191 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.076-11) for permeability, grab strength, and tear strength. Lots not meeting this requirement must be rejected and, unless authorized by the Commandant, may not be subdivided and retested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Seam strength. The seams in each inflation chamber of each sample must be tested in accordance with Table 29.1 of UL 1191.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Over-pressure. Each sample must be tested in accordance with and meet UL 1180 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.076-11) section 41. Prior to initiating the test at the specified values, samples may be prestressed by inflating them to a greater pressure than the required test pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Air retention. Each sample must be tested in accordance with and meet UL 1180 section 42. Prior to initiating the test at the specified values, test samples may be prestressed by inflating to a pressure greater than the design pressure, but not exceeding 50 percent of the required pressure for the tests in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. No alternate test method may be used that decreases the length of the test unless authorized by the Commandant. Such alternative test must require a proportionately lower allowable pressure loss and the same percentage sensitivity and accuracy as the standard allowable loss measured with the standard instrumentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Buoyancy and inflation medium retention. Each sample must be tested in

accordance with and meet UL 1180 section 29. Each buoyancy value must fall within the tolerances specified in the approved plans and specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Tensile strength. Each sample primary closure system must be tested in accordance with and meet UL 1180 section 31.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Detailed product examination. Each sample PFD must be disassembled to the extent necessary to determine compliance with the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All dimensions and seam allowances must be within tolerances prescribed in the approved plans and specifications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The torque of each screw type mechanical fastener must be within its tolerance as prescribed in the approved plans and specifications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The arrangement, markings, and workmanship must be as specified in the approved plans and specifications and this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The PFD must not contain any apparent defects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Waterproof Marking Test. Each sample must be completely submerged in fresh water for at least 30 minutes. The sample must then be removed, immediately placed on a hard surface, and the markings vigorously rubbed with the fingers for 15 seconds. If the printing becomes illegible, the sample must be rejected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Final lot examination and inspection--(1) General. On each PFD lot that passes production testing, the manufacturer shall perform a final lot examination and, on every fifth lot, a laboratory inspector shall perform a final lot inspection. Samples must be selected in accordance with paragraph Sec. 160.076-29(e). Each final lot must demonstrate--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. On each PFD lot that passes production testing, the manufacturer shall perform a final lot examination and, on every fifth lot, a laboratory inspector shall perform a final lot inspection. Samples must be selected in accordance with paragraph Sec. 160.076-29(e). Each final lot must demonstrate--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> First quality workmanship;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the general arrangement and attachment of all components, such as body straps, closures, inflation mechanisms, tie tapes, and drawstrings, are as specified in the approved plans and specifications;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Compliance with the marking requirements in Sec. 160.076-39; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That the information pamphlet and owner's manual required by Sec. 160.076-35 and 160.076-37, respectively, are securely attached to the device, with the pamphlet selection information visible and accessible prior to purchase.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accept/reject criteria. Each nonconforming PFD must be rejected. If three or more nonconforming PFDs are rejected for the same kind of defect, lot examination or inspection must be discontinued and the lot rejected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Manufacturer examination. This examination must be conducted by a manufacturer's representative who is familiar with the approved plans and specifications, the functioning of the PFD and its components, and the production testing procedures. This person must not be responsible for meeting production schedules or be supervised by someone who is. This person must prepare and sign the record required by 159.007-13(a) of this chapter and 160.076-33(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Independent laboratory inspection. (i) The inspector must discontinue lot inspection and reject the lot if examination of individual PFDs or the records for the lot shows noncompliance with either this section or the laboratory's or the manufacturer's quality control procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The inspector must discontinue lot inspection and reject the lot if examination of individual PFDs or the records for the lot shows noncompliance with either this section or the laboratory's or the manufacturer's quality control procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the inspector rejects a lot, the inspector must advise the Commandant or the recognized laboratory within 15 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The inspector must prepare and sign the inspection record required by 159.007-13(a) of this chapter and 160.076-33(b). If the lot passes, the record must include the inspector's certification that the lot passed inspection and that no evidence of noncompliance with this section was observed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Disposition of rejected PFD lot or PFD. (1) A rejected PFD lot may be resubmitted for testing, examination or inspection if the manufacturer first removes and destroys each defective PFD or, if authorized by the Commandant, reworks the lot to correct the defect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A rejected PFD lot may be resubmitted for testing, examination or inspection if the manufacturer first removes and destroys each defective PFD or, if authorized by the Commandant, reworks the lot to correct the defect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any PFD rejected in a final lot examination or inspection may be resubmitted for examination or inspection if all defects have been corrected and reexamination or reinspection is authorized by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A rejected lot or rejected PFD may not be sold or offered for sale under the representation that it meets

this subpart or that it is Coast Guard-approved.
