Examples of reductions or discounts made in the ordinary course of business include standard volume discounts and reduced rates for corporate, governmental or preferred customers. Reductions or discounts provided under paragraph (a) of this section need not be reported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Items provided for promotional consideration.

In addition, the convention committee shall disclose in its report covering the period the goods or services are received, in a memo entry, a description

of the goods or services provided for promotional consideration, the name and address of the commercial vendor, and the dates on which the goods or services were provided (e.g., ``Generic Motor Co., Detroit, Michigan--ten automobiles for use 7/15-7/20, received on 7/14'', or ``Workers Inc., New York, New York--five temporary secretarial assistants for use 8/1-8/30, received on 8/1'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Items of de minimis value.

The items of de minimis value may be distributed by or with the help of persons employed by the commercial vendor, or employed by or volunteering for the national party or a host committee. The value of the items of de minimis value provided under this paragraph need not be reported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Expenditure Limits. The value of goods or services provided pursuant to this section will not count toward the national party's expenditure limitation under 11 CFR 9008.8(a).</p>
