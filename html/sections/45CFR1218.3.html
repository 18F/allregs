                            <p class="depth0">It is ACTION's policy to encourage the free exchange of views between volunteers and staff members with respect to the terms and conditions of the volunteers' service. Ordinarily these exchanges occur in the day-to-day contact between volunteers and staff. However, there are occasions when it is desirable to provide volunteers with an opportunity to present their views with respect to the terms and conditions of their service in a more formal way. The differences between ACTION regions require that the means selected in each region to accomplish this result be appropriate to its particular needs. This regulation provides standards within which regions must establish a procedure to enable volunteers to present their views to be heard with respect to the terms and conditions of their service on a regular basis by appropriate ACTION officials and receive a timely response to their concerns.</p>
