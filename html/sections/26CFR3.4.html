                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 607(e)(1) of the Act requires that three bookkeeping or memorandum accounts are to be established and maintained within the fund: the capital account, the capital gain account, and the ordinary income account. Deposits of the amounts under the subceilings in section 607(b) of the Act and Sec.  3.2 are allocated among the accounts under section 607(e) of the Act and this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Capital account. The capital account shall consist of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(B) of the Act and Sec.  3.2(a)(1)(ii) (relating to deposits for depreciation),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and Sec.  3.2(a)(1)(iii) (relating to deposits of net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of agreement vessels) other than that portion thereof which represents gain not taken into account for purposes of computing gross income by reason of section 607(d)(1)(B) of the Act and Sec.  3.3(b)(2) (relating to nontaxability of gain from the sale or other disposition of an agreement vessel),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amounts representing 85 percent of any dividend received by the fund with respect to which the party would, but for section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act and Sec.  3.3(b)(2)(ii) (relating to nontaxability of deposits of earnings from investment and reinvestment of amounts held in a fund), be allowed a deduction under section 243 of the Code, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Amounts received by the fund representing interest income which is exempt from taxation under section 103 of the Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Capital gain account. The capital gain account shall consist of amounts which represent the excess of (1) deposits of long-term capital gains on property referred to in section 607(b)(1) (C) and (D) of the Act and Sec.  3.2(a)(1) (iii) and (iv) (relating respectively to certain agreement vessels and fund assets), over (2) amounts representing losses from the sale or exchange of assets held in the fund for more than 6 months (for purposes of this section referred to as ``long-term capital losses''). For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an agreement vessel disposed of at a gain shall be treated as a capital

asset to the extent that gain thereon is not treated as ordinary income, including gain which is ordinary income under section 607(g)(5) of the Act (relating to treatment of gain on disposition of a vessel with a reduced basis) and Sec.  3.6(e) or under section 1245 of the Code (relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable property). For provisions relating to the treatment of short-term capital gains on certain transactions involving agreement vessels or realized by the fund, see paragraph (d) of this section. For rules relating to the treatment of capital losses on assets held in the fund, see paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ordinary income account. The ordinary income account shall consist of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act and Sec.  3.2(a)(1)(i) (relating to taxable income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amounts representing (i) deposits of gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for 6 months or less (for purposes of this section referred to as ``short-term capital gains'') referred to in section 607(b)(1) (C) or (D) of the Act and Sec.  3.2(a)(1) (iii) and (iv) (relating respectively to certain agreement vessels and fund assets), reduced by (ii) amounts representing losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets held in the fund for 6 months or less (for purposes of this section referred to as ``short-term capital losses''). For rules relating to the treatment of certain agreement vessels as capital assets, see paragraph (c) of this section,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amounts representing interest (not including any tax-exempt interest referred to in section 607(e)(2)(D) of the Act and paragraph (b)(4) of this section) and other ordinary income received on assets held in the fund (not including any dividend referred to in section 607(e)(2)(C) of the Act and subparagraph (5) of this paragraph),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Amounts representing ordinary income from a transaction (involving certain net proceeds with respect to an agreement vessel) described in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and Sec.  3.2(a)(1)(iii), including gain which is ordinary income under section 607(g)(5) of the Act and Sec.  3.6(e) (relating to treatment of gain on the disposition of a vessel with a reduced basis) or under section 1245 of the Code (relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable property), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Fifteen percent of any dividend referred to in section 607(e)(2)(C) of the Act and paragraph (b)(3) of this section received on any assets held in the fund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Limitation on deduction for capital losses on assets held in a fund. Except on termination of a fund, long-term (and short-term) capital losses on assets held in the fund shall be allowed only as an offset to long-term (and short-term) capital gains on assets held in the fund, but only if such gains are deposited into the fund, and shall not be allowed as an offset to any capital gains on assets not held in the fund. The net long-term capital loss of the fund for the taxable year shall reduce the earliest long-term capital gains in the capital gain account at the beginning of the taxable year and the net short-term capital loss for the taxable year shall reduce the earliest short-term capital gains remaining in the ordinary income account at the beginning of the taxable year. Any such losses that are in excess of the capital gains in the respective accounts shall reduce capital gains deposited into the respective accounts in subsequent years (without regard to section 1212, relating to capital loss carrybacks and carryovers). On termination of a fund, any net long-term capital loss in the capital gain account and any net short-term capital loss remaining in the ordinary income account is to be taken into account for purposes of computing the party's taxable income for the year of termination as a long-term or short-term (as the case may be) capital loss recognized in the year the fund is terminated. With respect to the determination of the basis to a fund of assets held in such fund, see Sec.  3.2(g).
