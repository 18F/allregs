                            <p class="depth0">All cases in which court actions to effect collection or to enforce  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 rights are  recommended, as well as actions relating to apparent violations of  Federal criminal statutes, will be handled under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Criminal action. When facts or circumstances indicate that  criminal violations may have been committed by an applicant, a borrower,  or third party purchaser, the State Director will refer the case to the  appropriate Regional Inspector General for Investigations, Office of  Inspector General (OIG), USDA, in accordance with FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-   354 Instruction 2012-B (available in any FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 office) for criminal investigation. Any  questions as to whether a matter should be referred will be resolved  through consultation with OIG for Investigations and the State Director  and confirmed in writing. In order to assure protection of the financial  and other interest of the government, a duplicate of the notification  will be sent to the Office of General Counsel (OGC). After OIG has  accepted any matter for investigation, FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 staff must coordinate with OIG in advance  regarding any administrative action on the matter/borrower other than  routine servicing actions on existing loans. Cases requiring further  action by OGC will be handled in accordance with paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Civil action. Court action or other judicial process will be  recommended to OGC when all other reasonable and proper efforts and  methods to obtain payment, to remove other defaults, and to protect FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's property/financial  interests have been exhausted. However, if an emergency situation exists  or criminal action is to be recommended, the case will be submitted to  OGC without taking the action necessary to report the information  required by Part II of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 455-22, ``Information for Litigation.'' This is because  delay in submitting cases in emergency situations may affect the  financial interests of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 and collection efforts may adversely affect the criminal  investigation and/or criminal prosecution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Civil action will be recommended when one or more of the  following conditions exists:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There is a need to repossess security or EO property or to  foreclose a lien and such action cannot be accomplished by other means  authorized in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is a need for filing claims against third parties because  of a conversion of security or other action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Payment due on debts are not made in accordance with the  borrower's ability to pay, and the borrower has assets or income from  which collection can be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The borrower has progressed to the point that credit can be  obtained from other sources, has agreed in the note or other instrument  to do so, but refuses to comply with that agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or its  security becomes involved in court action through foreclosure by a  third-party lienholder or through some other action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Other conditions exist which indicate that court action may be  necessary to protect FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354's interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Claims of less than $600 principal will not be referred to OGC  for court action unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement of facts is submitted as to the exact manner in  which the interest of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354, other than recovery of the amount involved, would be adversely  affected if suit were not filed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Collection of a substantial part of the claim can be made from  assets and income that are not exempt under State or Federal law. A  State supplement will be issued to set forth such exemptions or a  summary of those exemptions with respect to property to which FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 normally would look for  payment such as real estate, livestock, equipment, and income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When a borrower has not properly accounted for the proceeds of  the sale of security, it is the general policy to look first to the  borrower for restitution rather than to third-party purchasers. In line  with this policy the remaining chattel security on which FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 holds a first lien usually  will be liquidated before demand is made, or civil action to recover  from third-party purchasers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the County Supervisor determines that full collection  cannot be made from the borrower and that it will be necessary to  collect the full   value of the security purchased by a converter, a demand (see Guide  Letter 1962-A-1, a copy of which is available in any FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 county office) will be sent to  the purchaser at the same time that Exhibit D or E of Subpart A of Part  1955 of this chapter, is sent to the borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the County Supervisor determines that it is likely that  action will have to be taken to collect from third-party pruchasers, the  County Supervisor will notify such purchasers by letter (see Guide  Letter 1962-A-2, a copy of which is available in any FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 county office) that FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 security has been  purchased by them and that they may be called upon to return the  property or pay the value thereof in the event restitution is not made  by the borrower. If it later becomes necessary to make demand on such  third-party purchasers, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 will do so unless the case already has been referred to OGC or  the U.S. Attorney, in which event the demand will be made by one of  those offices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When restitution is made by the borrower, or a determination  is made, with the advice of OGC, that the facts in the case do not  support the claim against the third-party purchaser, the third-party  purchaser will be informed by the County Supervisor that FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will take no adverse action  (see Guide Letter 1962-A-3, a copy of which is available in any FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 county office).  Ordinarily, it will not be necessary to inform the third-party purchaser  of OGC's decision when OGC determines that the facts support the claim  against the third-party purchaser but no substantial part of the claim  can be collected. If OGC makes such a determination and the third-party  purchaser asks what determination has been made, the County Supervisor  will say that no further action is to be taken on the claim ``at this  time.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In addition, unless personal contacts with the third-party  purchaser, or other efforts to collect demonstrate that further demand  would be futile, and a satisfactory compromise offer has not been  received, a follow-up letter (see Guide Letter 1962-A-4, a copy of which  is available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 county office) will be sent by the State Director as soon as  possible after the 15-day period set forth in the demand letter has  expired. Unless response to the State Director's followup letter or  personal contacts or other efforts indicate that further demand would be  futile, an additional follow-up letter will be sent to the third-party  purchaser by OGC after the case has been referred to that office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> County Office actions. Forms FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 455-1, ``Request for Legal Action,'' and FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 455-22 will be prepared. Form  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 455-2, ``Evidence  of Conversion,'' will be prepared for each unauthorized disposal. The  original and two copies of Forms FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 455-1 and FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 455-22 and, wh=n applicable, FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 455-2 together with the borrower's case file,  will be submitted to the State Office. Signed statements should be  obtained, if possible, from the borrower, any third party purchasers, or  others to support the information contained on Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 455-1. Appropriate  recommendations regarding civil actions will be made on Forms FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 455-1 and FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 455-22 against the borrower or  others. When a case is referred to the State Office the County  Supervisor will keep that office informed of any future developments in   the case. If Attachments l, 2 and other appropriate attachments to  Exhibit A of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter have not been sent,  they will now be sent to the borrower and any other obligor(s) on the  note. Any appeal must be concluded before a civil action can be filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> District Office actions. Exhibits D, E, or E-1 of subpart A of  part 1955 of this chapter will be prepared and sent after any appeal is  concluded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> State Office actions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> upon receipt of Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 455-1 and, when applicable,  Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 455-2, the  State Director will analyze each form to determine if all of the  necessary information is documented and, if not, whether an appropriate  effort was made to obtain the information. If all the necessary  information is not documented, the State Director will return the case  and request the County Supervisor to obtain the information to complete  Forms FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 455-1 and  455-2. The State Director may assign any qualified FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 employee to help a County Supervisor  obtain the information necessary to complete the reports. After diligent  efforts, if FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  employees are unable to obtain the additional information, the case will  be returned to the State Office with an explanation of why the  information is unavailable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After all of the pertinent information available has been  obtained, the State Director will refer the case to OGC for civil  action, if referral is required under the policy expressed in this  section. If such referral is not required, the State Director will set  forth in Item 19 of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 455-1 the basis for the determination not to refer the case and  instructions for follow-up servicing action. The State Director will not  recommend a third-party conversion claim to the OGC if more than one  year has run from the date of the annual accounting following the  disposition of security, unless the Administrator or delegate determines  a longer period of time should be applied either because of compelling  circumstances such as the case has been referred to and accepted by OIG  for criminal or civil investigation. The period of time during which a  suit may be filed is set by federal statute and is not changed by this  section. Demands on third-party purchasers will be made in accordance  with paragraph (b) of this section. In cases referred to OGC, the State  Director will make comments and recommendations regarding the civil  aspects of the case on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 455-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> When cases are referred to OGC, the County Office case file,  Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 455-1, and,  when appropriate, Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 455-2 will be transmitted. In addition, when the institution of  civil court proceedings by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 is recommended, the notes, financing statements, security  agreements, loan agreements, other legal instruments and copies thereof,  as required by OGC, and Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 451-11, ``Statement of Account,'' and Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 455-22 will be submitted to  OGC. The State Director, with the advice of OGC, will determine the  number of copies of such instruments needed and the information required  on the certified statement of account. Each request for a certified  statement of account will specify the type of information needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Notes, statements of account, files, or other documents and  copies thereof needed in referring cases to OGC for civil court or other  action will be obtained from the Finance Office, or County Office, by  the State Director. When the time required for obtaining the above  material or documents may jeopardize FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354's interest by permitting the diversion or dissipation  of assets which otherwise could be expected as a source of payment, the  Finance Office, upon the request of the State Director, will forward  such material or documents directly to OGC or   (at the State Director's direction) to the U.S. Attorney.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Actions on cases referred to OGC. When a civil case is referred  to OGC, the State Director will notify the County Supervisor of the  referral and will return the County Office case file when it is no  longer needed. The State Director will also prepare and distribute Form  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1951-6 according  to the FMI. The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  field office will process the descriptive code via the FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 field office terminal system.  This will flag the borrower's account indicating court action is pending  (CAP). After notice of the referral is received by the County  Supervisor, no collection or servicing action will be taken except upon  specific instructions from the State Director or OGC. However, when a  borrower voluntarily proposes to make a payment on an account, the  County Supervisor will accept the collection unless notice has been  received that the case has been referred to the U.S. Attorney for civil  action. The County Supervisor will immediately notify OGC directly by  memorandum, with a copy sent to the State Director, of any collections  received. The County Supervisor also will notify the State Director and  OGC of any developments which may affect a case which has been referred  to OGC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Actions on cases referred to the U.S. Attorney and on judgement  cases (including third-party judgements). OGC will notify the State  Director, the Finance Office, and the County Supervisor when a case is  referred to the U.S. Attorney or is otherwise closed. When a case is  referred to the U.S. Attorney, the Finance Office will discontinue  mailing Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1951- 9, Annual ``Statement of Loan Account,'' to such borrowers. OGC will  also notify the State Director when a judgement (including third-party)  is obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When the County Supervisor receives notice from OGC that a  judgment (including third-party) has been obtained, the County  Supervisor will establish a judgment account by completing Form FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1962-20, ``Notice of  Judgment,'' in accordance with the FMI. The FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 field office will process the judgment or the  third party judgment via the FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 field office terminal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After notice has been received that a case has been referred to  the U.S. Attorney or a judgment has been obtained and has not been  returned to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 5by  the U.S. Attorney, no action will be taken by the County Supervisor  except upon specific instructions from the State Director, OGC, or the  U.S. Attorney. However, the County Supervisor will keep the State  Director informed of any developments which may affect the FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 security interest or any  pending court action to enforce collection. If information is obtained  indicating that such debtors have assets or income not previously  reported by the County Supervisor to the State Director from which  collection of such judgment accounts can be obtained, the facts will be  reported to the State Director. The State Director immediately will  notify OGC of any developments which might have a bearing on cases  referred to the U.S. Attorney, including such judgment cases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the debtor proposes to make a payment, FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 employees will not accept such payment  but will offer to assist in preparing a letter for the debtor's  signature to be used in transmitting the payment to the U.S. Attorney.  In such case, the debtor will be advised to make payment by check or  money order payable to the Treasurer of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Collection items received through the mail from the debtor or  from other sources by the County Office to be applied to such accounts  will be forwarded by the County Supervisor through OGC to the  appropriate U.S. Attorney. Likewise, collections received by the  District Director or the State Office will be forwarded through OGC to  the appropriate U.S. Attorney.   Such items will be forwarded in the form received except that cash will  be converted into money orders made payable to the Treasurer of the  United States. The money order receipts will remain attached to the  money orders. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  451-1 will not be issued in any such case. The debtor will be informed  in writing by the County Supervisor of the disposition of the amount  received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When the U.S. Attorney has returned a judgment case to FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, the County Supervisor is  responsible for servicing it as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the judgment debtor has the ability to make periodic  payments, action will be taken by the County Supervisor to make  arrangements for the judgment debtor to do so.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> At the time of the annual review of collection-only or  delinquent and problem cases, the County Supervisor will determine  whether such judgment debtors, whose judgments have not been charged off  and who are not making regular and satisfactory payments, have assets or  income from which the judgment can be collected. If such debtors have  either assets or income from which collection can be made and they have  declined to make satisfactory arrangements for payment, the facts will  be reported by the County Supervisor to the State Director. The State  Director will notify OGC of developments when it appears that  collections can be enforced out of income or assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Such judgments will not be renewed or revived unless there is a  reason to believe that substantial assets have or may become subject  thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Such judgments may be released only by the U.S. Attorney when  they are paid in full or compromised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In all judgment cases, any proposed compromise or adjustment  will be handled in accordance with Subpart B of Part 1956 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the debtor requests information as to the amount of  outstanding indebtedness, such information, including court costs,  should be obtained from the Finance Office if the County Supervisor does  not have that information. If questions arise as to the payment of court  costs, information as to such costs will be obtained through the State  Office from OGC.

Exhibit A to Subpart A of Part 1962--Memorandum of Understanding  Between Commodity Credit Corporation and Farmers Home Administration or</p><p class="depth0">its successor agency under Public Law 103-354</p><p class="depth0">IT IS HEREBY AGREED by and between the Farmers Home Administration  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 (hereinafter referred  to as ``FHA'') and the Commodity Credit Corporation (hereinafter  referred to as ``CCC'') that the following procedure will be observed in  those cases where producers sell to CCC or pledge to CCC as loan  collateral under the Price Support Program, agricultural commodities  such as, but not limited to, cotton, tobacco, peanuts, rice, soybeans,  grains, on which FHA holds a prior lien and the proceeds from such sales  or loans are not remitted to FHA for application against the loan(s)  secured by such lien:</p><p class="depth0">1. When an FHA County Supervisor learns that an FHA borrower has  obtained a loan from CCC on a commodity or sold a commodity to CCC under  such circumstances, he shall immediately notify his State Director. The  State Director, immediately upon receipt of the notice, shall furnish  CCC (see Appendix 1) with the name and address of such borrower, the  county of his location at the time the commodity was placed under loan  or sold, and the amount of the FHA loan secured by the lien.</p><p class="depth0">2. When CCC receives such a notice from FHA, CCC shall take steps to  prevent the making of any further loans on or purchases of the commodity  of the borrower. If the CCC loan is still outstanding and CCC calls the  loan, CCC shall notify the FHA State director of the demand.</p><p class="depth0">3. If the CCC loan is repaid, whether prior to or after the receipt  by CCC of the notice from FHA, the FHA State Director shall be notified  immediately, at which time CCC will have discharged its responsibility  under this agreement.</p><p class="depth0">4. FHA shall, in each case in which the CCC loan is not repaid or  the commodity has been sold to CCC, endeavor to collect from the  borrower the amount due on the FHA loan. Such collection efforts shall  include the making of demand on the borrower and the   following of FHA's normal administrative policies with respect to the  collection of debts, but shall not include the making of demand for  payment upon the area peanut producer cooperative marketing associations  through which CCC makes price support available to producers. If  collection efforts are not successful, the FHA County Supervisor shall  make a complete report on the matter to his State Director. If the State  Director determines that the amount due on the FHA lien is not  collectible by administrative action, he shall refer the matter to the  appropriate local office of the General Counsel, with a full statement  of the facts, for a determination of the validity of the FHA lien. If it  is determined by the General Counsel's Office that FHA holds a valid  prior lien on the commodity, the State Director shall furnish CCC with a  copy of such determination, together with all other pertinent  information, and shall request payment to FHA of the lesser of (1) the  amount due on its loan, or (2) the value of the commodity at the time  the CCC loan or purchase was made (based on the market value of the  commodity on the local market nearest to the place where the commodity  was stored). The information to be furnished CCC shall include (a) the  principal balance plus interest due FHA on the date of the request, (b)  the amount due on the FHA loan at the time the CCC loan or purchase was  made, and (c) the amount of the CCC loan or purchase proceeds, if any,  applied by the producer against the FHA loan. FHA shall continue to make  collection efforts and shall notify CCC of any amount collected from the  producer or any other party.</p><p class="depth0">5. Upon receipt of evidence, including a copy of the determination  of the Office of the General Counsel, from the State Director of FHA  that the proceeds from the CCC loan or purchase have not been received  by FHA from the borrower, and that collection cannot be made by FHA, CCC  will if the CCC loan has not been repaid or if CCC has purchased the  commodity, pay FHA the amount specified in paragraph 4 above or deliver  the commodity (or warehouse receipts representing the commodity) to FHA:  Provided, That if CCC has any information indicating that collection may  be made by FHA from the borrower or any other party, it may notify FHA  and delay payment pending additional collection efforts by FHA.</p><p class="depth0">6. It is the desire of both FHA and CCC that claims to be processed  under this agreement receive prompt attention by both parties and be  disposed of as soon as possible. Instructions for the implementation of  these procedures at the field office level will be developed and issued  by the Washington offices of FHA and CCC.</p><p class="depth0">7.

FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and CCC desire that price  support be made available to farmers without unnecessarily impairing or  undermining the respective security interests of FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 and CCC in and without undue  inconvenience to producers and FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 and CCC in securing lien waivers on such commodities.</p><p class="depth0">Now, therefore, it is agreed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Upon request of an official of a State ASCS office, the FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director in such  State shall furnish designated county ASCS offices with the names of  producers in the trade area from whom FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 holds currently effective liens on commodities with  respect to which CCC conducts price support programs. FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will try to furnish a complete  and current   list of the names of such producers; however, FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354's liens with respect to any commodity  will not be affected by an error in or omission from such lists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a loan disbursed by a county ASCS office, CCC will issue a  draft in the amount (Iess fees and charges due under CCC program  regulations) of the loan on, or purchase price of, the commodity payable  jointly to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the  producer if (a) his name is on the Iist furnished by FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354, or (b) he names FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 as lienholder.

The word ``subordinated'' means that, in the case of a  loan, CCC's security interest in the commodity shall be superior and  prior in right to that of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 and that, on purchase of a commodity by CCC or its acquisition  by CCC in satisfaction of a loan, the security interest of FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in such commodity shall  terminate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Nothing contained in this Memorandum of Understanding shall be  construed to affect the rights and obligations of the parties except as  specifically provided herein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> This agreement may be terminated by either party on 30 days'  written notice to the other party.</p><p class="depth0">Dated: July 20, 1980.</p><p class="depth0">Ray V.

[53 FR 35787, Sept. 14, 1988]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Exhibit C to Subpart A of Part 1962--Memorandum of Understanding  Between Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public</p><p class="depth0">Law 103-354 and Commodity Credit Corporation</p><p class="depth0">Rotation of Grain Crops</p><p class="depth0">Under the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Farmer-Owned Grain  Reserve Program, a producer may request to rotate or exchange new crop  grain for the original crop grain that is in the Farmer-Owned Grain  Reserve Program and already encumbered by CCC. The Farmers Home  Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 (FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354) may have subordinated  their first lien position to CCC on the original grain placed in reserve  and/or may have a first lien on the new crop. FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 and CCC desire to devise a mechanism  whereby the CCC can relinquish its first lien position on the original  grain reserve crop to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 and in turn the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 can relinquish its first lien position to CCC on the replacement  grain reserve crop.</p><p class="depth0">Now, therefore, it is agreed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Upon receipt of a memorandum from an Agricultural Stabilization  and Conservation Service (ASCS) County Executive Director or other  designated county office official requesting the rotation of a grain  reserve crop for a producer borrower(s), the FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 County Supervisor and the ASCS county  office official will jointly indicate approval or rejection of the  request on the bottom of the original and a copy of the memorandum  (Approval Memorandum) as follows:</p><p class="depth0">``We hereby agree to and authorize the rotation of the subject  producer's grain crops in accordance with the provisions of the  Memorandum of Understanding between Farmers Home Administration or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and Commodity Credit  Corporation dated--------.'' FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354___________________ ASCS____________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">In the memorandum, ASCS will include the name(s) of the producer(s)  desiring to rotate the grain crops, the approximate number of bushels  being rotated, the type of crop, years' crop being rotated and the  location of the original grain reserve crop (approximate land and  facility description).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upon execution of the Approval Memorandum by both ASCS and FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, the security interest  of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in the new crop  grain shall be subordinated to the security interest of CCC in such  grain and the security interest of CCC in the original crop grain shall  be subordinated to the security interest of FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 in such grain. At that point in time it will be  the responsibility of each agency and the borrower to account for their  respective interests in the grain crops and/or proceeds from the sale of  the grain. The crop rotation and subordination of liens will only  involve the amount of grain that has been specifically provided for in  the memorandum from ASCS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If there is an intervening third party lien and it is impossible  for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or CCC to have  a first lien on their respective grain crops, the request of the  producer to rotate crops will not be granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Nothing contained in this Memorandum of Understanding shall be  construed to affect the rights and obligations of the parties except as  specifically provided herein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> This agreement may be terminated by either party on 30 days  written notice to the other party.  [44 FR 4437, Jan. 22, 1979]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Exhibits D--D-1 to Subpart A of Part 1962 [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Exhibit E to Subpart A of Part 1962--Releasing Security Sales  Proceeds and Determining ``Essential'' Family Living and Farm Operating</p><p class="depth0">Expenses</p><p class="depth0">Family Living Expenses</p><p class="depth0">Expenses for household operating, food, clothing, medical care,  house repair, transportation, insurance and household appliances, i.e.,  stove, refrigerator, etc., are essential family living expenses. We do  not expect there will be any disagreements over this. However, when  proceeds are less than expenses, there might be disagreements about the  amounts FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 should  release to pay for particular items within these broad categories. For  example, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has to  release for transportation expenses, but should FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 release so that a borrower can buy a new  car? If at planning time or during the crop year it appears that there  will be sales proceeds available to pay for the borrower's operating and  living expenses, including the expense of a new car, the Form FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1962-1 can be completed to  show that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 plans to  release for a new car. On the other hand, it would also be proper to  complete the Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  1962-1 to release for a used car or for gas and repairs to the  borrower's present car. Since it is necessary for FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 to release for essential family living  expenses and because transportation is an essential family living  expense, some proceeds must be released for transportation. However,  nothing requires FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  to release for a specific expense; usually, there will be several ways  to use proceeds to provide for essential family living expenses. We must  provide the borrower with a written decision and an opportunity to  appeal whenever there is a disagreement over the use of proceeds or  whenever we reject a request for a release.</p><p class="depth0">Farm Operating Expenses</p><p class="depth0">We would expect farm operating expenses to present more of a problem  than family living expenses. There will probably be a few disagreements  over whether an expense is an operating expense (as opposed to a capital  expense), but it is more likely that there will be disagreements over  the amount FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 should  release for operating expenses and whether a particular farm operating  expense is ``essential.'' As is the case with family living expenses,  disagreements will most likely arise when proceeds are less than  expenses.</p><p class="depth0">To resolve disputes over the amount to be released, remember that we  must be reasonable and release enough to pay for essential farm  operating expenses. Although a borrower might not always agree that  enough money is being released, if the borrower's essential farm  operating expenses are being paid, we are fulfilling the requirements of  the statute. We must provide the borrower with an opportunity to appeal  when there is a disagreement over the use of proceeds or when we reject  a request for a release.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1962.17 of this subpart states that essential expenses are  those which are ``basic, crucial or indispensable.'' Whether an expense  is basic, crucial or indispensable depends on the circumstances. For  example, feed is a farm operating expense, but it is not always an  essential expense. If adequate pasture is available to meet the needs of  the borrower's animals, feed is not essential. Feed is essential if  animals are confined in lots. Hiring a custom harvester is a farm  operating expense, but is not an essential expense if the farmer has the  equipment and labor to harvest the crop just as well as a custom  harvester. Hired labor is an operating expense which might be essential  in a dairy operation but not in a beef cattle operation. Payments to  creditors are essential if the creditor is unable to restructure the  debt or to carry the debt delinquent. Renting land is not essential if  the borrower plans to use it to grow corn which can be purchased for  less than the cost of production. Paying outstanding bills is essential  if a supplier is refusing to provide additional credit but not if the  supplier is willing to carry a balance due. Of course, the long term  goal of any farming operation is to pay all of its expenses, but when  this is not possible, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 and the borrower must work together to decide which farm operating  expenses are essential and demand immediate attention and cannot   be neglected. These are the essential expenses.</p><p class="depth0">We absolutely must release to pay for essential family living and  farm operating expenses; there are no exceptions to this. When deciding  whether an expense is essential and when deciding how much to release,  the choices we make must be rational, reasonable, fair and not extreme.  They must be based on sound judgment, supported by facts, and explained  to the borrower. Following these rules will help us avoid disagreements  with borrowers.
