During the 30 minutes of idle operation, the engine may be run up periodically to a moderate power or thrust setting in a manner acceptable to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Supercharged reciprocating engines. For each engine having a supercharger to pressurize the air before it enters the carburetor, the heat rise in the air caused by that supercharging at any altitude may be utilized in determining compliance with paragraph (a) of this

section if the heat rise utilized is that which will be available, automatically, for the applicable altitude and operation condition because of supercharging.
