                            <p class="depth0">Five years after the revocation or cancellation ``with prejudice'' of a license, the ex-broker may petition the Assistant Commissioner for authorization to assist, or accept employment with, a broker. The petition will not be approved unless the Assistant Commissioner is satisfied that the petitioner has refrained from all activities described in Sec. 111.42 and that the petitioner's conduct has been exemplary during the period of disability. The Assistant Commissioner will also give consideration to the gravity of the misconduct which gave rise to the petitioner's disability. In any case in which the misconduct led to pecuniary loss to the Government or to any person, the Assistant Commissioner will also take into account whether the petitioner has made restitution of that loss.
