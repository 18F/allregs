The applicant, licensee, or certificate holder shall retain a copy of the request and all documents related to the request as a record until the Commission terminates the license or certificate for each facility or location involved with the request, or until the Commission notifies the applicant, licensee, or certificate holder that the applicant, licensee, or certificate holder is no longer under the Safeguards Agreement.

The Commission will take into account the obligation of the IAEA to take every precaution to protect commercial and industrial secrets and other confidential information coming to its knowledge in the implementation of the Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A request made under Sec. 2.390 of this chapter will not be treated as a request under this section unless the application makes specific reference to this section, nor shall a determination to withhold information from public disclosure necessarily require a determination that such information not be transmitted physically to the IAEA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a request is granted, the Commission will determine a location where the information will remain readily available for examination by the IAEA and will so inform the applicant, licensee, or certificate holder.
