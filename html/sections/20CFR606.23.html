                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. Subsection (g) of section 3302 of FUTA authorizes a State to avoid a tax credit reduction for a taxable year by meeting the three requirements of subsection (g). These requirements are met if the OWS Administrator determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advances were repaid by the State during the one-year period ending on November 9 of the taxable year in an amount not less than the sum of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The potential additional taxes (as estimated by the OWS Administrator) that would be payable by the State's employers if paragraph (2) of section 3302(c) of FUTA were applied for such taxable year (as estimated with regard to the cap on tax credit reduction for which the State qualifies under Sec. Sec. 606.20 to 606.22 with respect to such taxable year), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any advances made to such State during such one-year period under title XII of the Social Security Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There will be adequate funds in the State unemployment fund (as estimated by the OWS Administrator) sufficient to pay all benefits when due and payable under the State law during the three-month period beginning on November 1 of such taxable year without receiving any advance under title XII of the Social Security Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There is a net increase (as estimated by the OWS Administrator) in the solvency of the State unemployment compensation system for the taxable year and such net increase equals or exceeds the potential additional taxes for such taxable year as estimated under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Net increase in solvency. (1) The net increase in solvency for a taxable year, as determined for the purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, must be attributable to legislative changes made in the State law after the later of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The net increase in solvency for a taxable year, as determined for the purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, must be attributable to legislative changes made in the State law after the later of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> September 3, 1982, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date on which the first advance is taken into account in determining the amount of the potential additional taxes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The OWS Administrator shall determine the net increase in solvency by first estimating the difference between revenue receipts and benefit outlays under the law in effect for the year for which avoidance is requested, as if the relevant changes in State law referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section were not in effect for such year. The OWS Administrator shall then estimate the difference between revenue receipts and benefit outlays under the law in effect for the year for which the avoidance is requested, taking into account the relevant changes in State law referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The amount (if any) by which the second estimated difference exceeds the first estimated difference shall constitute the net increase in solvency for the purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Year taken into account. If a State qualifies for avoidance for any year, that year and January 1 of that year to which the avoidance applies will be taken into account for purposes of determining reduction of tax credits for subsequent taxable years.</p>
