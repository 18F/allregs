                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Environmental Impact Statements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prefiling Notice. Where an  environmental impact statement is required or contemplated, the  prospective applicant must provide the Section of Environmental Analysis  with written notice of its forthcoming proposal at least 6 months prior  to filing its application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice and scope of EIS. When an Environmental Impact Statement  is prepared for a proposed action, the Board will publish in the Federal  Register a notice of its intent to prepare an EIS, with a description of  the proposed action and a request for written comments on the scope of  the EIS. Where appropriate, the scoping process may include a meeting  open to interested parties and the public. After considering the  comments, the Board will publish a notice of the final scope of the EIS.  If the Environmental Impact Statement is to be prepared in cooperation  with other agencies, this notice will also indicate which agencies will  be responsible for the various parts of the Statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice of availability. The Board will serve copies of both the  draft Environmental Impact Statement (or an appropriate summary) and the  full final Environmental Impact Statement (or an appropriate summary) on  all parties to the proceeding and on appropriate Federal, State, and  local agencies. A   notice that these documents are available to the public will be  published (normally by the Environmental Protection Agency) in the  Federal Register. (Interested persons may obtain copies of the documents  by contacting the Section of Environmental Analysis.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Comments. The notice of availability of the draft Environmental  Impact Statement will establish the time for submitting written  comments, which will normally be 45 days following service of the  document. When the Board decides to hold an oral hearing on the merits  of a proposal, the draft Environmental Impact Statement will be made  available to the public in advance, normally at least 15 days prior to  the portion of the hearing relating to the environmental issues. The  draft EIS will discuss relevant environmental and historic preservation  issues. The final Environmental Impact Statement will discuss the  comments received and any changes made in response to them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Supplements. An Environmental Impact Statement may be  supplemented where necessary and appropriate to address substantial  changes in the proposed action or significant new and relevant  circumstances or information. If so, the notice and comment procedures  outlined above will be followed to the extent practical.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Environmental Assessments. In preparing an Environmental  Assessment, the Section of Environmental Analysis will verify and  independently analyze the Environmental Report and/or Historic Report  and related material submitted by an applicant pursuant to sections  1105.7 and 1105.8. The Environmental Assessment will discuss relevant  environmental and historic preservation issues. SEA will serve copies of  the Environmental Assessment on all parties to the proceeding and  appropriate federal, state, and local agencies, and will announce its  availability to the public through a notice in the Federal Register. In  the case of abandonment applications processed under 49 U.S.C. 10903,  the availability of the Environmental Assessment must be announced in  the applicant's Notice of Intent filed under 49 CFR 1152.21. The  deadline for submission of comments on the Environmental Assessment will  generally be within 30 days of its service (15 days in the case of a  notice of abandonment under 49 CFR 1152.50). The comments received will  be addressed in the Board's decision. A supplemental Environmental  Assessment may be issued where appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waivers. (1) The provisions of paragraphs (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> or (a)(4) of  this section or any STB-established time frames in paragraph (b) of this  section may be waived or modified where appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests for waiver of Sec.  1105.10(a)(1) must describe as  completely as possible the anticipated environmental effects of the  proposed action, and the timing of the proposed action, and show that  all or part of the six month lead period is not appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Third-Party Consultants. Applicants may utilize independent  third-party consultants to prepare any necessary environmental  documentation, if approved by SEA. The environmental reporting  requirements that would otherwise apply will be waived if a railroad  hires a consultant, SEA approves the scope of the consultant's work, and  the consultant works under SEA's supervision. In such a case, the  consultant acts on behalf of the Board, working under SEA's direction to  collect the needed environmental information and compile it into a draft  EA or draft EIS, which is then submitted to SEA for its review,  verification, and approval. We encourage the use of third-party  consultants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Service of Environmental Pleadings. Agencies and interested  parties sending material on environmental and historic preservation  issues directly to the Board should send copies to the applicant. Copies  of Board communications to third-parties involving environmental and  historic preservation issues also will be sent to the applicant where  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Consideration in decisionmaking. The environmental documentation  (generally an EA or an EIS) and the comments and responses thereto  concerning environmental, historic preservation, CZMA, and endangered  species   issues will be part of the record considered by the Board in the  proceeding involved. The Board will decide what, if any, environmental  or historic preservation conditions to impose upon the authority it  issues based on the environmental record and its substantive  responsibilities under the Interstate Commerce Act. The Board will  withhold a decision, stay the effective date of an exemption, or impose  appropriate conditions upon any authority granted, when an environmental  or historic preservation issue has not yet been resolved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Finding of No Significant Impact. In all exemption cases, if no  environmental or historic preservation issues are raised by any party or  identified by SEA in its independent investigation, the Board will issue  a separate decision making a Finding of No Significant Impact  (``FONSI'') to show that it has formally considered the environmental  record.
