Nonagreement State means any other State.</p><p class="depth0">Byproduct material means--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Any radioactive material (except special nuclear material) yielded in, or made radioactive by, exposure to the radiation incident to the process of producing or using special nuclear material;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The tailings or wastes produced by the extraction or concentration of uranium or thorium from ore processed primarily for its source material content, including discrete surface wastes resulting from uranium solution extraction processes. Underground ore bodies depleted by these solution extraction operations do not constitute ``byproduct material'' within this definition;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)(i)</em> Any discrete source of radium-226 that is produced, extracted, or converted after extraction, before, on, or after August 8, 2005, for use for a commercial, medical, or research activity; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Any discrete source of radium-226 that is produced, extracted, or converted after extraction, before, on, or after August 8, 2005, for use for a commercial, medical, or research activity; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Any material that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(A)</em> Has been made radioactive by use of a particle accelerator; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(B)</em> Is produced, extracted, or converted after extraction, before, on, or after August 8, 2005, for use for a commercial, medical, or research activity; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Any discrete source of naturally occurring radioactive material, other than source material, that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The Commission, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the head of any other appropriate Federal agency, determines would pose a threat similar to the threat posed by a discrete source of radium-226 to the public health and safety or the common defense and security; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Before, on, or after August 8, 2005, is extracted or converted after extraction for use in a commercial, medical, or research activity.</p><p class="depth0">Commission means the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its duly authorized representatives;</p><p class="depth0">Discrete source means a radionuclide that has been processed so that its concentration within a material has been purposely increased for use for commercial, medical, or research activities.</p><p class="depth0">Foreign obligations means the commitments entered into by the U.S. Government under Atomic Energy Act

(AEA) section 123 agreements for cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Imports and exports of material or equipment pursuant to such agreements are subject to these commitments, which in some cases involve an exchange of information on imports, exports, retransfers with foreign governments, peaceful end-use assurances, and other conditions placed on the transfer of the material or equipment. The U.S. Government informs the licensee of obligations attached to material.</p><p class="depth0">Government agency means any executive department, commission, independent establishment, corporation, wholly or partly owned by the United States of America which is an instrumentality of the United States, or any board, bureau, division, service, office, officer, authority, administration, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government.</p><p class="depth0">Offshore waters means that area of land and water, beyond Agreement States' Submerged Lands Act jurisdiction, on or above the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.</p><p class="depth0">Person means: (1) Any individual, corporation, partnership, firm, association, trust, estate, public or private institution, group, agency, and State or any political subdivision of any political entity within a State, and any legal successor, representative, agent, or agency of the foregoing other than Government agencies;</p><p class="depth0">Production facility means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Any equipment or device determined by rule of the Commission to be capable of the production of special nuclear material in such quantity as to be of significance to the common defense and security, or in such manner as to affect the health and safety of the public, including a uranium enrichment facility; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Any important component part especially designed for such equipment or device as determined by the Commission.</p><p class="depth0">Reconciliation means the process of evaluating and comparing licensee reports required under this part to the projected material balances generated by the Nuclear Materials Management and Safeguards System. This process is considered complete when the licensee resolves any differences between the reported and projected balances, including those listed for foreign obligated materials.</p><p class="depth0">Source material means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Uranium, thorium, or any other material which is determined by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of section 61 of the Act to be source material; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Ores containing one or more of the foregoing materials, in such concentration as the Commission may by regulation determine from time to time;</p><p class="depth0">Special nuclear material means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Plutonium, uranium 233, uranium enriched in the isotope 233 or in the isotope 235, and any other material which the Commission, pursuant to the provisions of section 51 of the Act, determines to be special nuclear material, but does not include source material; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Any material artificially enriched by any of the foregoing but does not include source material;</p><p class="depth0">State means any State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any territory or possession of the United States; and</p><p class="depth0">Utilization facility means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Any equipment or device, except an atomic weapon, determined by rule of the Commission to be capable of making use of special nuclear material in such quantity as to be of significance to the common defense and security, or in such manner as to affect the health and safety of the public, or peculiarly adapted for making use of atomic energy in such quantity as to be of significance to the common defense and security, or in such manner as to affect the health and safety of the public; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Any important component part especially designed for such equipment or device as determined by the Commission.</p><p class="depth0">Uranium enrichment facility means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Any facility used for separating the isotopes of uranium or enriching uranium in the isotope 235, except laboratory scale facilities designed or used for experimental or analytical purposes only; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Any equipment or device, or important component part especially designed for such equipment or device, capable of separating the isotopes of uranium or enriching uranium in the isotope 235.
