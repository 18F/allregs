                                Sec. 301.6059-2  Required use of magnetic media for filing requirements
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Magnetic media filing requirements under section 6059. An actuarial report required under section 6059 with respect to an employee benefit plan must be filed on magnetic media if the filer is required by the Internal Revenue Code or regulations to file at least 250 returns during the calendar year that includes the first day of the plan year. Actuarial reports filed on magnetic media must be made in accordance with applicable revenue procedures, publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance on the IRS.gov Internet Web site. In prescribing revenue procedures, publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance on the IRS.gov Internet Web site, the Commissioner may direct the type of magnetic media filing. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Economic hardship waiver. The Commissioner may waive the requirements of this section in cases of undue economic hardship. The principal factor in determining hardship will be the amount, if any, by which the cost of

filing the reports on magnetic media in accordance with this section exceeds the cost of filing the reports on other media. A request for a waiver must be made in accordance with applicable published guidance, publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance on the IRS.gov Internet Web site. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter. The waiver will specify the type of filing (that is, an actuarial report required under section 6059) and the period to which it applies. In addition, the waiver will be subject to such terms and conditions regarding the method of filing as may be prescribed by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to file. If a filer required to file an actuarial report under section 6059 fails to file the report on magnetic media when required to do so by this section, the filer is deemed to have failed to file the report. See section 6692 for the penalty for the failure to file an actuarial report. In determining whether there is reasonable cause for failure to file the report, Sec. 301.6692-1(c) and rules similar to the rules in Sec. 301.6724-1(c)(3)(ii) (regarding undue economic hardship related to filing information returns on magnetic media) will apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Meaning of terms. The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Magnetic media. The term magnetic media means electronic filing, as well as other media specifically permitted under applicable regulations, revenue procedures, or publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance on the IRS.gov Internet Web site. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Actuarial report required under section 6059--(i) Single employer plans. For a single employer plan, the term actuarial report required under section 6059 means the Schedule SB, ``Single-Employer Defined Benefit Plan Actuarial Information,'' of the Form 5500 series (or its successor).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Single employer plans. For a single employer plan, the term actuarial report required under section 6059 means the Schedule SB, ``Single-Employer Defined Benefit Plan Actuarial Information,'' of the Form 5500 series (or its successor).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Multiemployer and certain money purchase plans. For multiemployer and certain money purchase plans, the term actuarial report required under section 6059 means the Schedule MB, ``Multiemployer Defined Benefit Plan and Certain Money Purchase Plan Actuarial Information,'' of the Form 5500 series (or its successor).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determination of 250 returns--(i) In general. For purposes of this section, a filer is required to file at least 250 returns if, during the calendar year that includes the first day of the plan year, the filer is required to file at least 250 returns of any type, including information returns (for example, Forms W-2 and Forms 1099), income tax returns, employment tax returns, and excise tax returns.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this section, a filer is required to file at least 250 returns if, during the calendar year that includes the first day of the plan year, the filer is required to file at least 250 returns of any type, including information returns (for example, Forms W-2 and Forms 1099), income tax returns, employment tax returns, and excise tax returns.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of filer. For purposes of this section, the term filer means the plan administrator within the meaning of section 414(g). If the plan administrator within the meaning of section 414(g) is the employer, the special rules in Sec. 1.6058-2(d)(3)(iii) will apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example. In 2016, P, the plan administrator of Plan B (a single employer defined benefit plan), is required to file 266 returns (including Forms 1099-R ``Distributions From Pensions, Annuities, Retirement, Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc.'' and one Form 5500 series). Plan B's plan year is the calendar year. Because P is required to file at least 250 returns during the calendar year, P must file the 2016 Schedule SB of the Form 5500 series return for Plan B electronically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable for actuarial reports required to be filed under section 6059 for plan years that begin on or after January 1, 2015, but only for filings with a filing deadline (not taking into account extensions) after December 31, 2015.
