                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individual property subdivided. An individual property, other  than Farm Credit Programs property, may be offered for sale as a whole  or subdivided into parcels as determined by the State Director. For MFH  property, guidance will be requested from the National Office for all  properties other than RHS projects. When farm inventory property is  larger than a family-size farm, the county official will subdivide the  property into one or more tracts to be sold in accordance with Sec.  1955.107 of this subpart. Division of the land or separate sales of  portions of the property, such as timber, growing crops, inventory for  small business enterprises, buildings, facilities, and similar items may  be permitted if a better total price for the property can be obtained in  this manner. Environmental effects should also be considered pursuant to  subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter. Any applicable State laws will  be set forth in a State supplement and will be complied with in  connection with the division of land. Subdivision of acquired property  will be reported on Form RD 1955-3C, ``Acquired Property--Subdivision,''  in accordance with the FMI.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grouping of individual properties. The county official for FCP  cases, and the State Director for all other cases, may authorize the  combining of two or more individual properties into a single parcel for  sale as a suitable program property.
