                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The initial generator of a solid waste must determine each EPA  Hazardous Waste Number (waste code) applicable to the waste in order to  determine the applicable treatment standards under subpart D of this  part. This determination may be made concurrently with the hazardous  waste determination required in Sec.  262.11 of this chapter. For  purposes of part 268, the waste will carry the waste code for any  applicable listed waste (40 CFR part 261, subpart D). In addition, where  the waste exhibits a characteristic, the waste will carry one or more of  the characteristic waste codes (40 CFR part 261, subpart C), except when  the treatment standard for the listed waste operates in lieu of the  treatment standard for the characteristic waste, as specified in  paragraph (b) of this section. If the generator determines that their  waste displays a hazardous characteristic (and is not D001  nonwastewaters treated by CMBST, RORGS, OR POLYM of Sec.  268.42, Table  1), the generator must determine the underlying hazardous constituents  (as defined at Sec.  268.2(i)) in the characteristic waste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where a prohibited waste is both listed under 40 CFR part 261,  subpart D and exhibits a characteristic under 40 CFR part 261, subpart  C, the treatment standard for the waste code listed in 40 CFR part 261,  subpart D will operate in   lieu of the standard for the waste code under 40 CFR part 261, subpart  C, provided that the treatment standard for the listed waste includes a  treatment standard for the constituent that causes the waste to exhibit  the characteristic. Otherwise, the waste must meet the treatment  standards for all applicable listed and characteristic waste codes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to any applicable standards determined from the  initial point of generation, no prohibited waste which exhibits a  characteristic under 40 CFR part 261, subpart C may be land disposed  unless the waste complies with the treatment standards under subpart D  of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Wastes that exhibit a characteristic are also subject to Sec.   268.7 requirements, except that once the waste is no longer hazardous, a  one-time notification and certification must be placed in the  generator's or treater's on-site files. The notification and  certification must be updated if the process or operation generating the  waste changes and/or if the subtitle D facility receiving the waste  changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The notification must include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name and address of the RCRA Subtitle D facility receiving the  waste shipment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the waste as initially generated, including  the applicable EPA hazardous waste code(s), treatability group(s), and  underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in Sec.  268.2(i)), unless  the waste will be treated and monitored for all underlying hazardous  constituents. If all underlying hazardous constituents will be treated  and monitored, there is no requirement to list any of the underlying  hazardous constituents on the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The certification must be signed by an authorized representative  and must state the language found in Sec.  268.7(b)(4).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If treatment removes the characteristic but does not meet  standards applicable to underlying hazardous constituents, then the  certification found in Sec.  268.7(b)(4)(iv) applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]  [55 FR 22688, June 1, 1990, as amended at 56 FR 3878, Jan. 31, 1991; 57  FR 37271, Aug. 18, 1992; 58 FR 29885, May 24, 1993; 59 FR 48045, Sept.  19, 1994; 60 FR 245, Jan. 3, 1995; 61 FR 15599, 15662, Apr. 8, 1996; 62  FR 26022, May 12, 1997; 64 FR 25415, May 11, 1999; 71 FR 16913, Apr. 4,  2006]</p>
