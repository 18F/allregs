For example, an  affiliate of a Federal credit union is a credit union service  corporation, as provided in 12 CFR part 712, that is controlled by the  Federal credit union.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Common ownership or common corporate control means a  relationship between two companies under which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One company has, with respect to the other company:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ownership, control, or power to vote 25 percent or more of the  outstanding shares of any class of voting security of a company,  directly or indirectly, or acting through one or more other persons;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Control in any manner over the election of a majority of the  directors, trustees, or general partners (or individuals exercising  similar functions) of a company; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The power to exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling  influence over the management or policies of a company, as determined by  the applicable prudential regulator (as defined in 12 U.S.C. 5481(24))  (a credit union is presumed to have a controlling influence over the  management or policies of a credit union service corporation if the  credit union service corporation is 67% owned by credit unions) or,  where there is no prudential regulator, by the Bureau; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any other person has, with respect to both companies, a  relationship described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Company means any corporation, limited liability company,  business trust, general or limited partnership, association, or similar  organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Consumer means an individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Identifying information means any name or number that may be  used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a  specific person, including any:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name, social security number, date of birth, official state or  government issued driver's license or identification number, alien  registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer  identification number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unique biometric data, such as fingerprint, voice print, retina  or iris image, or other unique physical representation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unique electronic identification number, address, or routing  code;

and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That may include additional information or documentation that  an information furnisher or consumer reporting agency reasonably  requests for the purpose of determining the validity of the alleged  identity theft, provided that the information furnisher or consumer  reporting agency:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Makes such request not later than fifteen days after the date of  receipt of the copy of the report form identified in Paragraph  (i)(1)(ii) of this section or the request by the consumer for the  particular service, whichever shall be the later;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Makes any supplemental requests for information or documentation  and final determination on the acceptance of the identity theft report  within another fifteen days after its initial request for information or  documentation; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Shall have five days to make a final determination on the  acceptance of the identity theft report, in the event that the consumer  reporting agency or information furnisher receives any such additional  information or documentation on the eleventh day or later within the  fifteen day period   set forth in Paragraph (i)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples of the specificity referenced in Paragraph (i)(1)(i) of  this section are provided for illustrative purposes only, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Specific dates relating to the identity theft such as when the  loss or theft of personal information occurred or when the fraud(s)  using the personal information occurred, and how the consumer discovered  or otherwise learned of the theft.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identification information or any other information about the  perpetrator, if known.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Name(s) of information furnisher(s), account numbers, or other  relevant account information related to the identity theft.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any other information known to the consumer about the identity  theft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples of when it would or would not be reasonable to request  additional information or documentation referenced in Paragraph  (i)(1)(iii) of this section are provided for illustrative purposes only,  as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A law enforcement report containing detailed information about  the identity theft and the signature, badge number or other  identification information of the individual law enforcement official  taking the report should be sufficient on its face to support a victim's  request. In this case, without an identifiable concern, such as an  indication that the report was fraudulent, it would not be reasonable  for an information furnisher or consumer reporting agency to request  additional information or documentation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A consumer might provide a law enforcement report similar to  the report in Paragraph (i)(1) of this section but certain important  information such as the consumer's date of birth or Social Security  number may be missing because the consumer chose not to provide it. The  information furnisher or consumer reporting agency could accept this  report, but it would be reasonable to require that the consumer provide  the missing information. The Bureau's Identity Theft Affidavit is  available on the Bureau's Web site (consumerfinance.gov/learnmore). The  version of this form developed by the Federal Trade Commission,  available on the FTC's Web site (ftc.gov/idtheft), remains valid and  sufficient for this purpose.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A consumer might provide a law enforcement report generated by  an automated system with a simple allegation that an identity theft  occurred to support a request for a tradeline block or cessation of  information furnishing. In such a case, it would be reasonable for an  information furnisher or consumer reporting agency to ask that the  consumer fill out and have notarized the Bureau's Identity Theft  Affidavit or a similar form and provide some form of identification  documentation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A consumer might provide a law enforcement report generated by  an automated system with a simple allegation that an identity theft  occurred to support a request for an extended fraud alert. In this case,  it would not be reasonable for a consumer reporting agency to require  additional documentation or information, such as a notarized affidavit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Medical information means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information or data, whether oral or recorded, in any form or  medium, created by or derived from a health care provider or the  consumer, that relates to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The past, present, or future physical, mental, or behavioral  health or condition of an individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The provision of health care to an individual; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The payment for the provision of health care to an individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term does not include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The age or gender of a consumer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Demographic information about the consumer, including a  consumer's residence address or email address;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any other information about a consumer that does not relate to  the physical, mental, or behavioral health or condition of a consumer,  including the existence or value of any insurance policy; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Information that does not identify a specific consumer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Person means any individual, partnership, corporation, trust,  estate cooperative, association, government or governmental subdivision  or agency, or other entity.
