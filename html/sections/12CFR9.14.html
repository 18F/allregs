                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If state law requires corporations acting in a  fiduciary capacity to deposit securities with state authorities for the  protection of private or court trusts, then before a national bank acts  as a private or court-appointed trustee in that state, it shall make a  similar deposit with state authorities. If the state authorities refuse  to accept the deposit, the bank shall deposit the securities with the  Federal Reserve Bank of the district in which the national bank is  located, to be held for the protection of private or court trusts to the  same extent as if the securities had been deposited with state  authorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acting in a fiduciary capacity in more than one state. If a  national bank acts in a fiduciary capacity in more than one state, the  bank may compute the amount of securities that are required to be  deposited for each state on   the basis of the amount of assets for which the bank is acting in a  fiduciary capacity at offices located in that state. If state law  requires a deposit of securities on a basis other than assets (e.g., a  requirement to deposit a fixed amount or an amount equal to a percentage  of capital), the bank may compute the amount of deposit required in that  state on a pro-rated basis, according to the proportion of fiduciary  assets for which the bank is acting in a fiduciary capacity at offices  located in that state.
