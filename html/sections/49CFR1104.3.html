                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An executed original, plus 10 copies, of every paper pleading,  document, or paper permitted or required to be filed under this  subchapter, including correspondence, must be furnished for the use of  the Board, unless otherwise specifically directed by another Board  regulation or notice in an individual proceeding. Copies may be  reproduced by any duplicating process, provided all copies are clear and  legible. Appropriate notes or other indications shall be used so that  matters shown in color on the original, but in black and white on the  copies, will be accurately identified on all copies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Electronic submissions accompanying paper filings must be  furnished as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Textual submissions of 20 or more pages must be accompanied by  three   electronic copies submitted on compact discs or 3.5-inch IBM-compatible  formatted floppy diskettes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Three sets of evidence or workpapers consisting of mathematical  computations must be submitted as functioning electronic spreadsheets in  Lotus 1-2-3 Release 9 or Microsoft Excel 97, or compatible versions, on  compact discs or 3.5-inch IBM-compatible formatted floppy diskettes. In  order to fully evaluate evidence, all spreadsheets must be fully  accessible and manipulable. Electronic databases placed in evidence or  offered as support for spreadsheet calculations must be compatible with  the Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) standard. ODBC is a  Windows technology that allows a database software package to import  data from a database created using a different software package. We  currently use Microsoft Access 97 and databases submitted should be in  either this format or another ODBC-compatible format. All databases must  be supported with adequate documentation on data attributes, SQL  queries, programmed reports, and so forth.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> One copy of each diskette or compact disc submitted to the Board  should, if possible, be provided to any other party requesting a copy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each diskette and compact disc must be clearly labeled with the  Docket Number of the proceeding in which it is filed; the name(s) of the  party(ies) on whose behalf the filing is made, and ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or  ``REDACTED'' as appropriate. If more than one diskette or disc is  submitted for one filing, the label of each must be sequentially  numbered to indicate the diskette or disc number and the total number of  diskettes or discs filed (e.g., the first disc of a 4-disc set should be  labeled ``Disc 1 of 4,'' the second disc ``Disc 2 of 4,'' and so forth).
