The answer shall specifically admit or deny each allegation or charge made in the order, and shall set forth the matters of fact and law on which the licensee or other person relies, and, if the order is not consented to, the reasons as to why the order should not have been issued. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the answer may demand a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the answer demands a hearing, the Commission will issue an order designating the time and place of hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the answer demands a hearing with respect to an immediately effective order, the hearing will be conducted expeditiously, giving due consideration to the rights of the parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> (i) The licensee or other person to whom the Commission has issued an

immediately effective order may, in addition to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate effectiveness of the order on the ground that the order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error. The motion must state with particularity the reasons why the order is not based on adequate evidence and must be accompanied by affidavits or other evidence relied on. The NRC staff shall respond within (5) days of the receipt of the motion. The motion must be decided by the presiding officer expeditiously. During the pendency of the motion or at any other time, the presiding officer may not stay the immediate effectiveness of the order, either on its own motion, or upon motion of the licensee or other person. The presiding officer will uphold the immediate effectiveness of the order if it finds that there is adequate evidence to support immediate effectiveness. An order upholding immediate effectiveness will constitute the final agency action on immediate effectiveness. An order setting aside immediate effectiveness will be referred promptly to the Commission itself and will not be effective pending further order of the Commission.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The licensee or other person to whom the Commission has issued an

An order that has been consented to shall have the same force and effect as an order made after hearing by a presiding officer or the Commission, and shall be effective as provided in the order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> If the order involves the modification of a part 50 license and is a backfit, the requirements of Sec. 50.109 of this chapter shall be followed, unless the licensee has consented to the action required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the order involves the modification of a part 50 license and is a backfit, the requirements of Sec. 50.109 of this chapter shall be followed, unless the licensee has consented to the action required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the order involves the modification of combined license under subpart C of part 52 of this chapter, the requirements of Sec. 52.98 of this chapter shall be followed unless the licensee has consented to the action required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the order involves a change to an early site permit under subpart A of part 52 of this chapter, the requirements of Sec. 52.39 of this chapter must be followed, unless the applicant or licensee has consented to the action required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the order involves a change to a standard design certification rule referenced by that plant's application, the requirements, if any, in the referenced design certification rule with respect to changes must be followed, or, in the absence of these requirements, the requirements of Sec. 52.63 of this chapter must be followed, unless the applicant or licensee has consented to follow the action required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the order involves a change to a standard design approval referenced by that plant's application, the requirements of Sec. 52.145 of this chapter must be followed unless the applicant or licensee has consented to follow the action required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the order involves a modification of a manufacturing license under subpart F of part 52, the requirements of Sec. 52.171 of this chapter must be followed, unless the applicant or licensee has consented to the action required.
