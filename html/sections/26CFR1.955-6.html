For  purposes of the preceding sentence, a reasonable down payment shall not  exceed 28 percent of the total cost of acquisition. The determination  dates applicable to the taxable year of a controlled foreign corporation  are those set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.

The application of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On December 31, 1976, controlled foreign corporation X  owns 100 percent of the single class of stock of controlled foreign  corporation Y. X and Y both use the calendar year as the taxable year.  On December 31, 1976, Y's assets consist of a vessel used in foreign  commerce, related shipping assets, and other assets unrelated to its  foreign base company shipping operations. On such date Y has qualified  investments in foreign base company shipping operations (determined  under paragraph (g) of this section) of   $60,000, and a net worth of $100,000. If X's investment in the stock of  Y is $50,000, then $30,000 of such amount, i.e., [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09OC91.012   is a qualified investment in foreign base company shipping operations.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that on  December 31, 1976, Y's assets consist entirely of a vessel used in  foreign commerce and related shipping assets, Y has qualified  investments in foreign base company shipping operations (determined  under paragraph (g) of this section) of $16,000 and (therefore) a net  worth of $16,000. If X's investment in the stock of Y is $50,000, then  the entire $50,000, i.e., [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09OC91.013   is a qualified investment in foreign base company shipping operations.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On December 31, 1980, controlled foreign corporation J  owns two notes of controlled foreign corporation K, which is a related  person (within the meaning of section 954(d)(3)). Both J and K use the  calendar year as the taxable year. J's adjusted basis in each of the two  notes is $100,000. The first note is secured only by the general credit  of K. The second note is secured by (and, therefore, constitutes a  specific charge on) a hotel owned by K in a foreign country. On December  31, 1980, K has qualified investments in foreign base company shipping  operation with an adjusted basis of $500,000 (before applying the rules  of paragraph (g) of this section). The adjusted basis of all of K's  corporate assets is $1,100,000. K's only liabilities are the two notes.  The amount of K's qualified investments in foreign base company shipping  operations (determined under paragraph (g) of this section) is $450,000.  K's net worth is $900,000. The amount of J's qualified investment in  foreign base company shipping operations in respect of the first note is  $50,000, i.e., [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09OC91.014   The amount of J's qualified investment in respect of the second note is  zero (see the last sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Partnerships--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this  pargraph, if a controlled foreign corporation is treated as the owner of  any portion of a trust under subpart E of part I of subchapter J  (relating to grantors and others treated as substantial owners), then  for purposes of this section such controlled foreign corporation is  deemed to be the actual owner of such portion of the assets of the  trust. Accordingly, its investments in such assets (as determined under  paragraph (g)(5) of this section) may be treated as a qualified  investment in foreign base company shipping operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term ``trust''  means a trust as defined in Sec. 301.7701-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Excluded property. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this  section, property acquired principally for the purpose of artificially  increasing the amount of a controlled foreign corporation's qualified  investments in foreign base company shipping operations will not be   recognized; whether an item of property is acquired principally for such  purpose will depend upon all the facts and circumstances of each case.  One of the factors that will be considered in making such a  determination with respect to an item of property is whether the item is  disposed of within 6 months after the date of its acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Amount attributable to property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule.

An application to revoke the election, as of a  specified group taxable year, with respect to one or more (but not all)  controlled foreign corporations, subject to an election shall be deemed  to be an application to revoke the election. Approval will not be  granted unless a material and substantial change in circumstances occurs  which could not have been anticipated when the election was made. The  application for consent to revocation shall be made by mailing a letter  for such purpose to Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: T:C:C,  Washington, DC 20224, containing a statement of the facts which justify  such consent. If a member of a related group subject to an election  ceases to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for  membership in the group by reason of any action taken by it or any  member of the group or the electing United States shareholder, then the  election will be deemed to be revoked as of the beginning of the taxable  year in which such action occurred. If such action is taken principally  for the purpose of revoking the election without applying for and  obtaining the approval of the Commissioner to the revocation, then no  further election covering any member of that related group may be made  by any United States shareholder for the remainder of the taxable year  in which the action occurred and the five succeeding taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Coordination with section 955(b)(). If a United States  shareholder elects under this section to treat two or more controlled  foreign corporations as a related group for any taxable year, and if  such United States shareholder is required under Sec. 1.955A-4(c)(2) for  purposes of filing any return to estimate the qualified investments in  foreign base company shipping operations of any member of such group,  then such United States shareholder shall, for purposes of filing such  return, determine the amount includible in his gross income in respect  of each member of such related group on the basis of such estimate. If  the actual amount of such investments is not the same as the amount of  the estimate, the United States shareholder shall immediately notify the  Commissioner. The Commissioner will thereupon redetermine the amount of  tax of such United States shareholder for the year or years with respect  to which the incorrect amount was taken into account. The amount of tax,  if any, due upon such redetermination shall be paid by the United States  shareholder upon notice and demand by the district director. The amount  of tax, if any, shown by such redetermination to have been overpaid  shall be credited or refunded to the United States shareholder in  accordance with the provisions of sections 6402 and 6511 and the  regulations thereunder. If a United States shareholder elects under   this section and if the United States shareholder has made an election  under section 955(b)(3) as to at least one member of the related group,  then the qualified investment amounts necessary for the calculations of  paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section shall be obtained, for each  member of the related group, as of the determination dates applicable to  each of the members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Illustrations.

The amount of tax, if  any, shown by such redetermination to have been overpaid shall be  credited or refunded to the United States shareholder in accordance with  the provisions of sections 6402 and 6511 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Revocation. Upon application by the United States shareholder,  the election made under this section may, subject to the approval of the  Commissioner, be revoked. Approval will not be granted unless the United  States shareholder and the Commissioner agree to the terms, conditions,  and adjustments under which the revocation will be effected. Unless such  agreement provides otherwise, the change in the controlled foreign  corporation's qualified investments in foreign base company shipping  operations for its first taxable year for which income is computed  without regard to the election previously made will be considered to be  zero for purposes of effectuating the revocation. The application for  consent to revocation shall be made by the United States shareholder's  mailing a letter for such purpose to the Commissioner of Internal  Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. The application shall be mailed before  the close of the first taxable year of the controlled foreign  corporation with respect to which the shareholder desires to compute the  amounts described in section 954(b)(2) or 955(a) without regard to the  election provided in this section. The application shall include the  following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the  United States shareholder:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The name and address of the controlled foreign corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation for  which such amounts are to be computed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The amount of the controlled foreign corporation's qualified  investments in foreign base company shipping operations at the close of  its preceding taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The sum of the amounts excluded under section 954(b)(2) and  Sec. 1.954-1(b)(1) from the foreign base company income of the  controlled foreign corporation for all prior taxable years during which  such shareholder was a United States shareholder of such corporation and  the sum of the amounts of its previously excluded subpart F income  withdrawn from investment in foreign base company shipping operations  for   all prior taxable years during which such shareholder was a United  States shareholder of such corporation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The reasons for the request for consent to revocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transfer of stock. If during any taxable year of a controlled  foreign corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A United States shareholder who has made an election under this  section with respect to such controlled foreign corporation sells,  exchanges, or otherwise disposes of all or part of his stock in such  controlled foreign corporation, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation  immediately after the sale, exchange, or other disposition,  then, with respect to the stock so sold, exchanged, or disposed of, the  change in the controlled foreign corporation's qualified investments in  foreign base company shipping operations for such taxable year shall be  considered to be zero. If the United States shareholder's successor in  interest is entitled to and does make an election under paragraph (b)(1)  of this section to determine the controlled foreign corporation's  increase in qualified investments in foreign base company shipping  operations for the taxable year in which he acquires such stock, such  increase with respect to the stock so acquired shall be determined in  accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1.954-7(b)(1). If the controlled  foreign corporation realizes no foreign base company income from which  amounts are excluded under section 954(b)(2) and Sec. 1.954-1(b)(1) for  the taxable year in which the United States shareholder's successor in  interest acquires such stock and such successor in interest makes an  election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to a  subsequent taxable year of such controlled foreign corporation, the  increase in the controlled foreign corporation's qualified investments  in foreign base company shipping operations for such subsequent taxable  year shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of  Sec. 1.954-7(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Illustrations. The application of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Foreign corporation A is a wholly owned subsidiary of  domestic corporation M. Both corporations use the calendar year as a  taxable year. In a statement filed with its return for 1977, M makes an  election under section 955(b)(3) and the election remains in force for  the taxable year 1978. At December 31, 1978, A's qualified investments  in foreign base company shipping operations amount to $100,000; and, at  December 31, 1979, to $80,000. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, A Corporation's decrease in qualified investments in foreign  base company shipping operations for the taxable year 1978 is $20,000  and is determined by ascertaining the amount by which A Corporation's  qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations at  December 31, 1978 ($100,000) exceed its qualified investments in foreign  base company shipping operations at December 31, 1979 ($80,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that A  experiences no changes in qualified investments in foreign base company  shipping operations during its taxable years 1980 and 1981. If M's  election were to remain in force, A's acquisitions and dispositions of  qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations during  A's taxable year 1982 would be taken into account in determining whether  A has experienced an increase or a decrease in qualified investments in  foreign base company shipping operations for its taxable year 1981.  However, M duly files before the close of A's taxable year 1981 as  application for consent to revocation of M Corporation's election under  section 955(b)(3), and, pursuant to an agreement between the  Commissioner and M, consent is granted by the Commissioner. Assuming  such agreement does not provide otherwise, A's change in qualifed  investments in foreign base company shipping operations for its taxable  year 1981 is zero because the effect of the revocation of the election  is to treat acquisitions and dispositions of qualified investments in  foreign base company shipping operations actually occurring in 1982 as  having occurred in such year rather than in 1981.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 2 except that A's  qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations at  December 31, 1982, amount to $70,000. For purposes of paragraph  (b)(1)(i) of Sec. 1.955A-1, the decrease in A's qualified investments in  foreign base company shipping operations for the taxable year 1982 is  $10,000 and is determined by ascertaining the amount by which A's  qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations at  December 31, 1981 ($80,000) exceed its qualified investments in foreign  base company shipping operations at December 31, 1982 ($70,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in example 1. Assume further  that on September   30, 1979, M sells 40 percent of the only class of stock of A to N  Corporation, a domestic corporation. N uses the calendar year as a  taxable year. A remains a controlled foreign corporation immediately  after such sale of its stock. A's qualified investments in foreign base  company shipping operations at December 31, 1980, amount to $90,000. The  changes in A Corporation's qualified investments in foreign base company  shipping operations occurring in its taxable year 1979 are considered to  be zero with respect to the 40-percent stock interest acquired by N  Corporation. The entire $20,000 reduction in A Corporation's qualified  investments in foreign base company shipping operations which occurs  during the taxable year 1979 is taken into account by M for purposes of  paragraph (c)(1) of this section in determining its tax liability for  the taxable year 1978. A's increase in qualified investments in foreign  base company shipping operations for the taxable year 1979 with respect  to the 60-percent stock interest retained by M is $6,000 and is  determined by ascertaining M's pro rata share (60 percent) of the amount  by which A's qualified investments in foreign base company shipping  operations at December 31, 1980 ($90,000) exceed its qualified  investments in foreign base company shipping operations at December 31,  1979 ($80,000). N does not make an election under section 955(b)(3) in  its return for its taxable year 1980. Corporation A's increase in  qualified investments in foreign base company shipping operations for  the taxable year 1980 with respect to the 40-percent stock interest  acquired by N is $4,000.
