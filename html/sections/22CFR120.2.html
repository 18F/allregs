                            <p class="depth0">The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778(a) and 2794(7)) provides  that the President shall designate the articles and services deemed to  be defense articles and defense services for purposes of import or  export controls. The President has delegated to the Secretary of State  the authority to control the export and temporary import of defense  articles and services. The items designated by the Secretary of State  for purposes of export and temporary import control constitute the U.S.  Munitions List specified in part 121 of this subchapter. Defense  articles on the U.S. Munitions List specified in part 121 of this  subchapter that are also subject to permanent import control by the  Attorney General on the U.S. Munitions Import List enumerated in 27 CFR  part 447 are subject to temporary import controls administered by the  Secretary of State. Designations of defense articles and defense  services are made by the Department of State with the concurrence of the  Department of Defense. The scope of the U.S. Munitions List shall be  changed only by amendments made pursuant to section 38 of the Arms  Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778). For a designation or determination  on whether a particular   item is enumerated on the U.S. Munitions List, see Sec. 120.4 of this  subchapter.  [78 FR 22752, Apr. 16, 2013]</p>
