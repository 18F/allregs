The negotiated settlement or final decision will be  final, subject only to a contractor's appeal under the provisions of the  Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613), or other  procedures as applicable. Policies and procedures for resolving audit  recommendations are in accordance with USAID's internal policies found  in ADS Chapters 591 and 592.  [79 FR 74990, Dec. 16, 2014]</p>
