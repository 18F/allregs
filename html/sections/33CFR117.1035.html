                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term drawtender, as used in this section means the operator of the drawspan, whether that person may be a train crew member, maintenance person, or an officially designated drawtender.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The draw of the semi-automated Union Pacific railroad bridge (Kalan

Bridge), mile 323.4, near Kennewick, Washington, is normally maintained in the fully open position with no drawtender in attendance. A radar beacon (RACON) is located at the center of the drawspan. The RACON operates only when the drawspan is fully open, by responding with the Morse letter ``K'' to X-band radar signals. When necessary to close the drawspan for the passage of a train or for maintenance, a drawtender shall be dispatched to operate the draw from either of the remote control stations located at the ends of the bridge. Operation of the bridge shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The drawtender shall broadcast a radio message over Channel 16-VHF to all vessels in the vicinity that the Kalan Bridge will be closing in two minutes. If after two minutes no response is received, the drawtender shall broadcast a message over Channel 13-VHF that the Kalan Bridge is closing. Both messages shall be broadcast twice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to activating the closing sequence the drawtender shall visually inspect the waterway for marine traffic approaching the bridge. The closing sequence shall not be activated until after marine traffic has cleared the bridge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the closing sequence is activated, the following functions occur automatically: The RACON is deactivated, red strobe lights on the lift towers and on the channel piers start flashing, a downward pointing arrow consisting of amber colored lights is displayed from the center of the drawspan and a recorded message is broadcast over Channel 13-VHF advising that the Kalan Bridge is closed to river traffic. The radio message is repeated every five minutes, the red lights continue to flash and the downward pointing arrow is displayed, until the lift span returns to the up and locked position. At the end of the ten minutes, a horn sounds for 30 seconds, the span begins closing and the centerspan navigation lights turn from green to red. The horn sounds for 30 seconds at 10 minute intervals, until the lift span returns to the up and locked position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If for any reason during the closing sequence a danger is posed to marine traffic, the closing sequence shall be stopped and the bridge reopened until the threat of danger has passed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the bridge is to be temporarily closed for maintenance or for purposes other than the passage of a train, the drawtender shall continually monitor Channels 13 and 16 for calls from approaching vessels, and respond to inquiries from vessels about the closure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> After a train has cleared the bridge, the following functions occur automatically: The drawspan returns to the fully open and locked position, the RACON is reactivated, the arrow display and the red strobe lights are extinguished, the red centerspan navigation lights return to green and a recorded message is broadcast over Channel 13-VHF that the Kalan Bridge is open for marine traffic.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Bridge status information may be obtained by calling the commercial telephone number posted at the drawspan of the bridge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The draw of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad bridge at mile 328.0, between Pasco and Kennewick, shall open on signal from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. At all other times the draw shall open on signal if at least 2 hour's notice is given through the General Yardmaster, Pasco, Washington.
