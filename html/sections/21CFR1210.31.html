                            <p class="depth0">Before violation of the act is referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution under section 5 of the Federal Import Milk Act, an opportunity to be heard will be given to the party against whom prosecution is under consideration. The hearing will be private and confined to questions of fact. The party notified may present evidence, either oral or written, in person or by attorney, to show cause why he should not be prosecuted. After a hearing is held, if it appears that the law has been violated, the facts will be reported to the Department of Justice.
