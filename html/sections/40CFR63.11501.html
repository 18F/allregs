Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent  practicable to make these repairs; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The frequency, amount, and duration of the violation  (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or  a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,  personal injury, or severe property damage; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the  violation on ambient air quality, the environment and human health; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in  operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air  pollution control practices; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> All of the actions in response to the violation were  documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> At all times, the affected CMPU was operated in a manner  consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of  which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the  malfunction and the violation resulting from the malfunction event at  issue. The analysis must also specify, using best monitoring methods and  engineering judgment, the amount of any emissions that were the result  of the malfunction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Report. If you seek to assert an affirmative defense, you must  submit a written report to the Administrator, with all necessary  supporting documentation, that you have met the requirements set forth  in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. This affirmative defense report  must be included in the first periodic compliance report, deviation  report, or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial  occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the  end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance report,  deviation report, or excess emission report is due less than 45 days  after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmative defense  report may be included in the second compliance report, deviation  report, or excess emission report due after the initial occurrence of  the violation of the relevant standard.
