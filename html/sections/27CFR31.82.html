                            <p class="depth0">The proprietor of a hotel who conducts the sale of liquors  throughout the hotel premises is only required to register under this  part for one place. For example, different areas operated by the  proprietor in the hotel, such as banquet rooms, meeting rooms, and guest  rooms, collectively constitute a single place of business. When a  concessionaire conducts the sale of liquors   at two or more areas in a hotel, those areas are regarded as a single  place of business, and the concessionaire is required to register only  once.</p>
