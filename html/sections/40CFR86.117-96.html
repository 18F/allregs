                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The calibration of evaporative emission enclosures consists of three parts: initial and periodic determination of enclosure background emissions (hydrocarbons and methanol); initial determination of enclosure internal volume; and periodic hydrocarbon and methanol retention check and calibration. Ethanol retention checks may be performed instead of methanol retention checks. Alcohol retentions may be omitted if no alcohol-fueled vehicles will be tested in the evaporative enclosure. For evaporative and refueling emission tests with ethanol-gasoline blends that have less than 25% ethanol by volume, if you account for ethanol with a mathematical adjustment as described in Sec. 86.1813-17(a)(1)(iv) instead of measuring ethanol, the testing specifications and diagnostic requirements in this part 86 that are specific to ethanol-gasoline blends do not apply. Alternate calibration methods may be used if shown to yield equivalent or superior results, and if approved in advance by the Administrator; specifically, more extreme temperatures may be used for determining calibration without affecting the validity of test results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial and periodic determination of enclosure background emissions. Prior to its introduction into service, annually thereafter, and after any repair that can affect the enclosure background emissions, the enclosure shall be checked to determine that it does not contain materials that will themselves

emit hydrocarbons or methanol. When methanol as well as hydrocarbons are present in the evaporative enclosure, the HFID hydrocarbon concentration measurement includes the partial response of the HFID to methanol plus the hydrocarbons. Determination of the HFID response to methanol, Sec. 86.121, prior to its being placed in service is required for the determination of hydrocarbons. Proceed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prepare the enclosure. (i) Variable-volume enclosures may be operated in either latched or unlatched volume configuration, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Ambient temperatures shall be maintained at 96[3 F throughout the 4-hour period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Variable-volume enclosures may be operated in either latched or unlatched volume configuration, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Ambient temperatures shall be maintained at 96[3 F throughout the 4-hour period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fixed-volume enclosures may be operated with inlet and outlet flow streams either closed or open; if inlet and outlet flow streams are open, the air flowing into and out of the enclosure must be monitored in accordance with Sec. 86.107-96(a)(1)(ii)(B). Ambient temperatures shall be maintained at 96[3 F throughout the 4-hour period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For running loss enclosures ambient temperatures shall be maintained at 95[3 F throughout the 4-hour period. For running loss enclosures designed with a vent for makeup air, the enclosure shall be operated with the vent closed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The enclosure may be sealed and the mixing fan operated for a period of up to 12 hours before the 4-hour background sampling period begins.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Zero and span (calibrate if required) the hydrocarbon analyzer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Prior to the background determination, purge the enclosure until a stable background hydrocarbon reading is obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Turn on the mixing blower (if not already on).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Seal enclosure and measure background hydrocarbon concentration, background methanol, temperature, and barometric pressure.</p><p class="depth3">These are the initial readings CHCi, CCH3OHi, and PBi, Ti for the enclosure background determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Allow the enclosure to stand undisturbed for four hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Measure the hydrocarbon concentration on the same FID and the methanol level. These are the final concentrations, CHCf and CCH3OHf. Also measure final temperature and barometric pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Calculate the mass change of methanol, hydrocarbons, and hydrocarbons plus methanol in the enclosure according to the equations in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Diurnal enclosures. The enclosure background emissions (hydrocarbons plus methanol) shall not be greater than 0.05g for the 4 hours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Running loss enclosures. The enclosure background emissions (hydrocarbons plus methanol) shall not be greater than 0.2 grams for the 4 hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial determination of enclosure internal volume. Prior to its introduction into service the enclosure internal volume shall be determined by the following procedure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Carefully measure the internal length, width and height of the enclosure, accounting for irregularities (such as braces) and calculate the internal volume. For variable-volume enclosures, latch the enclosure to a fixed volume when the enclosure is held at a constant temperature; this nominal volume shall be repeatable within [0.5 percent of the reported value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)-(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hydrocarbon and methanol (organic gas) retention check and calibration. The hydrocarbon and methanol (if the enclosure is used for methanol-fueled vehicles) retention check provides a check upon the calculated volume and also measures the leak rate. The enclosure leak rate shall be determined prior to its introduction into service, following any modifications or repairs to the enclosure that may affect the integrity of the enclosure, and at least monthly thereafter. The methanol retention check must be performed only upon initial installation and after major maintenance, consistent with good engineering judgment. If six consecutive monthly retention checks are successfully completed without corrective action, the enclosure leak rate may be determined quarterly thereafter as long as no corrective action is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An enclosure to be used for the diurnal emission test (see Sec. 86.133-96)

shall be calibrated according to the following procedure. Calibration for hydrocarbon and methanol may be conducted simultaneously or in sequential test runs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Zero and span (calibrate if required) the hydrocarbon analyzer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Purge the enclosure until a stable background hydrocarbon reading is obtained.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Turn on the mixing blowers (if not already on).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Turn on the ambient temperature control system (if not already on) and adjust it for an initial temperature of 96 F (36 C). On variable-volume enclosures, latch the enclosure to the appropriate volume position for the set temperature. On fixed-volume enclosures close the outlet and inlet flow streams.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> When the enclosure stabilizes at 96[3 F (36[2 C), seal the enclosure and measure background hydrocarbon concentration, background methanol, temperature, and barometric pressure. These are the initial readings CHCi, CCH3OHi, Ti, and PBi for the enclosure calibration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Inject into the enclosure 0.5 to 1.0 grams of pure methanol at a recommended temperature of at least 150 F (65 C) and/or 0.5 to 1.0 grams of pure propane at lab ambient temperature. The injected quantity may be measured by volume flow or by mass measurement. The method used to measure the quantity of methanol and propane must have an accuracy of [0.5 percent of the measured value (less accurate methods may be used with the advance approval of the Administrator).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> After a minimum of 5 minutes of mixing, analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbon and methanol content, also record temperature and pressure. These measurements are the final readings for the enclosure calibration as well as the initial readings for the retention check.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> To verify the enclosure calibration, calculate the mass of propane and the mass of methanol using the measurements taken in paragraphs (c)(1)(vi) and (viii) of this section. See paragraph (d) of this section. This quantity must be within [2 percent of that measured in paragraph (c)(1)(vii) of this section for propane and [5 percent for methanol. Evaluate long-term trends using good engineering judgment to minimize measurement bias. Keep records to document such evaluations and make them available to EPA upon request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> For variable-volume enclosures, unlatch the enclosure from the nominal volume configuration. For fixed-volume enclosures, open the outlet and inlet flow streams.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Start cycling the ambient temperature from 96 F to 72 F and back to 96 F over a 24-hour period, according to the profile specified in Sec. 86.133-96 and appendix II of this part, within 15 minutes of sealing the enclosure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> At the completion of the 24-hour cycling period, analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbon and methanol content; determine the net withdrawn methanol (in the case of diurnal emission testing with fixed volume enclosures); record temperature and barometric pressure. These are the final readings for the hydrocarbon and methanol retention check. The final hydrocarbon and methanol mass, calculated in paragraph (d) of this section, shall be within three percent of that determined in paragraph (c)(1)(viii) of this section. (For 1991-1995 calendar years, the difference may exceed [3 percent for methanol, provided it does not exceed [6 percent.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An enclosure to be used for the running loss test (see Sec. 86.134-96) shall meet the calibration and retention requirements of Sec. 86.117-90(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Enclosures calibrated according to the procedures specified in either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section may be used for hot soak testing (see Sec. 86.138).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Calculations. (1) The calculation of net methanol and hydrocarbon mass change is used to determine enclosure background and leak rate. It is also used to check the enclosure volume measurements. The methanol mass change is calculated from the initial and final methanol samples, the net withdrawn methanol (in the case of diurnal emission testing with fixed-volume enclosures), and initial and final temperature and pressure according to the following equation:

For the point-source method, the running loss fuel vapor sampling system shall be calibrated as a CVS system, as specified in Sec. 86.119, with the additional specification that the vapor sampling system verification be conducted as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following ``gravimetric'' technique can be used to verify that the vapor sampling system and analytical instruments can accurately measure a mass of gas that has been injected into the system. If the vapor sampling system will be used only in the testing of petroleum-fueled engines, the system verification may be performed using propane. If the vapor sampling system will be used with methanol-fueled vehicles as well as petroleum-fueled vehicles, the system verification performance check must include a methanol check in addition to the propane check.

Obtain another small cylinder that has been charged with pure methanol if the system will be used for methanol-fueled vehicle testing.
