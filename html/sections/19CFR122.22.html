The private aircraft pilot is responsible for ensuring the  notice of arrival and manifest information regarding each individual  onboard the aircraft are transmitted to CBP. The pilot is responsible  for the submission, accuracy, correctness, timeliness, and completeness  of the submitted information, but may authorize another party to submit  the information on their behalf. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7)  of this section, all data must be transmitted to CBP by means of an  electronic data interchange system approved by CBP and must set forth  the information specified in this section. All data pertaining to the  notice of arrival for the aircraft and the manifest data regarding each  individual onboard the aircraft must be transmitted at the same time via  an electronic data interchange system approved by CBP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Time for submission. The private aircraft pilot is responsible  for ensuring that the information specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and  (b)(4) of this section is transmitted to CBP:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For flights originally destined for the United States, any time  prior to departure of the aircraft, but no later than 60 minutes prior  to departure of the aircraft from the foreign port or place; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For flights not originally destined to the United States, but  diverted to a U.S. port due to an emergency, no later than 30 minutes  prior to arrival; in cases of non-compliance, CBP will take into  consideration that the carrier was not equipped to make the transmission  and the circumstances of the emergency situation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Manifest data required.

The advance notice of arrival must include  the following information about the aircraft and where applicable, the  pilot:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Aircraft tail number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Type of Aircraft;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Call sign (if available);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> CBP issued decal number (if available);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Place of last departure (ICAO airport code, when available);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Date of aircraft arrival;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Estimated time of arrival;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Estimated time and location of crossing U.S. border/ coastline;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Name of intended U.S. airport of first landing (as listed in  Sec. 122.24 if applicable, unless an exemption has been granted under  Sec. 122.25, or the aircraft was inspected by CBP Officers in the U.S.  Virgin Islands);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Owner/Lessees name (if individual: Last, first, and, if  available, middle; or business entity name, if applicable);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Owner/Lessees address (number and street, city, state, zip/ postal code, country, telephone number, fax number, and email address);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Pilot/Private aircraft pilot name (last, first, middle, if  available);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> Pilot license number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiv)</em> Pilot street address (number and street, city, state, zip/ postal code, country, telephone number, fax number, and email address);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xv)</em> Country of issuance of pilot's license;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xvi)</em> Operator name (for individuals: last, first, and if available,  middle; or business entity name, if applicable);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xvii)</em> Operator street address (number and street, city, state, zip  code, country, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xviii)</em> Aircraft color(s);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xix)</em> Complete Itinerary (foreign airports landed at within past 24  hours prior to landing in United States); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xx)</em> 24-hour Emergency point of contact (e.g., broker, dispatcher,  repair shop, or other third party contact or individual who is  knowledgeable about this particular flight) name (first, last, middle,  if available) and phone number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reliable facilities. When reliable means for giving notice are  not available (for example, when departure is from a remote place) a  landing must be made at a foreign place where notice can be sent prior  to coming into the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Permission to land. Prior to departure from the foreign port or  place, the pilot of a private aircraft must receive a message from DHS  approving landing within the United States, and follow any instructions  contained therein prior to departure. Once DHS has approved departure,  and the pilot has executed all instructions issued by DHS, the aircraft  is free to depart with the intent of landing at the designated U.S. port  of entry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Changes to manifest. The private aircraft pilot is obligated to  make necessary changes to the arrival manifest after transmission of the  manifest to   CBP. If changes to an already transmitted manifest are necessary, an  updated and amended manifest must be resubmitted to CBP. Only amendments  regarding flight cancellation, expected time of arrival (ETA) or changes  in arrival location, to an already transmitted manifest may be submitted  telephonically, by radio, or through existing processes and procedures.  On a limited case-by-case basis, CBP may permit a pilot to submit or  update notice of arrival and arrival/departure manifest information  telephonically when unforeseen circumstances preclude submission of the  information via eAPIS. Under such circumstances, CBP will manually enter  the notice of arrival and arrival/departure manifest information  provided by the pilot and the pilot is required to wait for CBP  screening and approval to depart. Changes in ETA and arrival location  must be coordinated with CBP at the new arrival location to ensure that  resources are available to inspect the arriving aircraft. If a  subsequent manifest is submitted less than 60 minutes prior to departure  to the United States, the private aircraft pilot must receive approval  from CBP for the amended manifest containing added passenger information  and/or changes to information that were submitted regarding the aircraft  and all individuals onboard the aircraft, before the aircraft is allowed  to depart the foreign location, or the aircraft may be, as appropriate,  diverted from arriving in the United States, or denied permission to  land in the United States. If a subsequent, amended manifest is  submitted by the pilot, any approval to depart the foreign port or  location previously granted by CBP as a result of the original  manifest's submission is invalid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Pilot responsibility for comparing information collected with  travel document. The pilot collecting the information described in  paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section is responsible for  comparing the travel document presented by each individual to be  transported onboard the aircraft with the travel document information he  or she is transmitting to CBP in accordance with this section in order  to ensure that the information is correct, the document appears to be  valid for travel purposes, and the individual is the person to whom the  travel document was issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Electronic manifest requirement for all individuals onboard  private aircraft departing from the United States; departure  information--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General requirement. The private aircraft pilot is  responsible for ensuring that information regarding private aircraft  departing the United States, and manifest data for all individuals  onboard the aircraft is timely transmitted to CBP. The pilot is  responsible for the accuracy, correctness, timeliness, and completeness  of the submitted information, but may authorize another party to submit  the information on their behalf. Data must be transmitted to CBP by  means of an electronic data interchange system approved by CBP, and must  set forth the information specified in paragraph (c)(3) and (c)(4) of  this section. All data pertaining to the aircraft, and all individuals  onboard the aircraft must be transmitted at the same time. On a limited  case-by-case basis, CBP may permit a pilot to submit or update notice of  arrival and arrival/departure manifest information telephonically to CBP  when unforeseen circumstances preclude submission of the information via  eAPIS. Under such circumstances, CBP will manually enter the notice of  arrival and arrival/departure manifest information provided by the pilot  and the pilot is required to wait for CBP screening and approval to  depart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Time for submission.
