                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reimbursement on a reasonable cost basis. Providers of services  paid on the basis of the reasonable cost of services furnished to  beneficiaries will receive interim payments approximating the actual  costs of the provider. These payments will be made on the most  expeditious schedule administratively feasible but not less often than  monthly. A retroactive adjustment based on actual costs will be made at  the end of a reporting period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount and frequency of payment. Medicare states that providers  of services will be paid the reasonable cost of services furnished to  beneficiaries. Since actual costs of services cannot be determined until  the end of the accounting period, the providers must be paid on an  estimated cost basis during the year. While Medicare provides that  interim payments will be made no less often than monthly, contractors  are expected to make payments on the most expeditious basis  administratively feasible. Whatever estimated cost basis is used for  determining interim payments during the year, the intent is that the  interim payments shall approximate actual costs as nearly as is  practicable so that the retroactive adjustment based on actual costs  will be as small as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interim payments during initial reporting period. At the  beginning of the   program or when a provider first participates in the program, it will be  necessary to establish interim rates of payment to providers of  services. Once a provider has filed a cost report under the Medicare  program, the cost report may be used as a basis for determining the  interim rate of reimbursement for the following period. However, since  initially there is no previous history of cost under the program, the  interim rate of payment must be determined by other methods, including  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the contractor is already paying the provider on a cost or  cost-related basis, the contractor will adjust its rate of payment to  the program's principles of reimbursement. This rate may be either an  amount per inpatient day, or a percent of the provider's charges for  services furnished to the program's beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an organization other than the contractor is paying the  provider for services on a cost or cost-related basis, the contractor  may obtain from that organization or from the provider itself the rate  of payment being used and other cost information as may be needed to  adjust that rate of payment to give recognition to the program's  principles of reimbursement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It no organization is paying the provider on a cost or cost- related basis, the contractor will obtain the previous year's financial  statement from the provider. By analysis of such statement in light of  the principles of reimbursement, the contractor will compute an  appropriate rate of payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After the initial interim rate has been set, the provider may at  any time request, and be allowed, an appropriate increase in the  computed rate, upon presentation of satisfactory evidence to the  contractor that costs have increased. Likewise, the contractor may  adjust the interim rate of payment if it has evidence that actual costs  may fall significantly below the computed rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interim payments for new providers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Newly-established  providers will not have cost experience on which to base a determination  of an interim rate of payment. In such cases, the contractor will use  the following methods to determine an appropriate rate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If there is a provider or providers comparable in substantially  all relevant factors to the provider for which the rate is needed, the  contractor will base an interim rate of payment on the costs of the  comparable provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If there are no substantially comparable providers from whom  data are available, the contractor will determine an interim rate of  payment based on the budgeted or projected costs of the provider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under either method, the contractor will review the provider's  cost experience after a period of three months. If need for an  adjustment is indicated, the interim rate of payment will be adjusted in  line with the provider's cost experience.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Interim payments after initial reporting period. Interim rates  of payment for services provided after the initial reporting period will  be established on the basis of the cost report filed for the previous  year covering Medicare services. The current rate will be determined-- whether on a per diem or percentage of charges basis--using the previous  year's costs of covered services and making any appropriate adjustments  required to bring, as closely as possible, the current year's rate of  interim payment into agreement with current year's costs. This interim  rate of payment may be adjusted by the contractor during an accounting  period if the provider submits appropriate evidence that its actual  costs are or will be significantly higher than the computed rate.  Likewise, the contractor may adjust the interim rate of payment if it  has evidence that actual costs may fall significantly below the computed  rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Retroactive adjustment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Medicare provides that providers of  services will be paid amounts determined to be due, but not less often  than monthly, with necessary adjustments due to previously made  overpayments or underpayments. Interim payments are made on the basis of  estimated costs. Actual costs reimbursable to a provider cannot be  determined until the cost reports are filed and costs are verified.  Therefore, a retroactive adjustment will be made at the end of the  reporting period to bring the interim payments made to the provider  during the   period into agreement with the reimbursable amount payable to the  provider for the services furnished to program beneficiaries during that  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In order to reimburse the provider as quickly as possible, an  initial retroactive adjustment will be made as soon as the cost report  is received. For this purpose, the costs will be accepted as reported,  unless there are obvious errors or inconsistencies, subject to later  audit. When an audit is made and the final liability of the program is  determined, a final adjustment will be made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To determine the retroactive adjustment, the amount of the  provider's total allowable cost apportioned to the program for the  reporting year is computed. This is the total amount of reimbursement  the provider is due to receive from the program and the beneficiaries  for covered services furnished during the reporting period. The total of  the interim payments made by the program in the reporting year and the  deductibles and coinsurance amounts receivable from beneficiaries is  computed. The difference between the reimbursement due and the payments  made is the amount of the retroactive adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Accelerated payments to providers. Upon request, an accelerated  payment may be made to a provider of services that is not receiving  periodic interim payments under paragraph (h) of this section if the  provider has experienced financial difficulties due to a delay by the  contractor in making payments or in exceptional situations, in which the  provider has experienced a temporary delay in preparing and submitting  bills to the contractor beyond its normal billing cycle. Any such  payment must be approved first by the contractor and then by CMS. The  amount of the payment is computed as a percentage of the net  reimbursement for unbilled or unpaid covered services. Recovery of the  accelerated payment may be made by recoupment as provider bills are  processed or by direct payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Periodic interim payment method of reimbursement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Covered  services furnished before July 1, 1987. In addition to the regular  methods of interim payment on individual provider billings for covered  services, the periodic interim payment (PIP) method is available for  Part A hospital and SNF inpatient services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Covered services furnished on or after July 1, 1987. Effective  with claims received on or after July l, 1987, or as otherwise  specified, the periodic interim payment (PIP) method is available for  the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Part A inpatient services furnished in hospitals that are  excluded from the prospective payment systems, as specified in Sec.  412.1(a)(1) of this chapter under subpart B of part 412 of this  subchapter, or are paid under the prospective payment systems described  in subpart N, O, and P of part 412 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Part A services furnished in hospitals receiving payment in  accordance with a demonstration project authorized under section 402(a)  of Public Law 90-248 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-1) or section 222(a) of Public Law  92-603 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-1 (note)), or a State reimbursement control  system approved under section 1886(c) of the Act and subpart C of part  403 of this chapter, if that type of payment is specifically approved by  CMS as an integral part of the demonstration or control system. If that  type of payment is not an integral part of the demonstration or control  system, PIP is available for the hospital under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of  this section for hospitals excluded from the prospective payment systems  or under Sec. 412.116(b) of this chapter for prospective payment  hospitals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Part A SNF services furnished in cost reporting periods  beginning before July 1, 1998. (For services furnished in subsequent  cost reporting periods, see Sec. 413.350 regarding periodic interim  payments for skilled nursing facilities).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Part A services furnished in hospitals paid under the  prospective payment system, including distinct part psychiatric or  rehabilitation units, as described in Sec. 412.116(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Services furnished in a hospice as specified in part 418 of this  chapter. Payment on a PIP basis is described in Sec. 418.307 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Effective for payments made on or after July 1, 2004, inpatient  CAH services furnished by a CAH as specified in Sec. 413.70. Payment on  a PIP basis is described in Sec. 413.70(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any participating provider furnishing the services described in  paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section that establishes to the  satisfaction of the contractor that it meets the following requirements  may elect to be reimbursed under the PIP method, beginning with the  first month after its request that the contractor finds administratively  feasible:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The provider's estimated total Medicare reimbursement for  inpatient services is at least $25,000 a year computed under the PIP  formula or, in the case of an HHA, either its estimated--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Total Medicare reimbursement for Part A and Part B services is  at least $25,000 a year computed under the PIP formula; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Medicare reimbursement computed under the PIP formula is at  least 50 percent of estimated total allowable cost.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The provider has filed at least one completed Medicare cost  report accepted by the contractor as providing an accurate basis for  computation of program payment (except in the case of a provider  requesting reimbursement under the PIP method upon first entering the  Medicare program).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The provider has the continuing capability of maintaining in  its records the cost, charge, and statistical data needed to accurately  complete a Medicare cost report on a timely basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The contractor's approval of a provider's request for  reimbursement under the PIP method will be conditioned upon the  contractor's best judgment as to whether payment can be made to the  provider under the PIP method without undue risk of its resulting in an  overpayment because of greatly varying or substantially declining  Medicare utilization, inadequate billing practices, or other  circumstances. The contractor may terminate PIP reimbursement to a  provider at any time it determines that the provider no longer meets the  qualifying requirements or that the provider's experience under the PIP  method shows that proper payment cannot be made under this method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Payment will be made biweekly under the PIP method unless the  provider requests a longer fixed interval (not to exceed one month)  between payments. The payment amount will be computed by the contractor  to approximate, on the average, the cost of covered inpatient or home  health services furnished by the provider during the period for which  the payment is to be made, and each payment will be made two weeks after  the end of such period of services. Upon request, the contractor will,  if feasible, compute the provider's payments to recognize significant  seasonal variation in Medicare utilization of services on a quarterly  basis starting with the beginning of the provider's reporting year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A provider's PIP amount may be appropriately adjusted at any  time if the provider presents or the contractor otherwise obtains  evidence relating to the provider's costs or Medicare utilization that  warrants such adjustment. In addition, the contractor will recompute the  payment immediately upon completion of the desk review of a provider's  cost report and also at regular intervals not less often than quarterly.  The contractor may make a retroactive lump sum interim payment to a  provider, based upon an increase in its PIP amount, in order to bring  past interim payments for the provider's current cost reporting period  into line with the adjusted payment amount. The objective of contractor  monitoring of provider costs and utilization is to assure payments  approximating, as closely as possible, the reimbursement to be  determined at settlement for the cost reporting period. A significant  factor in evaluating the amount of the payment in terms of the  realization of the projected Medicare utilization of services is the  timely submittal to the contractor of completed admission and billing  forms. All providers must complete billings in detail under this method  as under regular interim payment procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Bankruptcy or insolvency of provider. If on the basis of  reliable evidence, the contractor has a valid basis for believing that,  with respect to a provider, proceedings have been or will shortly be  instituted in a State or Federal court for purposes of determining  whether such provider is insolvent or bankrupt under an appropriate  State or Federal law, any payments to the   provider will be adjusted by the contractor, notwithstanding any other  regulation or program instruction regarding the timing or manner of such  adjustments, to a level necessary to insure that no overpayment to the  provider is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Interest payments resulting from judicial review--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Application. If a provider of services seeks judicial review by a  Federal court (see Sec. 405.1877 of this chapter) of a decision  furnished by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board or subsequent  reversal, affirmation, or modification by the Secretary, the amount of  any award of such Federal court will be increased by interest payable by  the party against whom the judgment is made (see Sec. 413.153 for  treatment of interest). The interest begins to accrue on the first day  of the first month following the 180-day period described in Sec.  405.1835(a)(3)(i) or (a)(3)(ii) of this chapter, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amount due. Section 1878(f) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395oo(f),  authorizes a court to award interest in favor of the prevailing party on  any amount due as a result of the court's decision. If the contractor  withheld any portion of the amount in controversy prior to the date the  provider seeks judicial review by a Federal court, and the Medicare  program is the prevailing party, interest is payable by the provider  only on the amount not withheld. Similarly, if the Medicare program  seeks to recover amounts previously paid to a provider, and the provider  is the prevailing party, interest on the amounts previously paid to a  provider is not payable by the Medicare program since that amount had  been paid and is not due the provider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rate. The amount of interest to be paid is equal to the rate of  return on equity capital (see Sec. 413.157) in effect for the month in  which the civil action is commenced.</p><p class="depth3">Example: An contractor made a final determination on the amount of  Medicare program reimbursement on June 15, 1974, and the provider  appealed that determination to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.  The Board heard the appeal and rendered a decision adverse to the  provider. On October 28, 1974, the provider commenced civil action to  have such decision reviewed. The rate of return on equity capital for  the month of October 1974 was 11.625 percent. The period for which  interest is computed begins on January 1, 1975, and the interest  beginning January 1, 1975, would be at the rate of 11.625 percent per  annum.
