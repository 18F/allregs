A mere change of purpose  after the payment of a fee will not entitle a party to a refund of such  fee. The Office will not refund amounts of twenty-five dollars or less  unless a refund is specifically   requested and will not notify the payor of such amounts. If the payor or  party requesting a refund does not provide the banking information  necessary for making refunds by electronic funds transfer, the Office  may use the banking information provided on the payment instrument to  make any refund by electronic funds transfer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, any request for  refund based upon such charge must be filed within two years from the  date of the deposit account statement indicating such charge and include  a copy of that deposit account statement.
