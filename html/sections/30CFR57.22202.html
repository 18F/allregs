The area of the doors or weak-wall shall be at least equivalent to the average cross-sectional area of the airway.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> (1) All main fan-related electrical equipment and cables located within or exposed to the forward or reverse airstream shall be approved by MSHA under the appliable requirements of 30 CFR part 18;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All main fan-related electrical equipment and cables located within or exposed to the forward or reverse airstream shall be approved by MSHA under the appliable requirements of 30 CFR part 18;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drive belts and nonmetallic fan blades shall be constructed of static-conducting material; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Aluminum alloy fan blades shall not contain more than 0.5 percent magnesium.
