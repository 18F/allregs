The Exchange will ensure that re-enrollment in coverage under this paragraph (j)(2) occurs as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The enrollee will be re-enrolled in a plan through the Exchange at the same metal level as the enrollee's current QHP in the product offered by the same issuer that is the most similar to the enrollee's current product;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the issuer does not offer another plan through the Exchange at the same metal level as the enrollee's current QHP, the enrollee will be re-enrolled in a plan through the Exchange that is one metal level higher or lower than the enrollee's current QHP in the product offered by the same issuer through the Exchange that is the most similar to the enrollee's current product; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the issuer does not offer another plan through the Exchange at the same metal level as, or one metal level higher or lower than the enrollee's current QHP, the enrollee will be re-enrolled in any other plan offered through the Exchange by the same issuer in which the enrollee is eligible to enroll.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Authorization of the release of tax data to support annual redetermination.

To the extent that a qualified individual has requested an eligibility determination for insurance affordability programs in accordance with Sec. 155.310(b) and the Exchange does not have an active authorization to obtain tax data as a part of the annual redetermination process, the Exchange must redetermine the qualified individual's eligibility only for enrollment in a QHP and notify the enrollee in accordance with the timing described in paragraph (d) of this section. The Exchange may not proceed with a redetermination for insurance affordability programs until such authorization has been obtained or the qualified individual continues his or her request for an eligibility determination for insurance affordability programs in accordance with Sec. 155.310(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Special rule. The Exchange must not redetermine a qualified individual's eligibility in accordance with this section if the qualified individual's eligibility was redetermined under this section during the prior year, and the qualified individual was not enrolled in a QHP through the Exchange at the time of such redetermination, and has not enrolled in a QHP through the Exchange since such redetermination.
