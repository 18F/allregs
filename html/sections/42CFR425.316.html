The results of these analyses  may subsequently require further investigation and follow-up with  beneficiaries or the ACO and its ACO participants, ACO providers/ suppliers, or other individuals or entities performing functions or  services related to the ACO's activities, in order to substantiate cases  of beneficiary avoidance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> CMS, at its sole discretion, may take any of the pre- termination actions set forth in Sec. 425.216(a)(1) or immediately  terminate, if it determines that an ACO, its ACO participants, any ACO  providers/suppliers, or other individuals or entities performing  functions or services related to the ACO's activities avoids at-risk  beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If CMS requires the ACO to submit a CAP, the ACO will--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Submit a CAP that addresses actions the ACO will take to ensure  that the ACO, ACO participants, ACO providers/suppliers, or other  individuals or entities performing functions or services related to the  ACO's activities cease avoidance of at-risk beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Not receive any shared savings payments during the time it is  under the CAP.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Not be eligible to receive shared savings for the performance  year attributable to the time that necessitated the CAP (the time period  during which the ACO avoided at risk beneficiaries).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> CMS will re-evaluate the ACO during and after the CAP  implementation period to determine if the ACO has continued to avoid at- risk beneficiaries.

To  identify ACOs that are not meeting the quality performance standards,  CMS will review an ACO's submission of quality measurement data under  Sec. 425.500. CMS may request additional documentation from an ACO, ACO  participants, or ACO providers/suppliers, as appropriate. If an ACO does  not meet quality performance standards or fails to report on one or more  quality measures, in addition to actions set forth at Sec. 425.216 and  Sec. 425.218, CMS will take the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ACO may be given a warning for the first time it fails to  meet the minimum attainment level in one or more domains as determined  under Sec. 425.502 and may be subject to a CAP.

If the ACO continues to fail to meet  quality performance standards in the following year, the agreement will  be terminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An ACO will not qualify to share in savings in any year it fails  to report accurately, completely, and timely on the quality performance  measures.
