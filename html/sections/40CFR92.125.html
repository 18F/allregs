Couple the engine to the dynamometer or locomotive alternator/generator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Start cooling system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Operate the engine until it has reached the specified operating  temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Establish that the temperature of intake air entering the engine  after compression and cooling in the charge air cooler(s), at each test  point, is within [5 F of the temperatures which occur in locomotive  operations at the ambient temperature represented by the test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Both locomotive and engine testing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Allow a minimum of 30  minutes warm-up in the stand-by or operating mode prior to spanning the  analyzers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Replace or clean filter elements (sampling and analytical  systems) as necessary, and then vacuum leak check the system,  Sec. 92.118. A pressure leak check is also permitted per Sec. 92.118.  Allow the heated sample line, filters, and pumps to reach operating  temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Perform the following system checks:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a stainless steel NO2 to NO converter is used,  purge the converter with air (zero-grade air, room air, or  O2) for a minimum of 30 minutes. The converter must be at  operational temperature while purging.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Check the sample system temperatures (see Sec. 92.114).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Check the system response time (see Sec. 92.118). System  response time   may be applied from the most recent check of response time if all of the  following are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The flow rate for each flow meter is equal to or greater than  the flow rate recorded in Sec. 92.118.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For analyzers with capillaries, the response time from the  sample/span valve is measured using in-use pressures and bypass flows  (see Sec. 92.118).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The response time measured in step in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)  of this section is equal to or less than the slowest response time  determined for Capillary flow analyzers in Sec. 92.118 plus 2 seconds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A hang-up check is permitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A converter-efficiency check is permitted. The check need not  conform to Sec. 92.121. The test procedure may be aborted at this point  in the procedure in order to repair the NO2 to NO converter.  If the test is aborted, the converter must pass the efficiency check  described in Sec. 92.121 prior to starting the test run.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Introduce the zero-grade gases at the same flow rates and  pressures used to calibrate the analyzers and zero the analyzers on the  lowest anticipated range that will be used during the test. Immediately  prior to each test, obtain a stable zero for each anticipated range that  will be used during the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Introduce span gases to the instruments under the same flow  conditions as were used for the zero gases. Adjust the instrument gains  on the lowest range that will be used to give the desired value. Span  gases should have a concentration greater than 70 percent of full scale  for each range used. Immediately prior to each test, record the response  to the span gas and the span-gas concentration for each range that will  be used during the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Check the zero responses. If they have changed more than 0.5  percent of full scale, repeat paragraphs (c)(4) and (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Check system flow rates and pressures. Note the values of gauges  for reference during the test.</p>
