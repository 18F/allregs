                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Act effects a significant degree of decentralization of  administration relative to the disposal of foreign gifts and decorations  which become U.S. Government property. Each agency is now responsible  for receiving from its employees deposits of foreign gifts of more than  minimal value, as well as of foreign decorations not meeting the  statutory criteria for retention by the recipient. The agency is also  responsible for disposing of this property by return to the donor, for  retaining it in the agency if official use of it is approved, for  reporting to the General Services Administration within 30 calendar days  after deposit items neither disposed of nor retained, and for assuming  custody, proper care and handling of such property pending removal from  that custody pursuant to disposal arrangements by the General Services  Administration. The Secretary of State, however, is made responsible for  providing guidance to other executive agencies in the development of  their own regulations to implement the Act, as well as for the annual  publication of lists of all gifts of more than minimal value deposited  by Federal employees during the preceding year. [See Sec. 3.5(c).]  Authority for the discharge of the Secretary's responsibilities is  delegated by these regulations to the Chief of Protocol.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Office of the Chief of Protocol retains primary  responsibility for administration of the Act within the Department of  State. That Office will, however, serve as the depository only for those  foreign gifts and decorations which are turned in by State Department  employees. The Director of Personnel Services of the USICA will have  responsibility for administration of the Act within that agency and will  serve as the depository of foreign gifts and decorations. Employees of  the other   foreign affairs agencies must deposit with their respective agencies any  gifts or decorations deposit of which is required by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any questions concerning the implementation of these regulations  or interpretation of the law should be directed to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the Department of State, to the Office of Protocol or to the  Office of the Assistant Legal Adviser for Management, as appropriate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For IDCA, to the Office of the General Counsel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For AID, to the Assistant General Counsel for Employee and  Public Affairs; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For USICA, to the General Counsel.</p>
