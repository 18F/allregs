To qualify, it must submit information  regarding its ability to provide this assistance. If approved, the grant  agreement will establish the terms and conditions for the grant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Number and amount of grants. In each year of the Microloan  Program, SBA may make no more than 55 grants to non-Intermediaries for  terms of up to five years. A grant may not exceed $200,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contribution by nonprofit entity. The nonprofit entity must  contribute an amount equal to 20 percent of the grant.
