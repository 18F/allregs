The  confidential or trade secret status of any information shall not,  however, preclude its being   introduced into evidence. The administrative law judge may make such  orders as may be necessary to consider such evidence in camera. This may  include a supplemental initial decision to consider questions of fact  and conclusions regarding material issues of law, fact or discretion  which arise out of that portion of the evidence which is confidential or  which includes trade secrets.</p>
