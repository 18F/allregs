                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A tympanic membrane contact hearing aid is a prescription device that compensates for impaired hearing. Amplified sound is transmitted by vibrating the tympanic membrane through a transducer that is in direct contact with the tympanic membrane.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The patient contacting components must be demonstrated to be biocompatible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Non-clinical performance testing must demonstrate that the device performs as intended under anticipated conditions of use, and must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mechanical integrity testing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Electrical and thermal safety testing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Software verification, validation, and hazard analysis;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Reliability testing consistent with expected device life;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Electromagnetic compatibility testing; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Validation testing of device output and mechanical force applied to the tympanic membrane in a clinically appropriate model.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Clinical performance testing must characterize any adverse events observed during clinical use, and demonstrate that the device performs as intended under anticipated conditions of use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Professional training must include the ear impression procedure, correct placement, fitting, monitoring, care, and maintenance of the device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Labeling must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A detailed summary of the adverse events and effectiveness outcomes from the clinical performance testing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Detailed instructions on how to fit the device to the patient;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Instructions for periodic cleaning of any reusable components;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Information related to electromagnetic compatibility; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Patient labeling that includes:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A patient card that identifies if a patient has been fitted with any non-self- removable components of the device and provides relevant information in cases of emergency;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Information on how to correctly use and maintain the device;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The potential risks and benefits associated with the use of the device; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Alternative treatments.
