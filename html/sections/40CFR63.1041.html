                            <p class="depth0">All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them  in the Act and in this section. If a term is defined in both this  section and in another subpart that references the use of this subpart,  then the definition in this subpart shall take precedence when  implementing this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Closure device means a cap, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other  type of fitting that, when the device is secured in the closed position,  prevents or reduces air emissions to the atmosphere by blocking an  opening in a fixed roof or floating roof. Closure devices include  devices that are detachable from the cover (e.g., a sampling port cap),  manually operated (e.g., a hinged access lid or hatch), or automatically  operated (e.g., a spring-loaded pressure relief valve).</p><p class="depth0">Continuous seal means a seal that forms a continuous closure that  completely covers the space between the edge of the floating roof and  the wall of a separator. A continuous seal may be constructed of  fastened segments so as to form a continuous seal.</p><p class="depth0">Fixed roof means a cover that is mounted on a separator in a  stationary position and does not move with fluctuations in the level of  the liquid managed in the separator.</p><p class="depth0">Floating roof means a pontoon-type or double-deck type cover that  rests upon and is supported by the liquid managed in a separator.</p><p class="depth0">Liquid-mounted seal means a foam- or liquid-filled continuous seal  that is mounted between the wall of the separator and the floating roof,  and the seal is in contact with the liquid in a separator.</p><p class="depth0">Oil-water separator means a separator as defined for this subpart  that is used to separate oil from water.</p><p class="depth0">Organic-water separator means a separator as defined for this  subpart that is used to separate organics from water.</p><p class="depth0">Metallic shoe seal means a continuous seal that is constructed of  metal sheets which are held vertically against the wall of the separator  by springs, weighted levers, or other mechanisms and is connected to the  floating roof by braces or other means. A flexible coated fabric  (envelope) spans the annular space between the metal sheet and the  floating roof.</p><p class="depth0">No detectable organic emissions means no escape of organics to the  atmosphere as determined using the procedure specified in Sec.   63.1046(a) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Regulated-material means the material (e.g. waste, wastewater, off- site material) required to be managed in separators using air emission  controls in accordance with the standards specified in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief  valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which  functions to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to  equipment by venting gases or vapors during unsafe conditions resulting  from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purpose of  this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases  or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during  filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this vapor headspace in  response to   normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device  is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and  open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter,  exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the equipment as  determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer  recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention  codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements  for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or  hazardous materials.</p><p class="depth0">Separator means a waste management unit, generally a tank, that is  used to separate oil or organics from water. A separator consists of not  only the separation unit but also the forebay and other separator  basins, skimmers, weirs, grit chambers, sludge hoppers, and bar screens  that are located directly after the individual drain system and prior to  any additional treatment units such as an air flotation unit clarifier  or biological treatment unit. Examples of a separator include an API  separator, parallel-plate interceptor, and corrugated-plate interceptor  with the associated ancillary equipment.
