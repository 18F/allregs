With respect to polymers, more than one recipe may be used to produce the same product. As an example, styrene acrylonitrile resin and methyl methacrylate butadiene styrene resin each represent a different product. Product also means a chemical that is not a polymer, that is manufactured by a process unit. By-products, isolated intermediates, impurities, wastes, and trace contaminants are not considered products.</p><p class="depth2">Raw materials preparation section means the equipment at a polymer manufacturing plant designed to prepare raw materials, such as monomers and solvents, for polymerization.

For purposes of the wastewater provisions of Sec.  63.1330, shutdown does not include the routine rinsing or washing of equipment in batch operation between batches. For purposes of the batch process vent provisions in Sec. Sec.  63.1321 through 63.1327, the cessation of equipment in batch operation is not a shutdown, unless the equipment undergoes maintenance, is replaced, or is repaired.</p><p class="depth2">Solid state polymerization process means a unit operation which, through the application of heat, furthers the polymerization (i.e., increases the intrinsic viscosity) of polymer chips.</p><p class="depth2">Start-up means the setting into operation of an affected source, a TPPU(s) within an affected source, a waste management unit or unit operation within an affected source, or equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, or a storage vessel after emptying and degassing. For both continuous and batch processes, start-up includes initial start-up and operation solely for testing equipment. For both continuous and batch processes, start-up does not include the recharging of equipment in batch operation. For continuous processes, start-up includes transitional conditions due to changes in product for flexible operation units. For batch processes, start-up does not include transitional conditions due to changes in product for flexible operation units.</p><p class="depth2">Steady-state conditions means that all variables (temperatures, pressures, volumes, flow rates, etc.) in a process do not vary significantly with time; minor fluctuations about constant mean values may occur.</p><p class="depth2">Storage vessel means a tank or other vessel that is used to store liquids that contain one or more organic HAP. Storage vessels do not include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> Vessels permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, railcars, barges, or ships;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> Vessels with capacities smaller than 38 cubic meters;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(4)</em> Vessels and equipment storing and/or handling material that contains no organic HAP and/or organic HAP as impurities only;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(5)</em> Wastewater storage tanks; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(6)</em> Surge control vessels and bottoms receivers.</p><p class="depth2">Styrene acrylonitrile resin (SAN) means copolymers consisting primarily of styrene and acrylonitrile monomer units.</p><p class="depth2">Supplemental combustion air means the air that is added to a vent stream after the vent stream leaves the unit operation. Air that is part of the vent stream as a result of the nature of the unit operation is not considered supplemental combustion air. Air required to operate combustion device burner(s) is not considered supplemental combustion air. Air required to ensure the proper operation of catalytic oxidizers, to include the intermittent addition of air upstream of the catalyst bed to maintain a minimum threshold flow rate through the catalyst bed or to avoid excessive temperatures in the catalyst bed, is not considered to be supplemental combustion air.</p><p class="depth2">Suspension process means a polymerization process where the monomer(s) is in a state of suspension, with the help of suspending agents, in a medium other than water (typically an organic solvent). The resulting polymers are not soluble in the reactor medium.</p><p class="depth2">Thermoplastic product means one of the following types of products:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> ABS latex;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> ABS using a batch emulsion process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> ABS using a batch suspension process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(4)</em> ABS using a continuous emulsion process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(5)</em> ABS using a continuous mass process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(6)</em> ASA/AMSAN;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(7)</em> EPS;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(8)</em> MABS;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(9)</em> MBS;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(10)</em> nitrile resin;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(11)</em> PET using a batch dimethyl terephthalate process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(12)</em> PET using a batch terephthalic acid process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(13)</em> PET using a continuous dimethyl terephthalate process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(14)</em> PET using a continuous terephthalic acid process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(15)</em> PET using a continuous terephthalic acid high viscosity multiple end finisher process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(16)</em> Polystyrene resin using a batch process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(17)</em> Polystyrene resin using a continuous process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(18)</em> SAN using a batch process; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(19)</em> SAN using a continuous process.</p><p class="depth2">Thermoplastic product process unit (TPPU) means a collection of equipment assembled and connected by hard-piping or ductwork, used to process raw materials and to manufacture a thermoplastic product as its primary product. This collection of equipment includes unit operations; recovery operations equipment, process vents; equipment identified in Sec.  63.149; storage vessels, as determined in Sec.  63.1310(g); and the equipment that is subject to the equipment leak provisions as specified in Sec.  63.1331. Utilities, lines and equipment not containing process fluids, and other non-process lines, such as heating and cooling systems which do not combine their materials with those in the processes they serve, are not part of the thermoplastic product process unit. A thermoplastic product process unit consists of more than one unit operation.</p><p class="depth2">Total organic compounds (TOC) means those compounds excluding methane and ethane measured according to the procedures of Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth2">Total resource effectiveness index value or TRE index value means a measure of the supplemental total resource requirement per unit reduction organic HAP associated with a continuous process vent stream, based on vent stream flow rate, emission rate of organic HAP, net heating value, and corrosion properties (whether or not the continuous process vent stream contains halogenated compounds), as quantified by the equations given under Sec.  63.115.</p><p class="depth2">Vent stream, as used in reference to batch process vents, continuous process vents, and aggregate batch vent streams, means the emissions from one or more process vents.</p><p class="depth2">Waste management unit is defined in Sec.  63.111, except that where the definition in Sec.  63.111 uses the term ``chemical manufacturing process unit,'' the term ``TPPU'' shall apply for purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Wastewater means water that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> Contains either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(i)</em> An annual average concentration of organic HAP listed on Table 6 of this subpart, except for ethylene glycol, of at least 5 parts per million by weight and has an annual average flow rate of 0.02 liter per minute or greater; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(ii)</em> An annual average concentration of organic HAP listed on Table 6 of this subpart, except for ethylene glycol, of at least 10,000 parts per million by weight at any flow rate; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> Is discarded from a TPPU that is part of an affected source.
