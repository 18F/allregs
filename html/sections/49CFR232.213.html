                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A railroad may be permitted to move a train up to, but not  exceeding, 1,500 miles between brake tests and inspections if the  railroad designates a train as an extended haul train. In order for a  railroad to designate a train as an extended haul train, all of the  following requirements must be met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The railroad must designate the train in writing to FRA's  Associate Administrator for Safety. This designation must include the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The train identification symbol or identification of the  location where extended haul trains will originate and a description of  the trains that will be operated as extended haul trains from those  locations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The origination and destination points for the train;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The type or types of equipment the train will haul; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The locations where all train brake and mechanical inspections  and tests will be performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A Class I brake test pursuant to Sec. 232.205 shall be performed  at the initial terminal for the train by a qualified mechanical  inspector as defined in Sec. 232.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A freight car inspection pursuant to part 215 of this chapter  shall be performed at the initial terminal for the   train and shall be performed by an inspector designated under  Sec. 215.11 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All cars having conditions not in compliance with part 215 of  this chapter at the initial terminal for the train shall be either  repaired or removed from the train. Except for a car developing such a  condition en route, no car shall be moved pursuant to the provisions of  Sec. 215.9 of this chapter in the train.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The train shall have no more than one pick-up and one set-out en  route, except for the set-out of defective equipment pursuant to the  requirements of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cars added to the train en route shall be inspected pursuant to  the requirements contained in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this  section at the location where they are added to the train.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cars set out of the train en route shall be inspected pursuant  to the requirements contained in paragraph (a)(6) of this section at the  location where they are set out of the train.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In order for an extended haul train to proceed beyond 1,500  miles, the following requirements shall be met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the train will move 1,000 miles or less from that location  before receiving a Class IA brake test or reaching destination, a Class  I brake test shall be conducted pursuant to Sec. 232.205 to ensure 100  percent effective and operative brakes. The inbound inspection required  by paragraph (a)(6) of this section may be used to meet this requirement  provided it encompasses all the inspection elements contained in  Sec. 232.205.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the train will move greater than 1,000 miles from that  location without another brake inspection, the train must be identified  as an extended haul train for that movement and shall meet all the  requirements contained in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this  section. Such trains shall receive a Class I brake test pursuant to  Sec. 232.205 by a qualified mechanical inspector to ensure 100 percent  effective and operative brakes, a freight car inspection pursuant to  part 215 of this chapter by an inspector designated under Sec. 215.11 of  this chapter, and all cars containing non-complying conditions under  part 215 of this chapter shall either be repaired or removed from the  train. The inbound inspection required by paragraph (a)(6) of this  section may be used to meet these inspection requirements provided it  encompasses all the inspection elements contained paragraphs (a)(2)  through (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> FRA inspectors shall have physical access to visually observe  all brake and freight car inspections and tests required by this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Failure to comply with any of the requirements contained in  paragraph (a) of this section will be considered an improper movement of  a designated priority train for which appropriate civil penalties may be  assessed as outlined in appendix A to this part. Furthermore, FRA's  Associate Administrator for Safety may revoke a railroad's ability to  designate any or all trains as extended haul trains for repeated or  willful noncompliance with any of the requirements contained in this  section. Such a determination will be made in writing and will state the  basis for such action.  [66 FR 4193, Jan. 17, 2001, as amended at 67 FR 17583, Apr. 10, 2002; 73  FR 61553, Oct. 16, 2008]</p>
