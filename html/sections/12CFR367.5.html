                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Ethics Counselor may exclude a contractor from the FDIC contracting program for any of the causes set forth in Sec. 367.6, using procedures established in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exclusion is a serious action to be imposed when there exists a preponderance of the evidence that a contractor has violated one or more of the causes set forth in Sec. 367.6. Contractors excluded from FDIC contracting programs are prohibited from entering into any new contracts with FDIC for the duration of the period of exclusion as determined pursuant to this part. The FDIC shall not solicit offers from, award contracts to, extend or modify existing contracts, award task orders under existing contracts, or consent to subcontracts with such contractors. Excluded contractors are also prohibited from conducting business with FDIC as agents or representatives of other contractors. Provided however, that these limitations do not become effective upon the notification of the contractor that there is a possible

cause to exclude under Sec. 367.13. Rather, they become effective only upon the Ethics Counselor's decision to exclude the contractor pursuant to Sec. 367.16. Provided further, that the causes for exclusion set forth in Sec. 367.6(a)(1) through (4) reflect statutorily established mandatory bars to contracting with the FDIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except when one or more of the statutorily established mandatory bars to contracting are shown to exist, the existence of a cause for exclusion does not necessarily require that the contractor be excluded; the seriousness of the contractor's acts or omissions and any mitigating or aggravating circumstances shall be considered in making any exclusion decision.</p>
