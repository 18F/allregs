                            <p class="depth0">This table may be used to ascertain the weight of any given number  of wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) or proof gallons of spirits  by multiplying the pounds per gallon by the given number of gallons of  the spirits. The table should be especially useful where   it is desired to weigh a precise quantity of spirits.</p><p class="depth0">Example. It is desired to ascertain the weight of 100 wine gallons  of 190 proof spirits:  6.79434x100 equals 679.43 pounds, net weight of 100 wine gallons of 190</p><p class="depth0">proofs spirits.</p><p class="depth0">Example. It is desired to ascertain the weight of 100 proof gallons  of 190 proof spirits.  3.57597x100 equals 357.60 pounds, net weight of 100 proof gallons of 190</p><p class="depth0">proof spirits.   The slight variation between this table and Tables 2 and 3 on some  calculations is due to dropping or adding of fractions beyond the first  decimal on those tables. This table also shows the weight per wine  gallon (at the prevailing temperature) corresponding to each uncorrected  reading of a proof hydrometer.  (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))</p>
