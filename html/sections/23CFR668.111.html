                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification. As soon as possible after the disaster, the  applicant shall notify the FHWA Division Administrator of its intent to  apply for ER funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Damage survey. As soon as practical after occurrence, the State  will make a preliminary field survey, working cooperatively with the  FHWA Division Administrator and other governmental agencies with  jurisdiction over eligible highways. The preliminary field survey should  be coordinated with the Federal Emergency Management Agency work, if  applicable, to eliminate duplication of effort. The purpose of this  survey is to determine the general nature and extent of damage to  eligible highways.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A damage survey summary report is to be prepared by the State.  The purpose of the damage survey summary report is to provide a factual  basis for the FHWA Division Administrator's finding that serious damage  to Federal-aid highways has been caused by a natural disaster over a  wide area or a catastrophe. The damage survey summary report should  include by political subdivision or other generally recognized  administrative or geographic boundaries, a description of the types and  extent of damage to highways and a preliminary estimate of cost of  restoration or reconstruction for damaged Federal-aid highways in each  jurisdiction. Pictures showing the kinds and extent of damage and sketch  maps detailing the damaged areas should be included, as appropriate, in  the damage survey summary report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless very unusual circumstances prevail, the damage survey  summary report should be prepared within 6 weeks following the  applicant's notification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For large disasters where extensive damage to Federal-aid  highways is readily evident, the FHWA Division Administrator may approve  an application under Sec. 668.111(d) prior to submission of the damage  survey summary report. In these cases, an abbreviated   damage survey summary report, summarizing eligible repair costs by  jurisdiction, is to be prepared and submitted to the FHWA Division  Administrator after the damage inspections have been completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application. Before funds can be made available, an application  for ER must be made to, and approved by the FHWA Division Administrator.  The application shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A copy of the Governor's proclamation, request for a  Presidential declaration, or a Presidential declaration; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A copy of the damage survey summary report, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Approval of application. The FHWA Division Administrator's  approval of the application constitutes the finding of eligibility under  23 U.S.C. 125 and shall constitute approval of the application.
