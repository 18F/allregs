                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Interpretation of spirometry examinations. Interpretations will  be carried out by physicians or other qualified health care  professionals with expertise in spirometry who have all required  licensure and privileges to provide this service in their State or  Territory. Interpretations must be carried out using procedures and  criteria consistent with recommendations in the ATS Technical Standards:  Spirometry in the Occupational Setting, pp. 987-990, and the ATS/ERS  Interpretative Strategies for Lung Function Tests, p. 950, p. 956  including Table 5, and p. 957 including Table 6 (both incorporated by  reference, see Sec.  37.97).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Spirometry test reports at the facilities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Spirometry test  reports must contain, at a minimum, the miner's age, height, gender,  race, and weight, numerical values (FVC, FEV6, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEV1/ FEV6, FET, and PEF) and volume-time and flow-volume spirograms for all  recorded expiratory maneuvers, normal reference value set used, the  predicted, percent predicted and lower limit of normal values, miner  position during testing (standing or sitting), dates of test and last  calibration check, ambient temperature and barometric pressure (volume  spirometers), and the technician's unique identification number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> NIOSH will notify the submitting facility when to permanently  delete or, if this is not technologically feasible for the spirometry  system used, render permanently inaccessible all files and forms  associated with a miner's spirometry examination from its electronic and  physical files.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notifying miners of spirometry examination results. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Findings  must be communicated to the miner or, if requested by the miner, to the  miner's designated physician. The health care professional at the NIOSH- approved facility must inform the miner if the spirometry examination  shows abnormal results or if the respiratory assessment suggests he or  she may benefit from the medical follow-up or a smoking cessation  intervention.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> NIOSH will notify the miner of his or her spirometry examination  results and the results of a comparison between current and previously  submitted spirometry examinations and will advise the miner to contact a  health care professional as appropriate based on the results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Submission of results. Each facility must submit spirometry  results and completed forms to NIOSH within 14 days after a miner has  received an examination under this subpart. If specified under a  facility's approval, it must submit spirometry results and the completed  Respiratory Assessment Form (Form CDC/NIOSH (M)2.13) and Spirometry  Notification Form (Form CDC/NIOSH (M)2.16), available at http://   www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/surveillance/ords/ CoalWorkersHealthSurvProgram.html, via electronic transmission.  Facilities must utilize a secure internet data transfer site specified  by NIOSH. The transmitted spirometry data files must include a variable  length record providing all parameters in the format, content, and data  structure described by the 2005 ATS/ERS Standardisation of Spirometry,  p. 335 including Table 8 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  37.97),  or an alternate data file that is approved by NIOSH. If electronic  transmission of spirometry results is not possible, for example if a  facility's spirometer does not provide an approved electronic transfer  of spirometry files, then the miner's Spirometry Results Form (Form CDC/ NIOSH (M)2.17), available at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ surveillance/ords/CoalWorkersHealthSurvProgram.html, must be completed  and submitted accompanied by image files documenting the flow-volume and  volume time curves for each trial reported on the Results Form. Such  facilities must also send a completed Respiratory Assessment Form (Form  CDC/NIOSH (M)2.13) and Spirometry Notification Form (Form CDC/NIOSH  (M)2.16). Data submission to NIOSH by such a facility must be carried  out as specified in the facility's approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Confidentiality of spirometry examinations. Individual medical  information and spirometry results are considered protected health  information under HIPAA and may only be released as specified by HIPAA  or to NIOSH as specified in Sec. Sec.  37.93 and 37.96 of this subpart.  Personally identifiable information in the possession of NIOSH will be  released only with the written consent of the miner or, if the miner is  deceased, the written consent of the miner's next of kin or legal  representative. To provide on-site back-up and assure complete data  transfer, facilities will retain the forms and results (in electronic or  paper format) from a miner's examination until instruction has been  received from NIOSH to delete the associated files and forms or, if this  is not technologically feasible, render the data permanently  inaccessible.</p>
