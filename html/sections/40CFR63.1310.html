The owner or operator of a flexible operation unit that was not initially designated as a TPPU, but in which a thermoplastic product is produced, shall conduct an annual re-determination of the applicability of this subpart in accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Owners or operators that anticipate the production of a thermoplastic product in a process unit that was not initially designated as a TPPU, and in which no thermoplastic products are currently produced, shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in accordance with paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(5) through (f)(7) of this section discuss compliance only for flexible operation units. Other paragraphs apply to all process units, including flexible operation units, unless otherwise noted.

If the process unit never uses or manufactures any organic HAP, regardless of the outcome of the primary product determination, the only requirements of this subpart that might apply to the process unit are contained in paragraph (b) of this section. If a flexible operation unit does not use or manufacture any organic HAP during the manufacture of one or more products, paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section applies to that flexible operation unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a process unit only manufactures one product, then that product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a process unit produces more than one intended product at the same time, the primary product shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The product for which the process unit has the greatest annual design capacity on a mass basis shall represent the primary product of the process unit, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If a process unit has the same maximum annual design capacity on a mass basis for two or more products, and if one of those products is a thermoplastic product, then the thermoplastic product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a process unit is designed and operated as a flexible operation unit, the primary product shall be determined as specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section based on the anticipated operations for the 5 years following September 12, 1996 at

existing process units, or for the first year after the process unit begins production of any product for new process units.

For a process unit that is designated as a TPPU in accordance with this paragraph, the thermoplastic product that will be produced shall be designated as the primary product of the TPPU. If more than one thermoplastic product will be produced, the owner or

operator may select which thermoplastic product is designated as the primary product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Annual applicability determination for non-TPPUs that have produced a thermoplastic product.

The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator, with all necessary supporting documentation, that explains how it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (k)(1) of this section. This affirmative defense report shall be included in the first periodic compliance report, deviation report, or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance report, deviation report, or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmative defense report may be included in the second compliance report, deviation report, or excess emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.[61 FR 48229, Sept. 12, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 38094, June 19, 2000; 66 FR 36937, July 16, 2001; 71 FR 20460, Apr. 20, 2006; 79 FR 17363, Mar. 27, 2014]</p>
