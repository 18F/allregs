The resulting  emission point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of  initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in  Sec.  63.1311 (i.e., February 27, 1998 for most equipment leak  components subject to Sec.  63.1331, and June 19, 2001 for most emission  points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If any process change (not including a process change that  solely replaces components) is made to an existing affected source that  results in baseline emissions (i.e., emissions prior to applying  controls for purposes of complying with this subpart) from continuous  process vents in the collection of material recovery sections within the  affected source at an existing affected source producing PET using a  continuous dimethyl terephthalate process changing from less than or  equal to 0.12 kg organic HAP per Mg of product to greater than 0.12 kg  organic HAP per Mg of product, the continuous process vents shall be  subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected source.  The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 days after  the date of initial start-up or by June 19, 2001, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Existing affected source requirements for surge control vessels  and bottoms receivers that become subject to subpart H requirements. If  a process change or addition of an emission point causes a surge control  vessel or bottoms receiver to become subject to Sec.  63.170 under this  paragraph (i), the owner or operator shall be in compliance upon initial  start-up or by June 19, 2001, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determining what are and are not process changes. For purposes  of paragraph (i) of this section, examples of process changes include,  but are not limited to, changes in feedstock type, or process catalyst  type, or the replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment, or  equipment changes that increase production capacity. For purposes of  paragraph (i) of   this section, process changes do not include: Process upsets,  unintentional temporary process changes, and changes that do not alter  the equipment configuration and operating conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reporting requirements for owners or operators that change or  add to their plant site or affected source. Owners or operators that  change or add to their plant site or affected source, as discussed in  paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section, shall submit a report as  specified in Sec.  63.1335(e)(7)(iv).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Applicability of this subpart. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The emission limitations set  forth in this subpart and the emission limitations referred to in this  subpart shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation  of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in  cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The emission limitations set forth in subpart H of this part, as  referred to in Sec.  63.1331, shall apply at all times except during  periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion  thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized, resulting in  cessation of the emissions to which Sec.  63.1331 applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment  that are required or utilized for compliance with this subpart during  times when emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or  residuals) are being routed to such items of equipment, if the shutdown  would contravene requirements of this subpart applicable to such items  of equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> General duty. At all times, the owner or operator must operate  and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution  control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with  safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing  emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the  owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if  levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved.  Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with  operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information  available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited  to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures,  review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the  source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Affirmative defense for violation of emission standards during  malfunction. In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth  in this subpart, the owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense  to a claim for civil penalties for violations of such standards that are  caused by malfunction, as defined at Sec.  63.2. Appropriate penalties  may be assessed if the owner or operator fails to meet their burden of  proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense. The  affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive  relief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assertion of affirmative defense. To establish the affirmative  defense in any action to enforce such a standard, the owner or operator  must timely meet the reporting requirements in paragraph (k)(2) of this  section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The violation:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of  air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to  operate in a normal or usual manner; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper  design or better operation and maintenance practices; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been  foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Was not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate  design, operation, or maintenance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when a violation  occurred; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The frequency, amount, and duration of the violation  (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or  a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,  personal injury, or severe property damage; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the  violation   on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in  operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air  pollution control practices; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> All of the actions in response to the violation were  documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner  consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of  which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the  malfunction and the violation resulting from the malfunction event at  issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods  and engineering judgment, the amount of any emissions that were the  result of the malfunction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Report. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative  defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator, with all  necessary supporting documentation, that explains how it has met the  requirements set forth in paragraph (k)(1) of this section. This  affirmative defense report shall be included in the first periodic  compliance report, deviation report, or excess emission report otherwise  required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant  standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If  such compliance report, deviation report, or excess emission report is  due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the  affirmative defense report may be included in the second compliance  report, deviation report, or excess emission report due after the  initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.
