                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cooking areas. Vertical or horizontal surfaces within 910  millimeters (3 feet) of cooking appliances must have an ASTM E-84  (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 175.600) flame spread rating of  not more than 75. Curtains, draperies, or free hanging fabrics must not  be fitted within 910 millimeters (3 feet) of cooking or heating  appliances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Composite materials. When the hull, bulkheads, decks, deckhouse,  or superstructure of a vessel is partially or completely constructed of  a composite material, including fiber reinforced plastic, the resin used  must be fire retardant and meet as accepted by the Commandant as meeting  NPFC MIL-R-21607E(SH) (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 175.600).  Resin systems that have not been accepted as meeting NPFC MIL-R- 21607E(SH) may be accepted as fire retardant if they have an ASTM E-84  flame spread rating of not more than 100 when tested in laminate form.  The laminate submitted for testing the resin system to ASTM E-84 must  meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test specimen laminate total thickness must be between 3.2  and 6.4 millimeters (\1/8\ to \1/4\ inch).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The test specimen laminate must be reinforced with glass fiber  of any form and must have a minimum resin content of 40 percent by  weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tests must be performed by an independent laboratory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Test results must include, at a minimum, the resin  manufacturer's name and address, the manufacturer's designation (part  number) for the resin system including any additives used, the test  laboratory's name and address, the test specimen laminate schedule, and  the flame spread index resulting from the ASTM E-84 test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Specific laminate schedules, regardless of resin type, that have  an ASTM E-84 flame spread rating of not more than 100 may be considered  as equivalent to the requirement in this section to use a fire retardant  resin. Requests for qualifying a specific laminate schedule as fire  retardant for use in a particular vessel may be submitted for  consideration by visitors to the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety  Center, U.S. Coast Guard, 4200 Wilson Boulevard Suite 400, Arlington, VA  22203, or by mail to: Commanding Officer (MSC), Attn: Marine Safety  Center, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7410, 4200 Wilson Boulevard Suite 400,  Arlington, VA 20598-7410, in a written or electronic format. Information  for submitting the VSP electronically can be found at http:// www.uscg.mil/HQ/MSC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of general purpose resin. General purpose resins may be used  instead of fire retardant resins if the following additional  requirements are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cooking and heating appliances. Galleys must be surrounded by B- 15 Class fire boundaries. This may not apply to concession stands that  are not considered high fire hazards areas (galleys) as long as they do  not contain medium to high heat appliances such as deep fat fryers, flat  plate griddles, and open ranges with heating surfaces exceeding 121  [deg]C (250 [deg]F). Open flame systems for cooking and heating are not  allowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sources of ignition. Electrical equipment and switch boards must  be protected from fuel or water sources. Fuel lines and hoses must be  located as far as practical from heat sources. Internal combustion  engine exhausts, boiler and galley uptakes, and similar   sources of ignition must be kept clear of and suitability insulated from  any woodwork or other combustible matter. Internal combustion engine dry  exhaust systems must be installed in accordance with ABYC P-1  (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 175.600).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fire detection and extinguishing systems. Fire detection and  extinguishing systems must be installed in compliance with Sec. Sec.  181.400 through 181.420 of this chapter. Additionally, all fiber  reinforced plastic (FRP) vessels constructed with general purpose resins  must be fitted with a smoke activated fire detection system of an  approved type, installed in accordance with Sec. 76.27 in subchapter H  of this chapter, in all accommodation spaces, all service spaces, and in  isolated spaces such as voids and storage lockers that contain an  ignition source such as electric equipment or piping for a dry exhaust  system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Machinery space boundaries. Boundaries that separate machinery  spaces from accommodation spaces, service spaces, and control spaces  must be lined with noncombustible panels or insulation approved in  accordance with Sec. 164.009 in subchapter Q of this chapter, or other  standard specified by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Furnishings. Furniture and furnishings must comply with Sec.  116.423 in subchapter K of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitations on the use of general purpose resin--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Overnight  accommodations. Vessels with overnight passenger accommodations for more  than 12 persons must not be constructed with general purpose resin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Gasoline fuel systems. Vessels with engines powered by gasoline  or other fuels having a flash point of 43.3 [deg]C (110 [deg]F) or lower  must not be constructed with general purpose resin, except for vessels  powered by outboard engines with portable fuel tanks stored in an open  area aft, if, as determined by the cognizant OCMI, the arrangement does  not produce an unreasonable hazard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cargo. Vessels carrying or intended to carry hazardous  combustible or flammable cargo must not be constructed with general  purpose resin.
