Such cases will be identified in the guideline documents issued under Sec. 60.22.

Methods other than those specified in appendix A to this part may be specified in the plan if shown to be equivalent or alternative methods as defined in Sec. 60.2 (t) and (u).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Emission standards shall apply to all designated facilities within the State.
