                            <p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, no firearm may be  transferred in the United States unless an application, Form 4  (Firearms), Application for Transfer and Registration of Firearm, in  duplicate, executed under the penalties of perjury to transfer the  firearm and register it to the transferee has been filed with and  approved by the Director. The application, Form 4 (Firearms), shall be  filed by the transferor and shall identify the firearm to be transferred  by type; serial number; name and address of the manufacturer and  importer, if known; model; caliber, gauge or size; in the case of a  short-barreled shotgun or a short-barreled rifle, the length of the  barrel; in the case of a weapon made from a rifle or shotgun, the  overall length of the weapon and the length of the barrel; and any other  identifying marks on the firearm. In the event the firearm does not bear  a serial number, the applicant shall obtain a serial number from the  Special Agent in Charge and shall stamp (impress) or otherwise  conspicuously place such serial number on the firearm in a manner not  susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered or removed. The  application, Form 4 (Firearms), shall identify the transferor by name  and address; shall identify the transferor's Federal firearms license  and special (occupational) Chapter tax stamp, if any; and if the  transferor is other than a natural person, shall show the title or  status of the person executing the application. The application also  shall identify the transferee by name and address, and, if the  transferee is a natural person not qualified as a manufacturer, importer  or dealer under this part, he shall be further identified in the manner  prescribed in Sec. 479.85. The application also shall identify the  special (occupational) tax stamp and Federal firearms license of the  transferee, if any. Any tax payable on the transfer must be represented  by an adhesive stamp of proper denomination being affixed to the  application, Form 4 (Firearms), properly cancelled.  [36 FR 14256, Aug. 3, 1971.
