To enhance the ability of  PHAs to combat drug-related and violent crime within their developments,  Resident Councils (RCs), Resident Management Corporations (RMCs), and  Resident Organizations (ROs) will be permitted to undertake management  functions specified in this part, notwithstanding the otherwise  applicable requirements of part 964 of this title.
