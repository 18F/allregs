                            <p class="depth0">You must submit semiannual compliance reports for each affected source according to the requirements of this section. The semiannual compliance reporting requirements of this section may be satisfied by reports required under other parts of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unless the Administrator has approved a different schedule for submission of reports under Sec. 63.10(a), you must prepare and submit each semiannual compliance report according to the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The first semiannual compliance report must cover the first semiannual reporting period which begins the day after the end of the initial compliance period described in Sec. 63.4140, Sec. 63.4150, or Sec. 63.4160 that applies to your affected source and ends on June 30 or December 31, whichever date is the first date following the end of the initial compliance period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each subsequent semiannual compliance report must cover the subsequent semiannual reporting period from January 1 through June 30 or the

semiannual reporting period from July 1 through December 31.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each semiannual compliance report must be postmarked or delivered no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date is the first date following the end of the semiannual reporting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each affected source that is subject to permitting regulations pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, and if the permitting authority has established dates for submitting semiannual reports pursuant to 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), you may submit the first and subsequent semiannual compliance reports according to the dates the permitting authority has established instead of the date specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each affected source that has obtained a title V operating permit pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 must report all deviations as defined in this subpart in the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). If an affected source submits a semiannual compliance report pursuant to this section along with, or as part of, the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), and the semiannual compliance report includes all required information concerning deviations from any emission limitation in this subpart, its submission shall be deemed to satisfy any obligation to report the same deviations in the semiannual monitoring report. However, submission of a semiannual compliance report shall not otherwise affect any obligation the affected source may have to report deviations from permit requirements to the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The semiannual compliance report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section and the information specified in paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section that is applicable to your affected source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Company name and address.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statement by a responsible official with that official's name, title, and signature certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the content of the report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Date of report and beginning and ending dates of the reporting period.

If you switched between compliance options during the reporting period, you must report the beginning and ending dates you used each option.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If there were no deviations from the emission limitations in Sec. Sec. 63.4090, 63.4092, and 63.4093 that apply to you, the semiannual compliance report must include a statement that there were no deviations from the emission limitations during the reporting period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you use the compliant material option and there was a deviation from the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4090, the semiannual compliance report must contain the information in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of each coating used that deviated from the emission limit, each thinner and cleaning material used that contained organic HAP, and the dates and time periods each was used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The determination of the organic HAP content, according to Sec. 63.4141(d), for each coating identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. You do not need to submit background data supporting this calculation, for example, information provided by coating suppliers or manufacturers or test reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The determination of mass fraction of organic HAP for each thinner and cleaning material identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. You do not need to submit background data supporting this calculation, for example, information provided by material suppliers or manufacturers or test reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement of the cause of each deviation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you use the emission rate without add-on controls option and there was a deviation from the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4090, the semiannual compliance report must contain

the information in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The beginning and ending dates of each compliance period during which the organic HAP emission rate exceeded the emission limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The calculations used to determine the organic HAP emission rate for the compliance period in which the deviation occurred. You must provide the calculations for Equations 1, 1A through 1C, 2, and 3 in Sec. 63.4151; and, if applicable, the calculation used to determine the organic HAP in waste materials according to Sec. 63.4151(e)(4). You do not need to submit background data supporting these calculations, for example, information provided by materials suppliers or manufacturers or test reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement of the cause of each deviation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If you use the emission rate with add-on controls option and there were no periods during which the continuous parameter monitoring systems (CPMS) were out-of-control as specified in Sec. 63.8(c)(7), the semiannual compliance report must include a statement that there were no periods during which the CPMS were out-of-control during the reporting period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If you use the emission rate with add-on controls option and there was a deviation from an emission limitation (including any periods when emissions bypassed the add-on control device and were diverted to the atmosphere), the semiannual compliance report must contain the information in paragraphs (g)(1) through (14) of this section. This includes periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction during which deviations occurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The beginning and ending dates of each compliance period during which the organic HAP emission rate exceeded the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4090.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The calculations used to determine the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period in which a deviation occurred. You must provide the calculation of the total mass of organic HAP emissions for the coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used during the compliance period, using Equations 1, 1A through 1C, and 2 of Sec. 63.4151 and, if applicable, the calculation used to determine the mass of organic HAP in waste materials according to Sec. 63.4151(e)(4); the calculation of the total volume of coating solids used during the compliance period, using Equation 2 of Sec. 63.4151; the calculation of the mass of organic HAP emission reduction during the compliance period by emission capture systems and add-on control devices, using Equations 1, 1A through 1C, 2, 3, and 3A through 3C of Sec. 63.4161; and the calculation of the organic HAP emission rate, using Equation 4 of Sec. 63.4161.
