If OPM is unable to identify an administrative law judge under Sec. 930.208 who meets the agency's qualification requirements, OPM will approve the agency's request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An agency wishing to temporarily reemploy an administrative law judge must submit a written request to OPM. The request must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify the statutory authority under which the administrative law judge is expected to conduct proceedings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Demonstrate the agency's temporary or irregular workload requirements for conducting proceedings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify the tour of duty, location, period of time, or particular cases(s) for the requested reemployment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Describe any special qualifications the retired administrative law judge possesses that are required of the position, such as experience in a particular field, agency, or substantive area of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> OPM establishes the terms of the appointment for a senior administrative law judge.
