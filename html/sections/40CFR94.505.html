Each engine will be selected from the end of the production line. Testing shall be performed throughout the entire model year to the extent possible. Engines selected shall cover the broadest range of production possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> The required sample size for Category 1 engine manufacturers is one percent of projected annual U.S.-directed production for all Category 1 engine families, provided that no engine tested fails to meet applicable emission standards. Test engines shall include a proportional sample from each engine family. The required sample size is zero if a manufacturer's projected annual production for all Category 1 engine families is less than 100.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The required sample size for Category 1 engine manufacturers is one percent of projected annual U.S.-directed production for all Category 1 engine families, provided that no engine tested fails to meet applicable emission standards.
