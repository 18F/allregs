Any group of OCS installations interconnected with walkways, or any group of installations that includes a central or primary installation with one or more satellite or secondary installations, is a single facility. BOEM may decide that the complexity of the installations justifies their classification as separate facilities.</p><p class="depth2">Geographic center of a project means the centroid (geometric center point) of a qualified project area. The centroid represents the point that is the weighted average of coordinates of the same dimension within the mapping system, with the weights determined by the density function of the system.

If OCS acreage is granted for a project under some form of agreement other than a lease (i.e., a ROW, RUE, or Alternate Use RUE issued under this part), the Federal acreage granted would be considered the project area. To avoid distortions in the calculation of the geometric center of the project area, project easements issued under this part are not considered part of the qualified project's area.</p><p class="depth2">Project easement means an easement to which, upon approval of your Construction and Operations Plan (COP) or General Activities Plan (GAP), you are entitled as part of the lease for the purpose of installing, gathering, transmission, and distribution cables, pipelines, and appurtenances on the OCS as necessary for the full enjoyment of the lease.</p><p class="depth2">Renewable Energy means energy resources other than oil and gas and minerals as defined in 30 CFR part 580.
