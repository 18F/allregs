                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the  applicant must complete a separate market survey for each service area  where the applicant proposes to provide service at the broadband lending  speed. Each market survey must demonstrate the need for the service at  the broadband lending speed, support the projected penetration rates and  price points for the services to be offered, and support the feasibility  analysis. The market survey must also address all other services that  will be provided in connection with the broadband loan. Additional  information on the requirements of the market survey can be found in the  Application Guide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The applicant is not required to complete a market survey for  any service offering for which the applicant is projecting less than a  20 percent penetration rate in each service area by the end of the five- year forecast period. For example, if the applicant is projecting a  penetration rate of 30 percent for data services and 15 percent for  video services, a market survey must be completed for the data services.  The proposed prices for those services with a projected penetration rate  less than   20 percent must be affordable, as determined by the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For a market survey to be acceptable to the Agency, it must have  been completed within six months of the application submission date. The  Agency may reject any application in which the financial projections are  not supported by the market survey. If the demographics of the proposed  service area have significantly changed since the survey was completed,  the Agency may require an updated market survey.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Administrator may modify the requirements of this section  for loans in service areas that are underserved when it is in the best  interests of the Agency.</p>
