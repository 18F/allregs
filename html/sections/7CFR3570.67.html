The median household income of the population to be served by the proposed project is below the higher of the poverty line or:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 60 percent of the State nonmetropolitan median household income--30 points;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 70 percent of the State nonmetropolitan median household income--20 points;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 80 percent of the State nonmetropolitan median household income--10 points; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 90 percent of the State nonmetropolitan median household income--5 points.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other priorities.

(1) The State Director may assign up to 15 points to a project in addition to those that may be scored under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. These points are to address unforeseen exigencies or emergencies, such as the loss of a community facility due to an accident or natural disaster or the loss of joint financing if Agency funds are not committed in a timely fashion. In addition, the points will be awarded to projects benefiting from the leveraging of funds in order to improve compatibility and coordination between the Agency and other agencies' selection systems and for those projects that are the most cost effective.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State Director may assign up to 15 points to a project in addition to those that may be scored under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
