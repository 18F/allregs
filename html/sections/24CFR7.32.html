If the Complainant is an employee of the Department  and the Complainant designates another employee of the Department as the  Complainant's representative, the representative shall have a reasonable  amount of official time, if otherwise on duty, to prepare the complaint  and respond to Department and EEOC requests for information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department is not obligated to change work schedules, incur  overtime wages, or pay travel expenses to facilitate the choice of a  specific representative or to allow the Complainant and representative  to confer. The Complainant and the Complainant's representative, if  employed by the Department and otherwise in a pay status, shall be on  official time, regardless of their tour of duty, when their presence is  authorized or required by the Department or the EEOC during the  investigation, informal adjustment, or hearing on the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In cases where the representation of a Complainant or the  Department would conflict with the official or collateral duties of the  representative, the EEOC or the Department may, after giving the  representative an opportunity to respond, disqualify the representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unless the Complainant states otherwise in writing, after the  Department has received written notice of the name, address and  telephone number of a representative for the Complainant, all official  correspondence shall be with the representative with copies to the  Complainant. When the Complainant designates an attorney as  representative, service of all official correspondence shall be made on  the attorney and the Complainant, but time frames for receipt of  materials shall be computed from the time of receipt by the attorney.  The Complainant must serve all official correspondence on the designated  representative of the Department and shall notify the Department of any  changes of the representative and Complainant's address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Complainant shall at all times be responsible for proceeding  with the complaint and cooperating in the entire EEO complaint process,  whether or not the Complainant has designated a representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Witnesses who are Federal employees, regardless of their tour of  duty and regardless of whether they are employed by the Department or  some other Federal agency, shall be in a   duty status when their presence is authorized or required by EEOC or  Department officials in connection with an EEO complaint.</p>
