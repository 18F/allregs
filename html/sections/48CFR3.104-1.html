For broad agency announcements  and small business innovation research programs, each proposal received  by an agency constitutes a separate procurement for purposes of 41  U.S.C. chapter 21.</p><p class="depth0">In excess of $10,000,000 means--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The value, or estimated value, at the time of award, of the  contract, including all options;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The total estimated value at the time of award of all orders  under an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, or requirements  contract;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Any multiple award schedule contract, unless the contracting  officer documents a lower estimate;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> The value of a delivery order, task order, or an order under a  Basic Ordering Agreement;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> The amount paid or to be paid in settlement of a claim; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> The estimated monetary value of negotiated overhead or other  rates when applied to the Government portion of the applicable  allocation base.</p><p class="depth0">Official means--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> An officer, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2104;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> An employee, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em>; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> A special Government employee, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202.</p><p class="depth0">Participating personally and substantially in a Federal agency  procurement means--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Active and significant involvement of an official in any of the  following activities directly related to that procurement:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Drafting, reviewing, or approving the specification or statement  of work for the procurement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Preparing or developing the solicitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Evaluating bids or proposals, or selecting a source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> Negotiating price or terms and conditions of the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(v)</em> Reviewing and approving the award of the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Participating personally means participating directly, and  includes the direct and active supervision of a subordinate's  participation in the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Participating substantially means that the official's  involvement is of significance to the matter. Substantial participation  requires more than official responsibility, knowledge, perfunctory  involvement, or involvement on an administrative or peripheral issue.  Participation may be substantial even though it is not determinative of  the outcome of a particular matter. A finding of substantiality should  be based not only on the effort devoted to a matter, but on the  importance of the effort. While a series of peripheral involvements may  be insubstantial, the single act of approving or participating in a  critical step may be substantial. However, the review of procurement  documents solely to determine compliance with regulatory,  administrative, or budgetary procedures, does not constitute substantial  participation in a procurement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Generally, an official will not be considered to have  participated personally and substantially in a procurement solely by  participating in the following activities:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Agency-level boards, panels, or other advisory committees that  review program milestones or evaluate and make recommendations regarding  alternative technologies or approaches for satisfying broad agency-level  missions or objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> The performance of general, technical, engineering, or  scientific effort having broad application not directly associated with  a particular procurement, notwithstanding that such general, technical,  engineering, or scientific effort subsequently may be incorporated into  a particular procurement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Clerical functions supporting the conduct of a particular  procurement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> For procurements to be conducted under the procedures of OMB  Circular A-76, participation in management studies, preparation of in- house cost estimates, preparation of ``most efficient organization''  analyses, and furnishing of data or technical support to be used by  others in the development of performance standards, statements of work,  or specifications.</p><p class="depth3">Source selection evaluation board means any board, team, council, or  other group that evaluates bids or proposals.
