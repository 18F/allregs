                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unless otherwise provided in this part, the fees to be charged and collected for any service performed, in accordance with this part, on a fee basis shall be based on the applicable formulas specified in this section. For each calendar year, AMS will calculate the rate for grading, certification, or inspection services, per hour per program employee using the following formulas:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Regular rate. The total AMS grading, certification, or inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Overtime rate. The total AMS grading, certification, or inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Holiday rate. The total AMS grading, certification, or inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year/historical actual costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Benefits rate. The total AMS grading, certification, or inspection program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and

holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operating rate. The total AMS grading, certification, or inspection program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allowance for bad debt rate. Total AMS grading, certification, or inspection program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most recent Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.
