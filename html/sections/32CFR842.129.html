                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart does not establish legal theories for adjudication of claims. Refer to the appropriate subpart to decide whether a claim is payable (e.g., subpart D for personnel claims; subpart K for tort claims), then use the rules in this subpart to decide the appropriate funds for payment of any approved claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims arising from property damage to or loss from vehicles or loss of personal items stored in base MWR facilities will be evaluated under the normal rules applied by the appropriate subpart of this part, and paid using the rules in those subparts. Examples include recreational vehicles stored in authorized lots and used cars parked in onbase sales lots. One exception to this rule is the exclusion of personal items stolen from onbase gym lockers (discussed below).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a NAF fee has been charged in connection with the use of the storage location, a determination must be made on the nature of the fee charged. If the fee does no more than reimburse NAF costs in administering or maintaining the storage location, subpart O of this part applies in addition to other appropriate subparts. If the fee is set to generate a profit for the NAFI involved or if it is collected in accordance with the terms of an agreement, express or implied, under which the NAFI represents that it will provide some degree of security or safeguarding of the property, the claim will be paid with NAF funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Normally, theft of items from gym lockers will be paid out of appropriated funds providing there is affirmative evidence of theft. Mysterious loss of property will not be paid and, in no case, will a claim be paid in excess of $250.</p>
