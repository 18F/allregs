If wooden troughs are used for feeding, an adequate supply of buckets or other metal containers shall be provided for the proper watering of the animals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sheep, goats, and swine. Pens for these animals shall have feed troughs not less than 8 inches wide and shall be equipped with proper receptacles for watering.
