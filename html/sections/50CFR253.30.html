                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Specific definitions. For the purposes of this section, the  following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Crab means those crab species managed under the Fishery  Management Plan for Bering Sea/Aleutian Island (BSAI) King and Tanner  Crab.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Crab FMP means the Fishery Management Plan for BSAI King and  Tanner Crab.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Crab quota share means a BSAI King and Tanner Crab permit, the  base amount of which is used as a basis for the annual calculation of a  person's Crab IFQ, also abbreviated as ``Crab QS.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Crab captains or crewmen. The Program may finance up to 80  percent of the cost of purchasing Crab QS by a citizen:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Who is or was:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A captain of a crab fishing vessel, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A crew member of a crab fishing vessel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Who has been issued the appropriate documentation of eligibility  by RAM;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whose aggregate holdings of QS will not exceed any limit on Crab  QS holdings that may be in effect in the Crab FMP implementing  regulations or applicable statutes in effect at the time of loan  closing; and will not hold either individually or collectively, based on  the initial QS pool, as published in 50 CFR part 680, Table 8; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Who, at the time of initial application, meets all other  applicable eligibility requirements to fish for crab or hold Crab QS  contained in the Crab FMP implementing regulations or applicable  statutes in effect at the time of loan closing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Refinancing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Program may refinance any existing debts  associated with Crab QS that an applicant currently holds, provided  that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Crab QS being refinanced would have been eligible for  Program financing at the time the applicant purchased it;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The applicant meets the Program's applicable lending  requirements; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The applicant would meet the requirements found in the Crab  FMP implementing regulations at the time any such refinancing loan would  close.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Program may refinance an amount up to 80 percent of Crab  QS's current market value; however, the Program will not disburse any  amount that exceeds the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued  interest (if any), of the existing Crab QS debt being refinanced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event that the current market value of Crab QS and  current principal balance do not meet the 80 percent requirement in  paragraph (c)(2) of   this section, applicants seeking refinancing may be required to provide  additional down payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Maturity. Loan maturity may not exceed 25 years, but may be  shorter depending on credit and other considerations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Repayment. Repayment schedules will be set by the loan  documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Security. Although the quota share will be the primary  collateral for a Crab QS loan, the Program may require additional  security pledges to maintain the priority of the Program's security  interest. The Program, at its option, may also require all parties with  significant ownership interests to personally guarantee loan repayment  for any applicant that is a corporation, partnership, or other entity.  Subject to the Program's credit risk determination, some projects may  require additional security, collateral, or credit enhancement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Crew member transfer eligibility certification. The Program will  accept RAM transfer eligibility certification as proof that applicants  are eligible to hold Crab QS. The application of any person determined  by RAM to be unable to receive such certification will be declined.  Applicants who fail to obtain appropriate transfer eligibility  certification within 45 working days of the date of application may lose  their processing priority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Crab Quota Share Ownership Limitation. A program obligor must  comply with all applicable maximum amounts, as may be established by  NMFS regulations, policy or North Pacific Fishery Management Council  action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Program credit standards. Crab QS loans are subject to all  Program general credit standards and requirements. Collateral, guarantee  and other requirements may be adjusted to individual credit risks.    Sec. Sec. 253.31-253.49  [Reserved]</p>
