The maximum charge will be rounded to the nearest $1000. For every company with an annual charge determined to be above the maximum charge, that company's annual charge will be set at the maximum charge, and any amount above the maximum charge will be reapportioned to the remaining companies. The reapportionment will be computed using the method outlined in paragraph (a) of this section (but excluding

any company whose annual charge is already set at the maximum amount). This procedure will be repeated until no company's annual charge exceeds the maximum charge.</p><p class="depth2">SUBCHAPTER X_PROCEDURAL RULES</p>
