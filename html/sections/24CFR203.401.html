                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Conveyed properties. Where a claim for the insurance benefits is filed in accordance with this subpart, based on the conveyance of title to the mortgaged property to the Commissioner, the amount of the insurance benefits shall be computed by adding to the original principal balance of the mortgage (as increased by the amount of open-end advances made by the mortgagee and approved by the Commissioner) which was unpaid on the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, on the date of the acquisition of the property otherwise after default, or on the date the property was acquired by the Commissioner under a direct conveyance by the mortgagor, the amount of all payments made by the mortgagee and allowances for items set forth in Sec. 203.402, less all applicable items set forth in Sec. 203.403.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Claims without conveyance of title. (1) If the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property pursuant to a bid amount equal to the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value and the mortgagee elects to retain title as provided in Sec. 203.368(g)(2), or if the mortgagee acquires title pursuant to a bid in excess of the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value (see Sec. 203.368(g)(4)), the amount of the insurance benefits shall be determined by deducting the amount bid at the sale from the original principal balance of the mortgage (as increased by the amount of open-end advances made by the mortgagee and approved by the Commissioner) which was unpaid on the date of institution of the foreclosure proceedings, and adding to the difference, if any, all applicable items set forth in Sec. 203.402 and subtracting therefrom all applicable items set forth in Sec. 203.403; provided however, that appropriate adjustment shall be made for any such items covered by proceeds of the foreclosure sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a party other than the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property pursuant to a bid at foreclosure sale not less in amount than the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, the amount of the insurance benefits shall be determined by deducting the proceeds of the foreclosure sale distributed to the mortgagee from the original principal balance of the mortgage (as increased by the amount of

open-end advances made by the mortgagee and approved by the Commissioner) which was unpaid on the date of the foreclosure proceedings, and adding to the difference, if any, all applicable items set forth in Sec. 203.402 and subtracting therefrom all applicable items set forth in Sec. 203.403; provided, however, that appropriate adjustment shall be made for any such items covered by the proceeds of the foreclosure sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property pursuant to a bid not less in amount than the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, and the mortgagor or another party redeems the property, the amount of the insurance benefits shall be determined by deducting the amount paid to redeem the property and received by the mortgagee from the original principal balance of that mortgage (as increased by the amount of open-end advances made by the mortgagee and approved by the Commissioner) which was unpaid on the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, and adding to the difference, if any, all applicable items set forth in Sec. 203.402 and subtracting therefrom all applicable items set forth in Sec. 203.403; provided however, that appropriate adjustments shall be made for any such items covered by that amount paid by the mortgagor or other party to redeem the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Pre-foreclosure Sales. Where a claim for insurance benefits is filed in accordance with this subpart, based on a pre-foreclosure sale approved by or on behalf of the Secretary (under the provisions of Sec. 203.370), the amount of insurance benefits shall be computed by adding to the original principal balance of the mortgage (as increased by the amount of open-end advances made by the mortgagee and approved by the Commissioner) which was unpaid on the date of closing of the pre-foreclosure sale, the amount of all applicable items set forth in Sec. 203.402; provided however that appropriate adjustment shall be made for any such items covered by proceeds of the pre-foreclosure sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Final Payment. (1) The mortgagee may not file for any additional payments of its mortgage insurance claim after six months from payment by the Commissioner of the final payment except for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cases where the Commissioner requests or requires a deficiency judgment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other cases where the Commissioner determines it appropriate and expressly authorizes an extension of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of this section, the term final payment shall mean, in the case of claims filed for conveyed properties, the payment under subpart B of this part which is made by the Commissioner based upon the submission by the mortgagee of all required documents and information filed pursuant to Sec. 203.365. In the case of claims filed under claims without conveyance of title, final payment shall mean the payment which is made by the Commissioner based upon submission by the mortgagee of all required documents and information filed pursuant to Secs. 203.368 and 203.401(b). In the case of claims filed pursuant to pre-foreclosure sales, final payment shall mean the payment which is made by the Commissioner based upon submission by the mortgagee of all required documents and information filed pursuant to Secs. 203.370 and 203.401(d).
