The concentration  of these solvents may be determined using EPA test method 18, material  safety data sheets, or engineering calculations. Wipe cleaning  activities, such as using a rag containing halogenated solvent or a  spray cleaner containing halogenated solvent are not covered under the  provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as noted in appendix C (General Provisions Applicability  to subpart T) of this subpart, the provisions of subpart A of this part  (General Provisions) apply to owners or operators of any solvent  cleaning machine meeting the applicability criteria of paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, each  solvent cleaning machine subject to this subpart that commenced  construction or reconstruction after November 29, 1993 shall achieve  compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except for Sec. 63.471,  immediately upon start-up or by December 2, 1994, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, each  solvent cleaning machine subject to this subpart that commenced  construction or reconstruction on or before November 29, 1993 shall  achieve compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except for  Sec. 63.471, no later than December 2, 1997.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In delegating implementation and enforcement authority to a  State under section 112(d) of the Act, the authority contained in  paragraph (f) of this section shall be retained by the Administrator and  not transferred to a State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each continuous web cleaning machine subject to this subpart  shall achieve compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except for  Sec. 63.471, no later than December 2, 1999.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If you are an owner or operator of an area source subject to  this subpart, you are exempt from the obligation to obtain a permit  under 40 CFR part 70 or 71, provided you are not required to obtain a  permit under 40 CFR 70.3(a) or 71.3(a) for a reason other than your  status as an area source under this subpart.
