                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a family unit is conveyed or a mortgage is assigned to the  Secretary, the family unit and the common areas and facilities  (including restricted common areas and facilities) designated for the  particular unit shall be undamaged by fire, flood, earthquake, tornado,  or boiler explosion, or, as to mortgages insured on or after June 8,  1977, due to failure of the mortgagee to take action as required by  Sec. 203.377. If the property has been damaged, either of the following  actions shall be taken:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The property may be repaired prior to its conveyance or prior to  the assignment of the mortgage to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With the prior approval of the Secretary, the property may be  conveyed or the mortgage assigned to the Secretary without repairing the  damage. In such instances, the Secretary shall deduct from the insurance  benefits either his estimate of the decrease in value of the family unit  or the amount of any insurance recovery received by the mortgagee,  whichever amount is the greater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the property has been damaged by fire and such property was  not covered by fire insurance at the time of the damage, the mortgagee  may convey the property or assign the mortgage to the Secretary without  deduction from the insurance benefits for any loss occasioned by such  fire if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The property shall have been covered by fire insurance at the  time the mortgage was insured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fire insurance company shall have later canceled or refused  to renew the policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The mortgagee shall have notified the Secretary within 30 days  (or within such further time as the Secretary may approve) of the  cancellation of the fire insurance or of the refusal of the insuring  company to renew the fire insurance. This notification shall have been  accompanied by a certification of the mortgagee that diligent efforts  were made, but it was unable to obtain fire insurance coverage at  reasonably competitive rates and that it will continue its efforts to  obtain adequate fire insurance coverage at competitive rates, including  coverage under the FAIR Plan. A reasonable rate is a rate not more than  25 percent in excess of the rate or the advisory rate filed or used by  the principal rating organization doing business in the state. If the  property is located in a state which has no rate or advisory rate as  provided in the preceding sentence, the mortgagee shall consult the  Director of the local HUD office as to a reasonable rate. When hazard  insurance coverage has been cancelled or renewal has been refused after  the mortgage is insured, and other hazard insurance coverage cannot be  obtained in an amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan  but insurance can be obtained in a reduced amount from a FAIR Plan or  another insurance carrier, the Commissioner will accept the reduced  coverage without reduction of mortgage insurance benefits, if the rates  do not exceed the guidelines stated herein. If coverage in any amount is  only available at rates in excess of a reasonable rate as defined  herein, the mortgagor may but shall not be required to purchase such  coverage. If coverage is purchased, the amount of any claim for  insurance benefits under this part shall be reduced by the amount of any  recovery of hazard insurance benefits by the mortgagee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The mortgagee shall not be liable for damage to the property by  waste in connection with mortgage insurance claims paid on or after July  2, 1968. However, the mortgagee shall be responsible for damage to or  destruction of security properties on which the loans are in default and  which properties are vacant or abandoned due to the mortgagee's failure  to take reasonable action to inspect, protect and preserve such  properties as required by Sec. 203.377, as to all mortgages insured on  or after January 1, 1977, but such responsibility shall not exceed the  amount of its insurance claim as to a particular property.  [41 FR 1176, Jan. 6, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 29306, June 8, 1977]</p>
