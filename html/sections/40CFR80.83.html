For purposes of subparts D and F of this part, renewable oxygenate is defined as provided in this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of oxygenate added to reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is not designated as VOC-controlled or that is not subject to the additional requirements associated with an extended non-commingling season pursuant to Sec. 80.83(i), renewable oxygenate shall be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An oxygenate that is derived from non-fossil fuel feedstocks; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An ether that is produced using an oxygenate that is derived from non-fossil fuel feedstocks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of oxygenate added to reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is designated as VOC-controlled or that is subject to the additional requirements associated with an extended non-commingling season pursuant to Sec. 80.83(i), renewable oxygenate shall be an ether that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An oxygenate other than those ethers specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be considered a renewable oxygenate if the Administrator approves a petition to that effect. The Administrator may approve such a petition if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the oxygenate does not cause volatility increases in gasoline that are non-linear in nature (i.e., a non-linear vapor pressure blending curve). The Administrator may approve a petition subject to any appropriate conditions or limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)</em> Oxygenate shall be renewable only if the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender who uses the oxygenate is able to establish in the form of documentation that the oxygenate was produced from a non-fossil fuel feedstock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Oxygenate shall be renewable only if the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender who uses the oxygenate is able to establish in the form of documentation that the oxygenate was produced from a non-fossil fuel feedstock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> Any person who produces renewable oxygenate, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or who stores, transports, transfers, or sells such renewable oxygenate, and where

such renewable oxygenate is intended to be used in the production of gasoline, shall maintain documents that state the renewable source of the oxygenate, and shall supply to any transferee of the oxygenate documents which state the oxygenate is from a renewable source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any person who produces renewable oxygenate, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or who stores, transports, transfers, or sells such renewable oxygenate, and where

such renewable oxygenate is intended to be used in the production of gasoline, shall maintain documents that state the renewable source of the oxygenate, and shall supply to any transferee of the oxygenate documents which state the oxygenate is from a renewable source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any person who imports oxygenate that is represented by the importer to be renewable oxygenate, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, shall maintain documents, obtained from the person who produced the oxygenate, that include a certification signed by the owner or chief executive officer of the company that produced the oxygenate that states:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The nature of the feedstock for the oxygenate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A description of the manner in which the oxygenate meets the renewable definition under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No person may represent any oxygenate as renewable unless the oxygenate meets the renewable definition under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For purposes of this section, an oxygenate shall be considered to be derived from non-fossil fuel feedstocks only if the oxygenate is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Derived from a source other than petroleum, coal, natural gas, or peat; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Derived from a product:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That was produced using petroleum, coal, natural gas, or peat through a substantial transformation of the fossil fuel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When the product was initially produced, it was not commonly used to generate energy (e.g. automobile tires); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The product was sold or transferred for a use other than energy generation, and was later treated as a waste product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Renewable oxygenate standard.

At 59 FR 60715, Nov. 28, 1994, this section was stayed, effective Sept. 13, 1994. At 70 FR 74571, Dec. 15, 2005, Sec. 80.83 was revised; however, the amendment could not be incorporated because the section is stayed.</p>
