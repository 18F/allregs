                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any permit issued to an accredited processor to have naval stores inspected, graded, and certified by a licensed inspector may be suspended or revoked for the failure of the processor, after official notice, to correct any condition which renders his plant unqualified for licensed inspection service, or for repeated or continued non-conformance with any other provision of the act or the provisions in this part. A permit may be suspended for similar non-conformance or failure of shorter duration or less serious nature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A permit for licensed inspection may be summarily suspended or revoked by any official authorized to issue or countersign such permits where the public health, interest, or safety so requires or for willful acts or omissions by the permittee which constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of his permit under paragraph (a) of this section. In all other cases, prior to the institution of proceedings for the suspension or revocation of a permit, such authorized official shall cause to be served upon the permittee, in person or by registered mail, a statement of the facts which appear to warrant such suspension or revocation, specifying a reasonable time, depending upon the circumstances in each case, within which the permittee may demonstrate or achieve compliance with the act and the provisions in this part. The permittee may demonstrate compliance by the presentation of evidence in writing or, in the discretion of such authorized official, at an oral hearing. If, at the end of the time allowed for the permittee to demonstrate or achieve compliance, such authorized official finds he is in compliance, his permit shall not be suspended or revoked. If such authorized official finds the permittee is not in compliance, the permit may be suspended or revoked after service upon the permittee, in person or by registered mail, of a notice that such action is under consideration for reasons specified in the statement of facts previously served upon him after reasonable opportunity is given the permittee to present further evidence in his behalf. Within 7 days after receipt of notice of the suspension or revocation of his permit, the processor by letter may appeal to the Administrator for its reinstatement, and may attach to such letter any evidence he may wish to submit.</p>
