                            <p class="depth0">Certain words and phrases found in this part are defined in this section or in the FECA. Some other words and phrases that are used only in limited situations are defined in the later subparts of the regulations in this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Benefits or Compensation in the regulations in this subchapter means

Compensation as defined by the FECA at 5 U.S.C. 8101(12), which is the money OWCP pays to or on behalf of a beneficiary from the Employees' Compensation Fund. The terms Benefits and Compensation include payments for lost wages, loss of wage-earning capacity, and permanent physical impairment. The terms Benefits and Compensation also include the money paid to beneficiaries for an employee's death, including both death benefits and any death gratuity benefit. These two terms also include any other amounts paid out of the Employees' Compensation Fund for such things as medical treatment, medical examinations conducted at the request of OWCP as part of the claims adjudication process, vocational rehabilitation services under 5 U.S.C. 8111, services of an attendant and funeral expenses under 5 U.S.C. 8134, but do not include continuation of pay as provided by 5 U.S.C. 8118.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Beneficiary means an individual who is entitled to a benefit under the FECA and this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claim means a written assertion of an individual's entitlement to benefits under the FECA, submitted in a manner authorized by this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Claimant means an individual whose claim has been filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Director means the Director of OWCP or a person designated to carry out his or her functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disability means the incapacity, because of an employment injury, to earn the wages the employee was receiving at the time of injury.

Neither lack of profits, nor the characterization of the duties as a hobby, removes an unremunerated individual's responsibility to report the estimated cost to have someone else perform his or her duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Employee means, but is not limited to, an individual who fits within one of the following listed groups:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A civil officer or employee in any branch of the Government of the United States, including an officer or employee of an instrumentality wholly owned by the United States pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8101(1)(A);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An individual rendering personal service to the United States similar to the service of a civil officer or employee of the United States, without pay or for nominal pay, when a statute authorizes the acceptance or use of the service, or authorizes payment of travel or other expenses of the individual pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8101(1)(B);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An individual, other than an independent contractor or an individual employed by an independent contractor, employed on the Menominee Indian Reservation in Wisconsin in operations conducted under a statute relating to Tribal timber and logging operations on that reservation pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8101(1)(C);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An individual appointed to a position on the office staff of a former President under section 1(b) of the Act of August 25, 1958 (72 Stat. 838) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8101(1)(E); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An individual selected and serving as a Federal petit or grand juror pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8101(1)(F).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Employer or Agency means any civil agency or instrumentality of the United States Government, or any other organization, group or institution employing an individual defined as an ``employee'' by this section. These terms also refer to officers and employees of an employer having responsibility for the supervision, direction or control of employees of that employer as an ``immediate superior,'' and to other employees designated by the employer to carry out the functions vested in the employer under the FECA and this part, including officers or employees delegated responsibility by an employer for authorizing medical treatment for injured employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Entitlement means entitlement to benefits as determined by OWCP under the FECA and the procedures described in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> FECA means the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, as amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Hospital services means services and supplies provided by hospitals within the scope of their practice as defined by State law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Impairment means any anatomic or functional abnormality or loss.

This term also means an inability to work that takes place when a light-duty assignment made specifically to accommodate an employee's physical limitations due to his or her work-related injury or illness is withdrawn or when the physical requirements of such an assignment are altered so that they exceed his or her established physical limitations. A recurrence of disability does not apply when a light-duty assignment is withdrawn for reasons of misconduct, non-performance of job duties or other downsizing or where a loss of wage-earning capacity determination as provided by 5 U.S.C. 8115 is in place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(y)</em> Recurrence of medical condition means a documented need for further medical treatment after release from treatment for the accepted condition or injury when there is no accompanying work stoppage. Continuous treatment for the original condition or injury is not considered a ``need for further medical treatment after release from treatment,'' nor is an examination without treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(z)</em> Representative means an individual or law firm properly authorized by a claimant in writing to act for the claimant in connection with a claim or proceeding under the FECA or this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(aa)</em> Student means an individual defined at 5 U.S.C. 8101(17).
