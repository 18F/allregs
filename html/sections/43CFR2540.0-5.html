A claim of class 1 is  one which has been held in good faith and in peaceful adverse possession  by a claimant, his ancestors or grantors, under claim or color of title  for more than 20 years, on which valuable improvements have been placed,  or on which some part of   the land has been reduced to cultivation. A claim of class 2 is one  which has been held in good faith and in peaceful, adverse possession by  a claimant, his ancestors or grantors, under claim or color of title for  the period commencing not later than January 1, 1901, to the date of  application, during which time they have paid taxes levied on the land  by State and local governmental units. A claim is not held in good faith  where held with knowledge that the land is owned by the United States. A  claim is not held in peaceful, adverse possession where it was initiated  while the land was withdrawn or reserved for Federal purposes.
