                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Smallpox vaccine recipients and vaccinia contacts may receive payments or reimbursements for medical services and items that the Secretary determines to be reasonable and necessary to diagnose or treat a covered injury or a health complication of a covered injury (i.e., sequela). The Secretary may pay for such medical services and items in an effort to cure, counteract, or minimize the effects of any covered injury, or any health complication of a covered injury, or to give relief, reduce the degree or the period of disability, or aid in lessening the amount of monthly benefits to a requester (e.g., a surgical procedure that lessens the amount of time and expense for the treatment of a covered injury). The Secretary may make such payments or reimbursements if the medical services and items have already

been provided or if they are likely to be provided in the future. In making determinations about which medical services and items are reasonable and necessary, the Secretary may consider whether those medical services and items were prescribed or recommended by a health care practitioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To receive medical benefits for the health complications of a covered injury, a requester must demonstrate that the complications are the direct result of the covered injury. Examples of health complications include, but are not limited to, complications of a covered injury that occur as part of the natural course of the underlying disease, an adverse reaction to a prescribed medication or diagnostic test used in connection with a covered injury, or a complication of a surgical procedure used to treat a covered injury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The calculation of medical benefits available under this Program is described in Sec.  102.80. Although there are no caps on medical benefits available under this Program, the Secretary may limit payments to the amount he deems reasonable for those services and items he considers reasonable and necessary. All payment or reimbursement for medical services and items is secondary to any obligation of any third-party payor to pay for or provide such services or items to the requester. As provided in Sec.  102.84, the Secretary retains the right to recover medical benefits paid to requesters by third-party payors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Secretary may make payments or reimbursements of medical benefits to the estate of a deceased smallpox vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact as long as such benefits were accrued during the deceased person's lifetime as the result of a covered injury or its health complications and were not paid during the deceased person's lifetime.</p>
