The last day of the base period may not be more than 4 months prior to the filing date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The adjustment period is a period of up to 9 months immediately following the base period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The test period may not extend more than 9 months beyond the filing date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The rate factors (volumes, costs, and billing determinants) established during the base period may be adjusted for changes in revenues and costs which are known and measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of the filing and which will become effective within the adjustment period.

Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, adjustments to base period experience, or to estimates where 12 months' experience is not available, may include any amounts for facilities that require a certificate of public convenience and necessity, where a certificate has not been issued by the filing date but is expected to be issued before the end of the test period.
