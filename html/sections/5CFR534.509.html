                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An SL or ST employee whose rate of basic pay is higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule may not suffer a reduction in pay as a result of transfer to an SL or ST position in another agency where the maximum rate of basic pay for the applicable SL or ST rate range is equal to the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An SL or ST employee whose rate of basic pay is higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule may not suffer a reduction in pay because his or her agency's applicable performance appraisal system certification expires or is suspended under Sec. 430.405(h) of this chapter. See Sec. 530.203(g) and (h) of this chapter for treatment of the aggregate pay limit when certification status changes during the calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An agency may continue an SL or ST employee's rate of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule upon that employee's movement within the agency to an SL or ST position that is not under a certified performance appraisal system. Pay may be reduced upon the movement only as provided in Sec. 534.508.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If an agency grants a temporary pay increase under conditions described in Sec. 534.508(d) to an SL or ST employee subject to a certified performance appraisal system who, prior

to the temporary pay increase, has a rate of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule, the agency may return the employee to an SL or ST position that is not subject to a certified performance appraisal system when the temporary assignment ends and set the SL or ST employee's rate of basic pay at the rate in effect immediately before the temporary pay increase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When a rate of basic pay that is higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule is preserved under a provision of this section, the SL or ST employee will continue to receive his or her current rate of basic pay and is not eligible for a pay increase until he or she is assigned to an SL or ST position covered by a certified performance appraisal system or his or her rate of basic pay is less than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An agency that is otherwise subject to the limitation in Sec. 534.504(a)(2)(i) with respect to an SL or ST position occupied by an SL or ST employee whose rate of basic pay is authorized to be preserved under paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section may set that employee's rate of basic pay above EX-III only at the level required to preserve the applicable rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Preservation of a rate of basic pay under this section does not preclude a subsequent reduction in pay as provided in Sec. 534.508.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The provisions of this section do not apply upon the appointment of a senior professional employee to a position in the Senior Executive Service or upon the appointment of a member of the Senior Executive Service to a senior professional position.</p>
