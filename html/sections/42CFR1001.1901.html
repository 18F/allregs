This section  applies regardless of whether an individual or entity has obtained a  program provider number or equivalent, either as an individual or as a  member of a group, prior to being reinstated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An excluded individual or entity may not take assignment of an  enrollee's claim on or after the effective date of exclusion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of the Act and other provisions. In addition, submitting  claims, or causing claims to be submitted or payments to be made for  items or services furnished, ordered or prescribed, including  administrative and management services or salary, may serve as the basis  for denying reinstatement to the programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an  enrollee of Part B of Medicare submits an otherwise payable claim for  items or services furnished by an excluded individual or entity, or  under the medical direction or on the prescription of an excluded  physician or other authorized individual after the effective date of  exclusion, CMS will pay the first claim submitted by the enrollee and  immediately notify the enrollee of the exclusion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS will not pay an enrollee for items or services furnished by  an excluded individual or entity, or under the medical direction or on  the prescription of an excluded physician or other authorized individual  more than 15 days after the date on the notice to the enrollee, or after  the effective date of the exclusion, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless the Secretary determines that the health and safety of  beneficiaries receiving services under Medicare, Medicaid or any of the  other Federal health care programs warrants the exclusion taking effect  earlier, payment may be made under such program for up to 30 days after  the effective date of the exclusion for--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inpatient institutional services furnished to an individual who  was admitted to an excluded institution before the date of the  exclusion,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Home health services and hospice care furnished to an  individual under a plan of care established before the effective date of  the exclusion, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any health care items that are ordered by a practitioner,  provider or supplier from an excluded manufacturer before the effective  date of the exclusion and delivered within 30 days of the effective date  of such exclusion. (For the period October 2, 1998, to October 4, 1999,  payment may be made under Medicare or a State health care program for up  to 60 days after the effective date of the exclusion for any health care  items that are ordered by a practitioner, provider or supplier from an  excluded manufacturer before the effective date of such exclusion and  delivered within 60 days of the effect of the exclusion.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> CMS will not pay any claims submitted by, or for items or  services ordered or prescribed by, an excluded provider for dates of  service 15 days or more after the notice of the provider's exclusion was  mailed to the supplier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, payment  may be made under Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care  programs for certain emergency items or services furnished by an  excluded individual or entity, or at the medical direction or on the  prescription of an excluded physician or other authorized individual  during the period of exclusion. To be payable, a claim for such  emergency items or services must be accompanied by a sworn statement of  the person furnishing the items or services specifying the nature of the  emergency and why the items or services could not have been furnished by  an individual or entity eligible to furnish or order such items or  services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, no claim  for emergency items or services will be payable if such items or  services were provided by an excluded individual who, through an  employment, contractual or any other arrangement, routinely provides  emergency health care items or services.
