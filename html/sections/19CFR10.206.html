Any cost or value of materials or direct costs of processing operations attributable to the Virgin Islands or any CBI beneficiary country must be included in the article prior to its final exportation to the United States from a beneficiary country as defined in Sec. 10.202(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Materials produced in the United States.

For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii), no material shall be considered to be substantially transformed into a new or different article of commerce by virtue of having merely undergone simple (as opposed to complex or meaningful) combining or packaging operations, or mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article. The examples set forth in Sec. 10.196(a) of this part, and the principles and examples set forth in Sec. 10.195(a)(2) of this part, shall apply for purposes of the corresponding context under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Questionable origin.
