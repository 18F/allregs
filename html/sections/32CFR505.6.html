The standard for amendment is that the records are inaccurate as a matter of fact rather than judgment, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete. The burden of proof is on the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The system manager or custodian must review Privacy Act records for accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Amendment procedures are not intended to permit individuals to challenge events in records that have actually occurred. Amendment procedures only allow individuals to amend those items that are factually inaccurate and not matters of official judgment (e.g., performance ratings, promotion potential, and job performance appraisals). In addition, an individual is not permitted to amend records for events that have been the subject of judicial or quasi-judicial actions/proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Proper amendment requests.

Requests to amend these reports will be considered under AR 195-2. Actions taken by the Commander of U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command will constitute final action on behalf of the Secretary of the Army under that regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Records placed in the National Archives are exempt from the Privacy Act provision allowing individuals to request amendment of records. Most provisions of the Privacy Act apply only to those systems of records that are under the legal control of the originating agency; for example, an agency's current operating files or records stored at a Federal Records Center.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Inspector General investigative files and action request/complaint files (records in system notice A0021-1 SAIG, Inspector General Records) have been exempted from the amendment provisions of the Privacy Act. Requests to amend these reports will be considered under AR 20-1 by the Inspector General. Action by the Inspector General will constitute final action on behalf of the Secretary of the Army under that regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Other records that are exempt from the amendment provisions of the Privacy Act are listed in the applicable PA system of records notices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amendment procedures. (1) Requests to amend records should be addressed to the custodian or system manager of the records. The request must reasonably describe the records to be amended and the changes sought

(e.g., deletion, addition, or amendment). The burden of proof is on the requester. The system manager or records custodian will provide the individual with a written acknowledgment of the request within 10 working days and will make a final response within 30 working days of the date the request was received. The acknowledgment must clearly identify the request and inform the individual that final action will be forthcoming within 30 working days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests to amend records should be addressed to the custodian or system manager of the records.
