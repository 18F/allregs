yield to the U.S.-flag vessels freight revenue per long ton at least equal to the freight revenue per long ton afforded the foreign-flag vessels participating in the same grant, loan, or purchase transaction. A copy of the regulations or staff instructions prescribed by each department or agency shall be furnished to the Secretary, Maritime Administration, no later than June 30, 1971, for approval.
