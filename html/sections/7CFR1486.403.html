                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A Recipient may seek reimbursement for an expenditure if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The expenditure is reasonable and is specified in the project budget in furtherance of an approved activity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Recipient has not been or will not be reimbursed for such expenditure by any other source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subject to paragraph (a) of this section, CCC will reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Salaries and benefits of the Recipient's existing personnel or any other participating entity that are assigned to EMP-funded projects; however, reimbursement is limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The actual daily rate paid by the Recipient for the employee's salary or the daily rate of a General Schedule U.S. Government employee, GS-15/Step 10 in effect during the calendar year in which the project or activity is approved for funding, whichever is less;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The actual assigned time of the employee to the project; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Benefits at a maximum rate of 30 percent of the existing salary of the employee, prorated to the time assigned to the project. In addition, reimbursement for an employee's time spent on an EMP-funded project must be in lieu of compensation from the Recipient or any other participating entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consulting fees for professional services; however, reimbursement for consulting fees is limited to the daily rate of a General Schedule U.S. Government employee, GS-15/Step 10 in effect during the calendar year in which the project or activity is approved for funding. Reimbursement is authorized only for actual days worked and is not authorized for travel and rest days. Benefits are not reimbursable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> STRE, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and refreshments when part of an approved overseas trade activity; miscellaneous courtesies such as checkroom fees, taxi fares, and tips; and representation expenses such as the costs of social events or receptions that are primarily attended by foreign officials, and which are held at foreign venues. Such expenses must conform to the American Embassy representational funding guidelines as the standard for judging the appropriateness of STRE event costs. STRE incurred in the United States is not authorized for reimbursement, but may be counted as a cost-share contribution to the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Travel expenses, subject to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Air travel, limited to the full-fare economy class rate and must comply with the Fly America Act, 49 U.S.C. App. 1517. The CCC will not reimburse any portion of air travel in excess of the full fare economy rate or when the participant fails to notify the Counselor/Attache in the destination country in advance of the travel unless the Deputy Administrator determines it was impractical to provide such notification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Per diem, limited to the allowable rate for each domestic or foreign locale (41 CFR Chapter 301). Expenses in excess of the authorized per diem rates may be allowed in special or unusual circumstances (41 CFR Chapter 301, subpart D), and must be approved in advance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All other expenses while in travel status must conform to U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR Chapters 301 and 304).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Direct administrative costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Indirect costs not identified as direct costs but which are necessary to the implementation of a project. Indirect costs must be specified to be eligible for reimbursement. Indirect costs incurred by private entities (other than those identified below) may be reimbursed up to a maximum of 10 percent of the EMP funded portion of the project budget, excluding indirect costs. Market development cooperators, state regional trade groups, for-

profit entities, and government Recipients (excluding FAS) may not be reimbursed for indirect costs. Indirect costs are not reimbursable for any project funded under the Technical Issues Resolution Fund or the Quick Response Marketing Fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Rental costs for equipment necessary to carry out approved projects. Equipment rentals must be returned by the Recipient to the supplier in accordance with the lease agreements, but in no case later than 90 calendar days from the completion date of the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Procuring samples of specific commodities or agricultural products, which are appropriate and necessary to the success of a technical assistance activity.</p>
