                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each imperfection or damage that impairs the serviceability of a length of steel pipe must be repaired or removed. If a repair is made by grinding, the remaining wall thickness must at least be equal to either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The minimum thickness required by the tolerances in the specification to which the pipe was manufactured; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nominal wall thickness required for the design pressure of the pipeline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each of the following dents must be removed from steel pipe to be operated at a pressure that produces a hoop stress of 20 percent, or more, of SMYS, unless the dent is repaired by a method that reliable engineering tests and analyses show can permanently restore the serviceability of the pipe:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A dent that contains a stress concentrator such as a scratch, gouge, groove, or arc burn.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A dent that affects the longitudinal weld or a circumferential weld.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In pipe to be operated at a pressure that produces a hoop stress of 40 percent or more of SMYS, a dent that has a depth of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> More than \1/4\ inch (6.4 millimeters) in pipe 12\3/4\ inches (324 millimeters) or less in outer diameter; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> More than 2 percent of the nominal pipe diameter in pipe over 12\3/4\ inches (324 millimeters) in outer diameter.
For the purpose of this section a ``dent'' is a depression that produces a gross disturbance in the curvature of the pipe wall without reducing the pipe-wall thickness. The depth of a dent is measured as the gap between the lowest point of the dent and a prolongation of the original contour of the pipe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each arc burn on steel pipe to be operated at a pressure that produces a hoop stress of 40 percent, or more, of SMYS must be repaired or removed. If a repair is made by grinding, the arc burn must be completely removed and the remaining wall thickness must be at least equal to either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The minimum wall thickness required by the tolerances in the specification to which the pipe was manufactured; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nominal wall thickness required for the design pressure of the pipeline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A gouge, groove, arc burn, or dent may not be repaired by insert patching or by pounding out.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each gouge, groove, arc burn, or dent that is removed from a length of pipe must be removed by cutting out the damaged portion as a cylinder.
