(1) Applications to export and reexport items identified in ECCNs on the CCL as MT Column No. 1 in the Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section will be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport would make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles. Applications for exports and reexports of such items contained in Category 7A or described by ECCN 9A101 on the CCL will be considered more favorably if such exports or reexports are determined to be destined to a manned aircraft, satellite, land vehicle, or marine vessel, in quantities appropriate for replacement parts for such applications. When an export or reexport is deemed to make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles, the license will be denied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications to export and reexport items identified in ECCNs on the CCL as MT Column No. 1 in the Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section will be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport would make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles.
