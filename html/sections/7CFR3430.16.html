In addition to program-specific  eligibility requirements, awards will be made only to responsible  applicants. Specific management information relating to an applicant  shall be submitted on a one-time basis, with updates on an as-needed  basis, as part of the responsibility determination prior to an award  being made under a specific NIFA program, if such information has not  been provided previously under this or another NIFA program. NIFA will  provide copies of forms recommended for use in fulfilling these  requirements as part of the pre-award process. Although an applicant may  be eligible based on its status as one of these entities, there are  factors that may exclude   an applicant from receiving Federal financial and nonfinancial  assistance and benefits under a NIFA program (e.g., debarment or  suspension of an individual involved or a determination that an  applicant is not responsible based on submitted organizational  management information).</p>
