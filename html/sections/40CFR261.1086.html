The cover may be a separate cover installed on the container  (e.g., a lid on a drum or a suitably secured tarp on a roll-off box) or  may be an integral part of the container structural design (e.g., a  ``portable tank'' or bulk cargo container equipped with a screw-type  cap).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An open-top container in which an organic-vapor suppressing  barrier is placed on or over the hazardous secondary material in the  container such that no hazardous secondary material is exposed to the  atmosphere. One example of such a barrier is application of a suitable  organic-vapor suppressing foam.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A container used to meet the requirements of paragraph  (c)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section shall be equipped with covers and  closure devices, as applicable to the container, that are composed of  suitable materials to minimize exposure of the hazardous secondary  material to the atmosphere and to maintain the equipment integrity, for  as long as the container is in service. Factors to be considered in  selecting the materials of construction and designing the cover and  closure devices shall include: Organic vapor permeability; the effects  of contact with the hazardous secondary material or its vapor managed in  the container; the effects of outdoor exposure of the closure device or  cover material to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating  practices for which the container is intended to be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whenever a hazardous secondary material is in a container using  Container Level 1 controls, the remanufacturer or other person that  stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall install all  covers and closure devices for the container, as applicable to the  container, and secure and maintain each closure device in the closed  position except as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose  of adding hazardous secondary material or other material to the  container as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the case when the container is filled to the intended final  level in one continuous operation, the remanufacturer or other person  that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall promptly  secure the closure devices in the closed position and install the  covers, as applicable to the container, upon conclusion of the filling  operation.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material  intermittently are added to the container over   a period of time, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or  treats the hazardous secondary material shall promptly secure the  closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as applicable  to the container, upon either the container being filled to the intended  final level; the completion of a batch loading after which no additional  material will be added to the container within 15 minutes; the person  performing the loading operation leaving the immediate vicinity of the  container; or the shutdown of the process generating the hazardous  secondary material being added to the container, whichever condition  occurs first.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose  of removing hazardous secondary material from the container as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section, an  empty hazardous secondary material container may be open to the  atmosphere at any time (i.e., covers and closure devices on such a  container are not required to be secured in the closed position).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material are  removed from the container, but the container is not an empty hazardous  secondary material container, the remanufacturer or other person that  stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall promptly secure  the closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as  applicable to the container, upon the completion of a batch removal  after which no additional material will be removed from the container  within 15 minutes or the person performing the unloading operation  leaves the immediate vicinity of the container, whichever condition  occurs first.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed when access  inside the container is needed to perform routine activities other than  transfer of hazardous secondary material. Examples of such activities  include those times when a worker needs to open a port to measure the  depth of or sample the material in the container, or when a worker needs  to open a manhole hatch to access equipment inside the container.

The settings at which the device opens shall be  established such that the device remains in the closed position whenever  the internal pressure of the container is within the internal pressure  operating range determined by the remanufacturer or other persons that  stores or treats the hazardous secondary material based on container  manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection  and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other  requirements for the safe handling of flammable, ignitable, explosive,  reactive, or hazardous materials. Examples of normal operating  conditions that may require these devices to open are during those times  when the internal pressure of the container exceeds the internal  pressure operating range for the container as a result of loading  operations or diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Opening of a safety device, as defined in 40 CFR 261.1081, is  allowed at any time conditions require doing so to avoid an unsafe  condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the  hazardous secondary material using containers with Container Level 1  controls shall inspect the containers and their covers and closure  devices as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case when a hazardous secondary material already is in  the container at the time the remanufacturer or other person that stores  or treats the hazardous secondary material first accepts possession of  the container at the facility and the container is not   emptied within 24 hours after the container is accepted at the facility  (i.e., is not an empty hazardous secondary material container) the  remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous  secondary material shall visually inspect the container and its cover  and closure devices to check for visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other  open spaces into the interior of the container when the cover and  closure devices are secured in the closed position.

If a defect is detected, the  remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous  secondary material shall repair the defect in accordance with the  requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When a defect is detected for the container, cover, or closure  devices, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the  hazardous secondary material shall make first efforts at repair of the  defect no later than 24 hours after detection and repair shall be  completed as soon as possible but no later than 5 calendar days after  detection.
