The Rural Business-Cooperative Service or successor for the programs it administers.</p><p class="depth0">Agricultural commodity. An unprocessed product of farms, ranches, nurseries, and forests and natural and man-made bodies of water, that the independent producer has cultivated, raised, or harvested with legal access rights. Agricultural commodities include plant and animal products and their by-products, such as crops, forestry products, hydroponics, nursery stock, aquaculture, meat, on-farm generated manure, and fish and seafood products. Agricultural commodities do not include horses or other animals raised or sold as pets, such as cats, dogs, and ferrets.</p><p class="depth0">Agricultural food product. Agricultural food products can be a raw, cooked, or processed edible substance, beverage, or ingredient intended for human consumption. These products cannot be animal feed, live animals, non-harvested plants, fiber, medicinal products, cosmetics, tobacco products, or narcotics.</p><p class="depth0">Agricultural producer. An individual or entity directly engaged in the production of an agricultural commodity, or that has the legal right to harvest an agricultural commodity, that is the subject of the value-added project. Agricultural producers may ``directly engage'' either through substantially participating in the labor, management, and field operations themselves or by maintaining ownership and financial control of the agricultural operation.</p><p class="depth0">Agricultural producer group. A membership organization that represents independent producers and whose mission includes working on behalf of independent producers and the majority of whose membership and board of directors is comprised of independent producers. The independent producers, on whose behalf the value-added work will be done, must be confirmed as eligible and identified by name or class.</p><p class="depth0">Applicant. The legal entity submitting an application to participate in the competition for program funding. The applicant must be legally structured to meet one of the four eligible applicant types: Independent Producer, Agricultural Producer Group, Farmer or Rancher Cooperative, or Majority-Controlled Producer Based Business.</p><p class="depth0">Beginning farmer or rancher. This term has the meaning given it in section 343(a) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1991(a)) and is an entity in which none of the individual owners have operated a farm or a ranch for more than 10 years. For the purposes of this subpart, a beginning farmer or rancher must be an Independent Producer that, at the time of application submission, currently owns and produces more than 50 percent of the agricultural commodity to which value will be added and has an applicant ownership or membership of 51 percent or more beginning farmers or ranchers.

It may also contain background information about the organization or team attempting to reach those goals.</p><p class="depth0">Change in physical state. An irreversible processing activity that alters the raw agricultural commodity into a marketable value-added product. This processing activity must be something other than a post-harvest process that primarily acts to preserve the commodity for later sale.

Examples of ineligible products include, but are not limited to, pressure-ripened produce, raw bottled milk, container grown trees, plugs, and cut flowers.</p><p class="depth0">Conflict of interest. A situation in which a person or entity has competing personal, professional, or financial interests that make it difficult for the person or business to act impartially. Regarding use of both grant and matching funds, Federal procurement standards prohibit transactions that involve a real or apparent conflict of interest for owners, employees, officers, agents, or their immediate family members having a financial or other interest in the outcome of the project; or that restrict open and free competition for unrestrained trade. Specifically, grant and matching funds may not be used to support costs for services or goods going to, or coming from, a person or entity with a real or apparent conflict of interest, including, but

not limited to, owner(s) and their immediate family members. See Sec. 4284.923(a) and (b) for limited exceptions to this definition and practice for VAPG.</p><p class="depth0">Departmental regulations.

Independent producers must maintain ownership of the agricultural commodity or product from its raw state through the production and marketing of the value-added product. Producers who produce the agricultural commodity under contract for another entity, but do not own the agricultural commodity or value-added product produced are not considered independent producers. Entities that contract out the production of an agricultural commodity are not considered independent producers. Independent producer entities must confirm their owner members as eligible and must identify them by name or class.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A steering committee comprised of specifically identified agricultural producers in the process of organizing one of the four program eligible entity types that will operate a value-added venture and will supply the majority of the agricultural commodity for the value-added project during the grant period. Such entity must be legally authorized before the grant agreement will be approved by the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> A harvester of an agricultural commodity that can document their legal right to access and harvest the

A cost-sharing contribution to the project via confirmed cash or funding commitments from eligible sources without a real or apparent conflict of interest, that are used for eligible project purposes during the grant funding period. Matching funds must be at least equal to the grant amount, and combined grant and matching funds must equal 100 percent of the total project costs. All matching funds must be verified by authentic documentation from the source as part of the application. Matching funds must be provided in the form of confirmed applicant cash, loan, or line of credit, or provided in the form of a confirmed applicant or family member in-kind contribution that meets the requirements and limitations in Sec. 4284.923(a) and (b); or confirmed third-party cash or eligible third-party in-kind contribution; or confirmed non-federal grant sources (unless otherwise provided by law).

Local and regional supply networks that link independent producers with businesses and cooperatives that market value-added agricultural products in a manner that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Targets and strengthens the profitability and competitiveness of small and medium-sized farms and ranches that are structured as a family farm; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Obtains agreement from an eligible agricultural producer group, farmer or rancher cooperative, or majority-controlled producer-based business venture that is engaged in the value chain on a marketing strategy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> For mid-tier value chain projects, the Agency recognizes that, in a supply chain network, a variety of raw agricultural commodity and value-added product ownership and transfer arrangements may be necessary. Consequently, applicant ownership of the raw agricultural commodity and value-added product from raw through value-added is not necessarily required, as long as the mid-tier value chain proposal can demonstrate an increase in customer base and an increase in revenue returns to the applicant producers supplying the majority of the raw agricultural commodity for the project.</p><p class="depth0">Planning grant. A grant to facilitate the development of a defined program of economic planning activities to determine the viability of a potential value-added venture, and specifically for the purpose of paying for a qualified consultant to conduct and develop a feasibility study, business plan, and/or marketing plan associated with the
