                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any individual may submit a recommendation to suspend a  contractor to the DSPE. The recommendation to suspend must be supported  with evidence of a cause for suspension listed in FAR 9.407-2. When the  DSPE receives a recommendation for suspension, he or she will refer the  matter to the D&S; Committee. If the reporting individual is a VA  employee and the recommendation to suspend is based on possible criminal  or fraudulent activities, the VA employee must report the circumstances  to the VA Office of Inspector General before making a recommendation to  the DSPE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the D&S; Committee finds evidence of a cause for suspension,  as listed in FAR 9.407-2, with or without a recommendation, it will  conduct a fact-finding and present facts and recommendations to the  suspending official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> for the signature of the suspending official. The signed  notice of suspension will be sent to the last known address of the  contractor, the contractor's counsel, or agent for service of process,  by certified mail, return receipt requested. In the case of a business,  the D&S; Committee may send the notice of suspension to any partner,  principal, officer, director, owner or co-owner, or joint venture. The  D&S; Committee concurrently must post notice of suspension to the General  Services Administration Excluded Parties List System pending completion  of investigation and any ensuing legal proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If VA receives a reply from the contractor within 45 calendar  days of sending the notice of suspension, the D&S; Committee must  consider the information in the reply before the Committee makes further  recommendations to the suspending official. The D&S; Committee, upon the  request of a suspended contractor, must, as soon as practicable, allow  the contractor an opportunity to appear before the D&S; Committee to  present information or argument in person or through a representative.  The contractor may supplement the oral presentation with written  information and argument. The proceeding will be conducted in an  informal manner and without requirement for a transcript. The D&S;  Committee shall prepare a report of the proceeding for the suspending  official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In actions not based on an indictment, if the D&S; Committee  finds that the contractor's submission in opposition to the suspension  raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, the D&S;  Committee shall submit to the suspending official the information  establishing the dispute of material facts. However, the D&S; Committee  must first coordinate any further proceeding regarding the facts in  dispute with the Department of Justice or with a State prosecuting  authority in a case involving a State jurisdiction. VA will take no  further action to determine disputed material facts pursuant to this  section or 809.470 if the Department of Justice or a State prosecuting  authority advises VA that additional proceedings to make such a  determination would prejudice Federal or State legal proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the suspending official agrees that there is a genuine  dispute of material facts, the suspending official shall refer the  dispute to the designee for resolution pursuant to 809.470.</p>
