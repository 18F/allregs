For  Interstate funds to be used for such eligible projects the Federal-aid  Interstate system must be the system which substantially benefits. The  benefiting system is that system which would have otherwise carried the  high occupancy vehicle or rail passengers to their destination.  Interstate construction funds may be used only where the parking  facility was approved in the 1981 Interstate Cost Estimate and is  constructed in conjunction with a high occupancy vehicle lane approved  in the 1981 Interstate Cost Estimate.</p>
