                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At the time the proof of posting is filed the claimant must file  in duplicate an application for patent showing that he has the  possessory right to the claim, in virtue of a compliance by himself (and  by his grantors, if he claims by purchase) with the mining rules,  regulations, and customs of the mining district or State in which the  claim lies, and with the mining laws of Congress, such statement to  narrate briefly, but as clearly as possible, the facts constituting such  compliance, the origin of his possession, and the basis of his claim to  a patent. The application should contain a full description of the kind  and character of the vein or lode and should state whether ore has been  extracted therefrom; and if so, in what amount and of what value. It  should also show the precise place within the limits of each of the  locations embraced in the application where the vein or lode has been  exposed or discovered and the width thereof. The showing in these  regards should contain sufficient data to enable representatives of the  Government to confirm the same by examination in the field and also  enable the Bureau of Land Management to determine whether a valuable  deposit of mineral actually exists within the limits of each of the  locations embraced in the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Every application for patent, based on a mining claim located  after August 1, 1946, shall state whether the claimant has or has not  had any direct or indirect part in the development of the atomic bomb  project. The application must set forth in detail the exact nature of  the claimant's participation in the project, and must also state whether  as a result of such participation he acquired any confidential, official  information as to the existence of deposits of uranium, thorium, or  other fissionable source materials in the lands covered by his  application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In applying for patent to a mining claim embracing land lying  partly within one proper office and partly within another, a full set of  papers must be filed in each office, except that one abstract of title  and one proof of patent expenditures will be sufficient. Only one  newspaper publication and one posting on the claim will be required, but  proof thereof must be filed in both offices, the statements as to  posting plat and notice on the claim to be signed within the respective  land districts, as well, also, as all of the other statements required  in mineral patent proceedings, except such as, under the law, may be  signed outside of the land district wherein the land applied for is  situated. Publication, payment of fees, and the purchase price of the  land will be further governed by the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1823.4(a)  and 1861.2 of this chapter.</p>
