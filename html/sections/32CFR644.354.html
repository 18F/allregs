                            <p class="depth0">As an exception to its general policy, GSA has agreed with the  Department of Defense to accept reports of excess on some facilities  with instructions on their disposal, specifically:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Defense Industrial Reserve (DIR). The Defense Industrial Reserve  Act 50 U.S.C. 451 et seq., authorizes the Secretary of Defense to  determine which excess industrial properties should become a part of DIR  and to formulate a national security clause or recapture provisions to  preserve the production capacity of the plants for use in the event of a  national emergency. Excess DIR plants are reported to GSA for disposal  subject to the national security clause or the recapture provisions.  (See FPMR Subsection 101-47.306-2 for procedures where GSA is unable to  dispose   of the property because of the restrictions imposed by the national  security clause or recapture provisions.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reserving property for civil defense purposes. GSA has agreed to  accept reports of excess of missile sites and other facilities having  similar protective features, with restrictions on their disposal. DEs  will be notified when DOD advises that a specified local government unit  is interested in acquiring such property. Reports of excess will specify  the local government unit interested. Disposal of the property will be  limited to conveyance to the local government unit, with conditions  restricting its use to civil defense purposes for a period of 20 years,  with reverter to the United States for breach of condition. In  appropriate cases, GSA will enter into a temporary lease arrangement if  necessary to afford a local government unit an opportunity to obtain the  necessary funds for purchase. This procedure is limited to cases where  DOD has determined and advised there is a civil defense need. Disposal  action will not be delayed pending receipt of such advise.</p>
