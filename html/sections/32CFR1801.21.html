                                Sec. 1801.21  Processing requests for access to or amendment of records.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Requests meeting the requirements of Sec. 1801.11 through Sec. 1801.13 shall be processed under both the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the applicable regulations, unless the requester demands otherwise in writing. Such requests will be processed under both Acts regardless of whether the requester cites one Act in the request, both, or neither. This action is taken in order to ensure the maximum possible disclosure to the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Receipt, recording and tasking. Upon receipt of a request meeting the requirements of Secs. 1801.11 through 1801.13, NACIC shall within ten (10) days record each request, acknowledge receipt to the requester, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to the office(s) reasonably believed to hold responsive records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of certain exemptions. In processing a request, NACIC shall decline to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of any responsive records whenever the fact of their existence or nonexistence is itself classified under Executive Order 12958 and that confirmation of the existence of a record may jeopardize intelligence sources and methods protected pursuant to section 103(c)(6) of the National Security Act of 1947. In such circumstances, NACIC, in the form of a final written response, shall so inform the requester and advise of his or her right to an administrative appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time for response. Although the Privacy Act does not mandate a time for response, our joint treatment of requests under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA means that the NACIC should provide a response within the FOIA statutory guideline of ten (10) days on initial requests and twenty (20) days on administrative appeals. However, the volume of requests may require that NACIC seek additional time from a requester pursuant to Sec. 1801.33. In such event, NACIC will inform the requester in writing and further advise of his or

her right to file an administrative appeal.</p>
