                            <p class="depth0">In any case in which Sec. Sec. 36.4390 through 36.4393 are applicable, as set forth in Sec. 36.4391, no action will be taken by the Department of Veterans Affairs on any request for appraisal relating to proposed construction, site approval of land to be improved by a builder, sponsor or developer for the construction of housing thereon, or for a direct loan fund reservation commitment unless the builder, sponsor or developer has furnished the Department of Veterans Affairs a signed certification in form as follows:</p><p class="depth0">To induce the Department of Veterans Affairs to act on any request submitted by or on behalf of the undersigned for site approval of land to be improved for the construction of housing thereon to be financed with loans guaranteed, insured or made by the Department of Veterans Affairs, or for establishment by the Department of Veterans Affairs of reasonable value relating to proposed construction or for direct loan fund reservation commitments, the undersigned hereby agrees that it will incorporate or cause to be incorporated into any contract for construction work or modification thereof, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Secretary of Labor relating to the land or housing included in its request to the Department of Veterans Affairs the following equal opportunity clause:</p><p class="depth0">During the performance of this contract the contractor agrees as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to the following: Employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The contractor will, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor, state that all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex or national origin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The contractor will send to each labor union or representative of workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice to be provided advising the said labor union or workers' representative of the contractor's commitments under section 202 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> The contractor will comply with all provisions of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and of the rules, regulations and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> The contractor will furnish all information and reports required by Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and by the rules, regulations and orders of the Secretary of Labor, or pursuant thereto, and will permit access to his books, records and accounts by the administering agency and the Secretary of Labor for purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with such rules, regulations and orders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with the nondiscrimination clauses of this contract or with any of the said rules, regulations or orders, this contract may be canceled, terminated or suspended in whole or in part and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts or federally assisted

construction contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and such other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, or by rule, regulation or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as otherwise provided by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(7)</em> The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (7) in every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by rules, regulations or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 204 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as the administering agency may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions, including sanctions for noncompliance: Provided, however, That in the event a contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of such direction by the agency, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.</p><p class="depth2">Except in special cases and in subcontracts for the performance of construction work at the site of construction, the clause is not required to be inserted in subcontracts below the second tier. Subcontracts may incorporate by reference the equal opportunity clause.</p><p class="depth2">The undersigned further agrees that it will be bound by the above equal opportunity clause in any federally assisted construction work which it performs itself other than through the permanent work force directly employed by an agency of Government.</p><p class="depth2">The undersigned agrees that it will cooperate actively with the administering agency and the Secretary of Labor in obtaining the compliance of contractors and subcontractors with the equal opportunity clause and the rules, regulations and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor, that it will furnish the administering agency and the Secretary of Labor such information as they may require for the supervision of such compliance, and that it will otherwise assist the administering agency in the discharge of the agency's primary responsibility for securing compliance. The undersigned further agrees that it will refrain from entering into any contract or contract modification subject to Executive Order 11246 with a contractor debarred from, or who has not demonstrated eligibility for, Government contracts and federally assisted construction contracts pursuant to Part II, Subpart D of Executive Order 11246 and will carry out such sanctions and penalties for violation of the equal opportunity clause as may be imposed upon the contractors and subcontractors by the administering agency or the Secretary of Labor pursuant to Part II, Subpart D of Executive Order 11246.</p><p class="depth2">In addition, the undersigned agrees that if it fails or refuses to comply with these undertakings such failure or refusal shall be a proper basis for cancellation by the Department of Veterans Affairs of any outstanding master certificates of reasonable value or individual certificates of reasonable value relating to proposed construction, except in respect to cases in which an eligible veteran has contracted to purchase a property included on such certificates, and for the rejection of future requests submitted by the undersigned or on his or her behalf for site approval, appraisal services, and direct loan fund reservation commitments until satisfactory assurance of future compliance has been received from the undersigned, and for referral of the case to the Department of Justice for appropriate legal proceedings.
