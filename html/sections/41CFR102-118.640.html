Lacking a satisfactory response,  GSA may place a complete stop order against amounts otherwise payable to  the indebted TSP by adding the name of that TSP to the Department of the  Army ``List of Contractors Indebted to the United States''; and/or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When collection actions, as stated in paragraphs (a) through (c)  of this section are unsuccessful, GSA may report the debt to the  Department of Justice for collection, litigation, and related  proceedings, as prescribed in 4 CFR parts 101 through 105.</p>
