These students' IEPs must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Include IEP goals that are based on the academic content standards for the grade in which a student is enrolled; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Be designed to monitor a student's progress in achieving the student's standards-based goals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ensure that students who are assessed based on modified academic achievement standards have access to the curriculum, including instruction, for the grade in which the students are enrolled;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Ensure that students who take alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards are not precluded from attempting to complete the requirements, as defined by the State, for a regular high school diploma; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Ensure that each IEP team reviews annually for each subject, according to the criteria in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, its decision to assess a student based on modified academic achievement standards to ensure that those standards remain appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Subjects without standards. If an LEA serves students under subpart A of this part in subjects for which a State has not developed academic standards, the State must describe in its State plan a strategy for ensuring that those students are taught the same knowledge and skills and held to the same expectations in those subjects as are all other students.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Other subjects with standards. If a State has developed standards in other subjects for all students, the State must apply those standards to students participating under subpart A of this part.
