                            <p class="depth0">Under certain circumstances, delegates to a convention of a national or international labor organization, or to an intermediate body, must be elected by secret ballot among the members in good standing of the labor organization they represent even though such delegates are not ``officers'' of the organization. Such election is required by the Act \19\ when the delegates are to nominate or elect officers of a national or international labor organization, or of an intermediate body. There is, of course, no requirement that delegates be elected in accordance with the provisions of title IV if they do not nominate or elect officers, unless delegates are designated as ``officers'' in the union's constitution and bylaws or unless, by virtue of their position, they serve as members of the executive board or similar governing body of the union.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\19\ Act, sec. 401(a) and 401(d) (29 U.S.C. 481).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
