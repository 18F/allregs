The method used to simulate critical engine failure must represent the most critical mode of powerplant failure expected in service with respect to controllability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> VMC for takeoff must not exceed 1.2 VS1, where VS1 is determined at the maximum takeoff weight.

VMCG is the minimum control speed on the ground, and is the calibrated airspeed during the takeoff run at which, when the critical engine is suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain control of the airplane using the rudder control alone (without the use of nosewheel steering), as limited by 150 pounds of force, and using the lateral control to the extent of keeping the wings level to enable the takeoff to be safely continued. In the determination of VMCG, assuming that the path of the airplane accelerating with all engines operating is along the centerline of the runway, its path from the point at which the critical engine is made inoperative to the point at which recovery to a direction parallel to the centerline is completed may not deviate more than 30 feet laterally from the centerline at any point.
