                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. You may use a nonmethane cutter to measure  CH4 with a FID analyzer. A nonmethane cutter oxidizes all  nonmethane hydrocarbons to CO2 and H2O. You may  use a nonmethane cutter for raw or diluted exhaust for batch or  continuous sampling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> System performance. Determine nonmethane-cutter performance as  described in Sec.  1065.365 and use the results to calculate  CH4 or NMHC emissions in Sec.  1065.660.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Configuration. Configure the nonmethane cutter with a bypass  line if it is needed for the verification described in Sec.  1065.365.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Optimization. You may optimize a nonmethane cutter to maximize  the penetration of CH4 and the oxidation of all other  hydrocarbons. You may humidify a sample and you may dilute a sample with  purified air or oxygen (O2) upstream of the nonmethane cutter  to optimize its performance. You must account for any sample  humidification and dilution in emission calculations.  [70 FR 40516, July 13, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 37300, June 30, 2008;  76 FR 57442, Sept. 15, 2011]</p>
