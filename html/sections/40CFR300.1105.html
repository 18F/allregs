The HRS serves as a screening device to evaluate the potential for releases of uncontrolled hazardous substances to cause human health or environmental damage. The HRS provides a measure of relative rather than absolute risk. It is designed so that it can be consistently applied to a wide variety of sites.</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Acute toxicity: Measure of toxicological responses that result from a single exposure to a substance or from multiple exposures within a short period of time (typically several days or less). Specific measures of acute toxicity used within the HRS include lethal dose50 (LD50) and lethal concentration50 (LC50), typically measured within a 24-hour to 96-hour period.</p><p class="depth0">Ambient Aquatic Life Advisory Concentrations (AALACs): EPA's advisory concentration limit for acute or chronic toxicity to aquatic organisms as established under section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, as amended.</p><p class="depth0">Ambient Water Quality Criteria (AWQC): EPA's maximum acute or chronic toxicity concentrations for protection of aquatic life and its uses as established under section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, as amended.</p><p class="depth0">Bioconcentration factor (BCF): Measure of the tendency for a substance to accumulate in the tissue of an aquatic organism. BCF is determined by the extent of partitioning of a substance, at equilibrium, between the tissue of an aquatic organism and water. As the ratio of concentration of a substance in the organism divided by the concentration in water, higher BCF values reflect a tendency for substances to accumulate in the tissue of aquatic organisms. [unitless].</p><p class="depth0">Biodegradation: Chemical reaction of a substance induced by enzymatic activity of microorganisms.</p><p class="depth0">CERCLA: Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (Pub. L. 96-510, as amended).</p><p class="depth0">Chronic toxicity: Measure of toxicological responses that result from repeated exposure to a substance over an extended period of time (typically 3 months or longer). Such responses may persist beyond the exposure or may not appear until much later in time than the exposure. HRS measures of chronic toxicity include Reference Dose (RfD) values.</p><p class="depth0">Contract Laboratory Program (CLP): Analytical program developed for CERCLA waste site samples to fill the need for legally defensible analytical results supported by a high level of quality assurance and documentation.</p><p class="depth0">Contract-Required Detection Limit (CRDL): Term equivalent to contract-required quantitation limit, but used primarily for inorganic substances.</p><p class="depth0">Contract-Required Quantitation Limit (CRQL): Substance-specific level that a CLP laboratory must be able to routinely and reliably detect in specific sample matrices. It is not the lowest detectable level achievable, but rather the level that a CLP laboratory should reasonably quantify. The CRQL may or may not be equal to the quantitation limit of a given substance in a given sample. For HRS purposes, the term CRQL refers to both the contract-required quantitation limit and the contract-required detection limit.</p><p class="depth0">Curie (Ci): Measure used to quantify the amount of radioactivity. One curie equals 37 billion nuclear transformations per second, and one picocurie (pCi) equals 10-12 Ci.</p><p class="depth0">Decay product: Isotope formed by the radioactive decay of some other isotope. This newly formed isotope possesses physical and chemical properties that are different from those of its parent isotope, and may also be radioactive.</p><p class="depth0">Detection Limit (DL): Lowest amount that can be distinguished from the normal random ``noise'' of an analytical instrument or method. For HRS purposes, the detection limit used is the method detection limit (MDL) or, for real-time field instruments, the detection limit of the instrument as used in the field.</p><p class="depth0">Dilution weight: Parameter in the HRS surface water migration pathway that reduces the point value assigned to targets as the flow or depth of the relevant surface water body increases. [unitless].</p><p class="depth0">Distance weight: Parameter in the HRS air migration, ground water migration, and soil exposure pathways that reduces the point value assigned to targets as their distance increases from the site. [unitless].</p><p class="depth0">Distribution coefficient (Kd): Measure of the extent of partitioning of a substance between geologic materials (for example, soil, sediment, rock) and water (also called partition coefficient). The distribution coefficient is used in the HRS in evaluating the mobility of a substance for the ground water migration pathway.

[milligrams toxicant per kilogram body weight per day (mg/kg-day)].</p><p class="depth0">Removal action: Action that removes hazardous substances from the site for proper disposal or destruction in a facility permitted under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or the Toxic Substances Control Act or by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p><p class="depth0">Roentgen (R): Measure of external exposures to ionizing radiation. One roentgen equals that amount of x-ray or gamma radiation required to produce ions carrying a charge of 1 electrostatic unit (esu) in 1 cubic centimeter of dry air under standard conditions. One microroentgen ([micro]R) equals 10-6 R.</p><p class="depth0">Sample quantitation limit (SQL): Quantity of a substance that can be reasonably quantified given the limits of detection for the methods of analysis and sample characteristics that may affect quantitation (for example, dilution, concentration).</p><p class="depth0">Screening concentration: Media-specific benchmark concentration for a hazardous substance that is used in the HRS for comparison with the concentration of that hazardous substance in a sample from that media. The screening concentration for a specific hazardous substance corresponds to its reference dose for inhalation exposures or for oral exposures, as appropriate, and, if the substance is a human carcinogen with a weight-of-evidence classification of A, B, or C, to that concentration that corresponds to its 10-6 individual lifetime excess cancer risk for inhalation exposures or for oral exposures, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">Site: Area(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has otherwise come to be located.

The HRS site score (S) is the result of an evaluation of four pathways:</p><p class="depth0">Ground Water Migration (Sgw).</p><p class="depth0">Surface Water Migration (Ssw).</p><p class="depth0">Soil Exposure (Ss).</p><p class="depth0">Air Migration (Sa).</p><p class="depth0">The ground water and air migration pathways use single threat evaluations, while the surface water migration and soil exposure pathways use multiple threat evaluations. Three threats are evaluated for the surface water migration pathway: drinking water, human food chain, and environmental. These threats are evaluated for two separate migration components--overland/flood migration and ground water to surface water migration. Two threats are evaluated for the soil exposure pathway: resident population and nearby population.</p><p class="depth0">The HRS is structured to provide a parallel evaluation for each of these pathways and threats. This section focuses on these parallel evaluations, starting with the calculation of the HRS site score and the individual pathway scores.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.1 Calculation of HRS site score. Scores are first calculated for the individual pathways as specified in sections 2 through 7 and then are combined for the site using the following root-mean-square equation to determine the overall HRS site score, which ranges from 0 to 100:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31AU93.056</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2 Calculation of pathway score. Table 2-1, which is based on the air migration pathway, illustrates the basic parameters used to

calculate a pathway score. As table 2-1 shows, each pathway (or threat) score is the product of three ``factor categories'': likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets. (The soil exposure pathway uses likelihood of exposure rather than likelihood of release.) Each of the three factor categories contains a set of factors that are assigned numerical values and combined as specified in sections 2 through 7. The factor values are rounded to the nearest integer, except where otherwise noted.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3 Common evaluations. Evaluations common to all four HRS pathways include:</p><p class="depth0">Characterizing sources.

-Determining level of contamination for targets.</p><p class="depth0">These evaluations are essentially identical for the three migration pathways (ground water, surface water, and air). However, the evaluations differ in certain respects for the soil exposure pathway.</p><p class="depth0">Section 7 specifies modifications that apply to each pathway when evaluating sites containing radioactive substances.</p><p class="depth0">Section 2 focuses on evaluations common at the pathway and threat levels. Note that for the ground water and surface water migration pathways, separate scores are calculated for each aquifer (see section 3.0) and each watershed (see sections 4.1.1.3 and 4.2.1.5) when determining the pathway scores for a site. Although the evaluations in section 2 do not vary when different aquifers or watersheds are scored at a site, the specific factor values (for example, observed release, hazardous waste quantity, toxicity/mobility) that result from these evaluations can vary by aquifer and by watershed at the site. This can occur through differences both in the specific sources and targets eligible to be evaluated for each aquifer and watershed and in whether observed releases can be established for each aquifer and watershed. Such differences in scoring at the aquifer and watershed level are addressed in sections 3 and 4, not section 2.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Characterize sources. Source characterization includes identification of the following:</p><p class="depth0">Sources (and areas of observed contamination) at the site.</p><p class="depth0">Hazardous substances associated with these sources (or areas of observed contamination).</p><p class="depth0">Pathways potentially threatened by these hazardous substances.</p><p class="depth0">Table 2-2 presents a sample worksheet for source characterization.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.1 Identify sources.

For each of the three migration pathways, consider those hazardous substances documented in a source (for example, by sampling, labels, manifests, oral or written statements) to be associated with that source when evaluating each pathway. In some instances, a hazardous substance can be documented as being present at a site (for example, by labels, manifests, oral or written statements), but the specific source(s) containing that hazardous substance cannot be documented. For the three migration pathways, in those instances when the specific source(s) cannot be documented for a hazardous substance, consider the hazardous substance to be present in each source at the site, except sources for which definitive information indicates that the hazardous substance was not or could not be present.</p><p class="depth0">For an area of observed contamination in the soil exposure pathway, consider only those hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination for that area (see section 5.0.1) to be associated with that area when evaluating the pathway.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.3 Identify hazardous substances available to a pathway. In evaluating each migration pathway, consider the following hazardous substances available to migrate from the sources at the site to the pathway:</p><p class="depth0">Ground water migration.

-All hazardous substances associated with a source with a ground water containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 3.1.2.1).</p><p class="depth0">Surface water migration--overland/flood component.
-Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to surface water in the watershed being evaluated.-All hazardous substances associated with a source with a surface water containment factor value greater than 0 for the watershed (see sections 4.1.2.1.2.1.1 and 4.1.2.1.2.2.1).</p><p class="depth0">Surface water migration--ground water to surface water component.
-Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to ground water.
-All hazardous substances associated with a source with a ground water containment factor value greater than 0 (see sections 4.2.2.1.2 and 3.1.2.1).</p><p class="depth0">Air migration.
-Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to the atmosphere.-All gaseous hazardous substances associated with a source with a gas containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 6.1.2.1.1).-All particulate hazardous substances associated with a source with a particulate containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 6.1.2.2.1).</p><p class="depth0">For each migration pathway, in those instances when the specific source(s) containing the hazardous substance cannot be documented, consider that hazardous substance to be available to migrate to the

pathway when it can be associated (see section 2.2.2) with at least one source having a containment factor value greater than 0 for that pathway.</p><p class="depth0">In evaluating the soil exposure pathway, consider the following hazardous substances available to the pathway:</p><p class="depth0">Soil exposure--resident population threat.
-All hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination at the site (see section 5.0.1).</p><p class="depth0">Soil exposure--nearby population threat.
-All hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination at areas with an attractiveness/accessibility factor value greater than 0 (see section 5.2.1.1).</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Likelihood of release. Likelihood of release is a measure of the likelihood that a waste has been or will be released to the environment. The likelihood of release factor category is assigned the maximum value of 550 for a migration pathway whenever the criteria for an observed release are met for that pathway. If the criteria for an observed release are met, do not evaluate potential to release for that pathway. When the criteria for an observed release are not met, evaluate potential to release for that pathway, with a maximum value of 500. The evaluation of potential to release varies by migration pathway (see sections 3, 4 and 6).</p><p class="depth0">Establish an observed release either by direct observation of the release of a hazardous substance into the media being evaluated (for example, surface water) or by chemical analysis of samples appropriate to the pathway being evaluated (see sections 3, 4, and 6). The minimum standard to establish an observed release by chemical analysis is analytical evidence of a hazardous substance in the media significantly above the background level.

The target distance limit defines the maximum distance from the sources at the site over which targets are evaluated. Use a target distance limit of 4 miles for the ground water migration pathway, except when aquifer discontinuities apply (see section 3.0.1.2.2). Furthermore, consider any well with an observed release from a source at the site (see section 3.1.1) to lie within the target distance limit of the site, regardless of the well's distance from the sources at the site.</p><p class="depth0">For sites that consist solely of a contaminated ground water plume with no identified source, begin measuring the 4-mile target distance limit at the center of the area of observed ground water contamination. Determine the area of observed ground water contamination based on available samples that meet the criteria for an observed release.</p><p class="depth0">3.0.1.2 Aquifer boundaries. Combine multiple aquifers into a single hydrologic unit for scoring purposes if aquifer interconnections can be established for these aquifers. In contrast, restrict aquifer boundaries if aquifer discontinuities can be established.</p><p class="depth0">3.0.1.2.1 Aquifer interconnections. Evaluate whether aquifer interconnections occur within 2 miles of the sources at the site. If they occur within this 2-mile distance, combine the aquifers having interconnections in scoring the site. In addition, if observed ground water contamination attributable to the sources at the site extends beyond 2 miles from the sources, use any locations within the limits of this observed ground water contamination in evaluating aquifer interconnections. If data are not adequate to establish aquifer interconnections, evaluate the aquifers as separate aquifers.</p><p class="depth0">3.0.1.2.2 Aquifer discontinuities. Evaluate whether aquifer discontinuities occur within the 4-mile target distance limit. An aquifer discontinuity occurs for scoring purposes only when a geologic, topographic, or other structure or feature entirely transects an aquifer within the 4-mile target distance limit, thereby creating a continuous boundary to ground water flow within this limit. If two or more aquifers can be combined into a single hydrologic unit for scoring purposes, an aquifer discontinuity occurs only when the structure or feature entirely transects the boundaries of this single hydrologic unit.</p><p class="depth0">When an aquifer discontinuity is established within the 4-mile target distance limit, exclude that portion of the aquifer beyond the discontinuity in evaluating the ground water migration pathway. However, if hazardous substances have migrated across an apparent discontinuity within the 4-mile target distance limit, do not consider this to be a discontinuity in scoring the site.</p><p class="depth0">3.0.1.3  Karst aquifer. Give a karst aquifer that underlies any portion of the sources at

the site special consideration in the evaluation of two potential to release factors (depth to aquifer in section 3.1.2.3 and travel time in section 3.1.2.4), one waste characteristics factor (mobility in section 3.2.1.2), and two targets factors (nearest well in section 3.3.1 and potential contamination in section 3.3.2.4).</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Likelihood of release. For an aquifer, evaluate the likelihood of release factor category in terms of an observed release factor or a potential to release factor.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Observed release. Establish an observed release to an aquifer by demonstrating that the site has released a hazardous substance to the aquifer. Base this demonstration on either:</p><p class="depth0">Direct observation--a material that contains one or more hazardous substances has been deposited into or has been observed entering the aquifer.</p><p class="depth0">Chemical analysis--an analysis of ground water samples from the aquifer indicates that the concentration of hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly above the background concentration for the site (see section 2.3). Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the site to establish the observed release, except: when the source itself consists of a ground water plume with no identified source, no separate attribution is required.</p><p class="depth0">If an observed release can be established for the aquifer, assign the aquifer an observed release factor value of 550, enter this value in table 3-1, and proceed to section 3.1.3. If an observed release cannot be established for the aquifer, assign an observed release factor value of 0, enter this value in table 3-1, and proceed to section 3.1.2.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 Potential to release. Evaluate potential to release only if an observed release cannot be established for the aquifer. Evaluate potential to release based on four factors: containment, net precipitation, depth to aquifer, and travel time. For sources overlying karst terrain, give any karst aquifer that underlies any portion of the sources at the site special consideration in evaluating depth to aquifer and travel time, as specified in sections 3.1.2.3 and 3.1.2.4.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2.1 Containment. Assign a containment factor value from table 3-2 to each source at the site. Select the highest containment factor value assigned to those sources with a source hazardous waste quantity value of 0.5 or more (see section 2.4.2.1.5). (Do not include this minimum size requirement in evaluating any other factor of this pathway.) Assign this highest value as the containment factor value for the aquifer being evaluated. Enter this value in Table 3-1.</p><p class="depth0">If no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, then select the highest value assigned to the sources at the site and assign it as the containment factor value for the aquifer being evaluated. Enter this value in table 3-1.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2.2 Net precipitation. Assign a net precipitation factor value to the site.

Determine the area of observed sediment contamination based on available samples that meet the criteria for an observed release.
Note that the hazardous substance migration path for these contaminated sediment sites consists solely of the in-water segment defined by the target distance limit; there is no overland segment.</p><p class="depth0">For these contaminated sediment sites, include only those targets (for example, intakes, fisheries, sensitive environments) that are within or contiguous to the hazardous substance migration path and located, wholly or partially, within the target distance limit for the site.

Evaluate the drinking water threat for each watershed based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.2.1 Drinking water threat--likelihood of release. Evaluate the likelihood of release factor category for each watershed in terms of an observed release factor or a potential to release factor.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.2.1.1 Observed release. Establish an observed release to surface water for a watershed by demonstrating that the site has released a hazardous substance to the surface water in the watershed. Base this demonstration on either:</p><p class="depth0">Direct observation:
-A material that contains one or more hazardous substances has been seen entering surface water through migration or is known to have entered surface water through direct deposition, or-A source area has been flooded at a time that hazardous substances were present, and one or more hazardous substances were in contact with the flood waters, or
-When evidence supports the inference of a release of a material that contains one or more hazardous substances by the site to surface water, demonstrated adverse effects associated with that release may also be used to establish an observed release.</p><p class="depth0">Chemical analysis:
-Analysis of surface water, benthic, or sediment samples indicates that the concentration of hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly above the background concentration for the site for that type of sample (see section 2.3).</p><p class="depth0">-Limit comparisons to similar types of samples and background concentrations--for example, compare surface water samples to surface water background concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">-For benthic samples, limit comparisons to essentially sessile organisms.-Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the site to establish the observed release, except: when the site itself consists of contaminated sediments with no identified source, no separate attribution is required.</p><p class="depth0">If an observed release can be established for a watershed, assign an observed release factor value of 550 to that watershed, enter this value in table 4-1, and proceed to section 4.1.2.1.3. If no observed release can be established for the watershed, assign an observed release factor value of 0 to that watershed, enter this value in table 4-1, and proceed to section 4.1.2.1.2.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.2.1.2 Potential to release. Evaluate potential to release only if an observed release cannot be established for the watershed. Evaluate potential to release based on two components: potential to release by overland flow (see section 4.1.2.1.2.1) and potential to release by flood (see section 4.1.2.1.2.2). Sum the values for these two components to obtain the potential to release factor value for the watershed, subject to a maximum value of 500.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.2.1.2.1 Potential to release by overland flow. Evaluate potential to release by overland flow for the watershed based on three factors: containment, runoff, and distance to surface water.</p><p class="depth0">Assign potential to release by overland flow a value of 0 for the watershed if:</p><p class="depth0">No overland segment of the hazardous substance migration path can be defined for the watershed, or</p><p class="depth0">The overland segment of the hazardous substance migration path for the watershed exceeds 2 miles before surface water is encountered.
If either condition applies, enter a value of 0 in table 4-1 and proceed to section 4.1.2.1.2.2 to evaluate potential to release by flood. If neither applies, proceed to section 4.1.2.1.2.1.1 to evaluate potential to release by overland flow.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.2.1.2.1.1 Containment. Determine the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">If one or more sources is located in surface water in the watershed (for example, intact sealed drums in surface water), assign

the containment factor a value of 10 for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.</p><p class="depth0">If none of the sources is located in surface water in the watershed, assign a containment factor value from table 4-2 to each source at the site that can potentially release hazardous substances to the hazardous substance migration path for this watershed. Assign the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:
-Select the highest containment factor value assigned to those sources that meet the minimum size requirement described below. Assign this highest value as the containment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.-If, for this watershed, no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, then select the highest containment factor value assigned to the sources at the site eligible to be evaluated for this watershed and assign it as the containment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.</p><p class="depth0">A source meets the minimum size requirement if its source hazardous waste quantity value (see section 2.4.2.1.5) is 0.5 or more. Do not include the minimum size requirement in evaluating any other factor of this surface water migration component, except potential to release by flood as specified in section 4.1.2.1.2.2.3.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.2.1.2.1.2 Runoff.

Calculate ground water to surface water migration component scores only for surface waters (see section 4.0.2) for which all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0">A portion of the surface water is within 1 mile of one or more sources at the site having a containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 4.2.2.1.2).</p><p class="depth0">No aquifer discontinuity is established between the source and the portion of the surface water within 1 mile of the source (see section 3.0.1.2.2). However, if hazardous substances have migrated across an apparent discontinuity within this 1 mile distance, do not consider a discontinuity present in scoring the site.</p><p class="depth0">The top of the uppermost aquifer is at or above the bottom of the surface water.</p><p class="depth0">Do not evaluate this component for sites consisting solely of contaminated sediments with no identified source.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1.2 Definition of hazardous substance migration path for ground water to surface water migration component. The hazardous substance migration path includes both the ground water segment and the surface water in-water segment that hazardous substances would take as they migrate away from sources at the site:</p><p class="depth0">Restrict the ground water segment to migration via the uppermost aquifer between a source and the surface water.</p><p class="depth0">Begin the surface water in-water segment at the probable point of entry from the uppermost aquifer to the surface water. Identify the probable point of entry as that point of the surface water that yields the shortest straight-line distance, within the aquifer boundary (see section 3.0.1.2), from the sources at the site with a containment factor value greater than 0 to the surface water.
-For rivers, continue the in-water segment in the direction of flow (including any tidal flows) for the distance established by the target distance limit (see section 4.2.1.4).-For lakes, oceans, coastal tidal waters, or Great Lakes, do not consider flow direction. Instead apply the target distance limit as an arc.-If the in-water segment includes both rivers and lakes (or oceans, coastal tidal waters, or Great Lakes), apply the target distance limit to their combined in-water segments.</p><p class="depth0">Consider a site to be in two or more watersheds for this component if two or more hazardous substance migration paths from the sources at the site do not reach a common point within the target distance limit.

Section 4.2.2.1.1 specifies the criteria for assigning values to the observed release factor for the ground water to surface water migration component. With regard to an individual hazardous substance, consider an observed release of that hazardous substance to be established for the surface water in-water segment of the ground water to surface water migration component only when the hazardous substance meets the criteria both for an observed release both to ground water (see section 4.2.2.1.1) and for an observed release by chemical analysis to surface water (see section 4.1.2.1.1).</p><p class="depth0">If the hazardous substance meets the section 4.1.2.1.1 criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis to surface water but does not also meet the criteria for an observed release to ground water, do not use any samples of that hazardous substance from the surface water in-water segment in evaluating the factors of this component (for example, do not use the hazardous substance in establishing targets subject to actual contamination or in determining the level of actual contamination for a target).</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1.4 Target distance limit. Determine the target distance limit for each watershed as specified in section 4.1.1.2, except: do not extend the target distance limit to a sample location beyond 15 miles unless at least one hazardous substance in a sample from that location meets the criteria in section 4.2.1.3 for an observed release to the surface water in-water segment.</p><p class="depth0">Determine the targets eligible to be evaluated for each watershed and establish whether these targets are subject to actual or potential contamination as specified in section 4.1.1.2, except: do not establish actual contamination based on a sample location unless at least one hazardous substance in a sample from that location meets the criteria in section 4.2.1.3 for an observed release to the surface water in-water segment.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1.5 Evaluation of ground water to surface water migration component.

Evaluate the soil exposure pathway based on areas of observed contamination:</p><p class="depth0">Consider observed contamination to be present at sampling locations where analytic evidence indicates that:

-For all sources except contaminated soil, if observed contamination from the site is present at any sampling location within the source, consider that entire source to be an area of observed contamination.-For contaminated soil, consider both the sampling location(s) with observed contamination from the site and the area lying between such locations to be an area of observed contamination, unless available information indicates otherwise.</p><p class="depth0">If an area of observed contamination (or portion of such an area) is covered by a permanent, or otherwise maintained, essentially impenetrable material (for example, asphalt) that is not more than 2 feet thick, exclude that area (or portion of the area) in evaluating the soil exposure pathway.</p><p class="depth0">For an area of observed contamination, consider only those hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination for that area to be associated with that area in evaluating the soil exposure pathway (see section 2.2.2).</p><p class="depth0">If there is observed contamination, assign scores for the resident population threat and

the nearby population threat, as specified in sections 5.1 and 5.2.

Evaluate the likelihood of release factor category in terms of an observed release factor or a potential to release factor.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1 Observed release. Establish an observed release to the atmosphere by demonstrating that the site has released a hazardous substance to the atmosphere. Base this demonstration on either:</p><p class="depth0">Direct observation--a material (for example, particulate matter) that contains one or more hazardous substances has been seen entering the atmosphere directly. When evidence supports the inference of a release of a material that contains one or more hazardous substances by the site to the atmosphere, demonstrated adverse effects accumulated with that release may be used to establish an observed release.</p><p class="depth0">Chemical analysis--an analysis of air samples indicates that the concentration of ambient hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly above the background concentration for the site (see section 2.3). Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the site to establish the observed release.</p><p class="depth0">If an observed release can be established, assign an observed release factor value of 550, enter this value in table 6-1, and proceed to section 6.1.3.

For each source (or area of observed contamination) containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, calculate two source hazardous waste quantity values--one based on radionuclides as specified in sections 7.2.5.1 through 7.2.5.1.3 and the other based on the nonradioactive hazardous substances as specified in sections 2.4.2.1 through 2.4.2.1.5 (that is, determine each value as if the other type of substance was not present).

For radioactive substances, evaluate the targets factor category as specified in section 2.5 and sections 3 through 6, except: establish Level I and Level II concentrations at sampling locations as specified in sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2.</p><p class="depth0">For all pathways (and threats), use the same target distance limits for sites containing radioactive substances as is specified in sections 3 through 6 for sites containing nonradioactive hazardous substances. At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, include all sources (or areas of observed contamination) at the site in identifying the applicable targets for the pathway.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 Level of contamination at a sampling location. Determine whether Level I or Level II concentrations apply at a sampling location (and thus to the associated targets) as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Select the benchmarks from section 7.3.2 applicable to the pathway (or threat) being evaluated.</p><p class="depth0">Compare the concentrations of radionuclides in the sample (or comparable samples) to their benchmark concentrations for the pathway (or threat) as specified in section 7.3.2. Treat comparable samples as specified in section 2.5.1.</p><p class="depth0">Determine which level applies based on this comparison.</p><p class="depth0">If none of the radionuclides eligible to be evaluated for the sampling location have an applicable benchmark, assign Level II to the actual contamination at that sampling location for the pathway (or threat).</p><p class="depth0">In making the comparison, consider only those samples, and only those radionuclides in the sample, that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination) for the pathway, except: tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may also be used for the human food chain threat of the surface water pathway as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 Comparison to benchmarks. Use the following media specific benchmarks (expressed in activity units, for example, pCi/l for water, pCi/kg for soil and for aquatic human food chain organisms, and pCi/m3 for air) for making the comparisons for the indicated pathway (or threat):</p><p class="depth0">Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)--ground water migration pathway and drinking water threat in surface water migration pathway.</p><p class="depth0">Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) standards--soil exposure pathway only.</p><p class="depth0">Screening concentration for cancer corresponding to that concentration that corresponds to the 10-6 individual cancer risk for inhalation exposures (air migration pathway) or for oral exposures (ground water migration pathway; drinking water or human food chain threats in surface water migration pathway; and soil exposure pathway).
-For the soil exposure pathway, include two screening concentrations for cancer--one for ingestion of surface materials and one for external radiation exposures from

gamma-emitting radionuclides in surface materials.</p><p class="depth0">Select the benchmark(s) applicable to the pathway (or threat) being evaluated. Compare the concentration of each radionuclide from the sampling location to its benchmark concentration(s) for that pathway (or threat). Use only those samples and only those radionuclides in the sample that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination) for the pathway, except: tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may be used as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3. If the concentration of any applicable radionuclide from any sample equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, consider the sampling location to be subject to Level I concentrations for that pathway (or threat). If more than one benchmark applies to the radionuclide, assign Level I if the radionuclide concentration equals or exceeds the lowest applicable benchmark concentration. In addition, for the soil exposure pathway, assign Level I concentrations at the sampling location if measured gamma radiation exposure rates equal or exceed 2 times the background level (see section 7.1.1).</p><p class="depth0">If no radionuclide individually equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, but more than one radionuclide either meets the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination) for the sample or is eligible to be evaluated for a tissue sample (see sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3), calculate a value for index I for these radionuclides as specified in section 2.5.2. If I equals or exceeds 1, assign Level I to the sampling location. If I is less than 1, assign Level II.</p><p class="depth0">At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, establish the level of contamination for each sampling location considering radioactive substances and nonradioactive hazardous substances separately. Compare the concentration of each radionuclide and each nonradioactive hazardous substance from the sampling location to its respective benchmark concentration(s). Use only those samples and only those substances in the sample that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination) for the pathway except: tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may be used as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3. If the concentration of one or more applicable radionuclides or other hazardous substances from any sample equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, consider the sampling location to be subject to Level I concentrations. If more than one benchmark applies to a radionuclide or other hazardous substance, assign Level I if the concentration of the radionuclide or other hazardous substance equals or exceeds its lowest applicable benchmark concentration.</p><p class="depth0">If no radionuclide or other hazardous substance individually exceed a benchmark concentration, but more than one radionuclide or other hazardous substance either meets the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination) for the sample or is eligible to be evaluated for a tissue sample, calculate an index I for both types of substances as specified in section 2.5.2. Sum the index I values for the two types of substances. If the value, individually or combined, equals or exceeds 1, assign Level I to the sample location. If it is less than 1, calculate an index J for the nonradioactive hazardous substances as specified in section 2.5.2. If J equals or exceeds 1, assign Level I to the sampling location. If J is less than 1, assign Level II.

The methods described below apply to ``dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, and miscellaneous oil spill control agents'' involving subpart J (Use of Dispersants and Other Chemicals) in 40 CFR part 300 (National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan). They are revisions and additions to the EPA's Standard Dispersant Effectiveness and Toxicity Tests (1). The new Swirling Flask Dispersant Effectiveness Test is used only for testing dispersants. The Revised Standard Dispersant Toxicity Test is used for testing dispersants, as well as surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, and miscellaneous oil spill control agents. The bioremediation agent effectiveness test is used for testing bioremediation agents only.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Definitions. The definitions of dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, and miscellaneous oil spill control agents are provided in 40 CFR 300.5.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Swirling Flask Dispersant Effectiveness Test</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Summary of Method. This protocol was developed by Environment Canada to provide a relatively rapid and simple testing procedure for evaluating dispersant effectiveness (2). It uses a modified Erlenmeyer flask to which a side spout has been added for removing subsurface samples of water near the bottom of the flask without disturbing a surface oil layer. Seawater and a surface layer of oil are added to the flask. Turbulent mixing is provided by placing the flask on a standard shaker table at 150 rpm for 20 minutes to induce a swirling motion to the liquid contents. Following shaking, the flask is immediately removed from the shaker table and maintained in a stationary position for 10 minutes to allow the oil that will reform a slick to return to the water's surface. A sample of water for chemical analysis is then removed from the bottom of the flask through the side spout, extracted with methylene chloride (dichloromethane-DCM), and analyzed for oil content by UV-visible absorption spectrophotometry at wavelengths of 340, 370, and 400 nm (2).</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Apparatus.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.1 Modified Erlenmeyer Flask. Use 125-ml glass Erlenmeyer flasks that have been modified to include an attachment of a glass side spout that extends from the bottom of the flask upward to the neck region, as shown in Figure 1.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2 Shaker Table. Use a shaker table with speed control unit with variable speed (40-400 rpm) and an orbital diameter of approximately 0.75 inches (2 cm) to provide turbulence to solutions in test flasks.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.3 Spectrophotometer. Use a UV-visible spectrophotometer capable of measuring absorbance at 340, 370, and 400 nm. A Hitachi Model U-2000 or equivalent is acceptable for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.4 Glassware. Glassware should consist of 5-, 10-, 25-, 100-, and 500-ml graduated cylinders; 125-ml separatory funnels with Teflon stopcocks; and 10-, 100-, and 1,000-ml volumetric flasks and micropipettes.

For experiments with no dispersant, only oil is used to make the standard solution. For experiments with the oil plus dispersant, the standard is made with a 1:10 (v:v) mixture of the dispersant to the test oil (i.e., a dispersant-to-oil ratio of 1:10). This ratio is used in the test tank with dispersant added. The presence of water and certain dispersants in DCM extracts can affect absorbance readings in a spectrophotometer. All standard solutions of oil (and dispersant, if present) should be prepared in a stepwise manner that reflects the analytical protocol used for the experimental water samples.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.1.2 To prepare the standards, prepare a parent oil-DCM standard by mixing 1 part oil (plus \1/10\ part premixed dispersant, if applicable) to 9 parts DCM (i.e., 1:10 dilution of the oil v:v). Add a specific volume of the parent oil-DCM standard to 30 ml of synthetic seawater in a separatory funnel. Extract the oil-water mixture with 5-ml volumes of DCM after 15 seconds of vigorous shaking followed by a 2 minute stationary period to allow for phase separation for each extraction. Repeat the extraction using a total of three 5-ml portions of DCM. Adjust the final DCM volume for the combined extracts to 20 ml with DCM in a 25-ml graduated cylinder.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.1.3 The quantities of oil used to achieve the desired concentrations in the final 20-ml DCM extracts for the standard oil-solutions are summarized in table 3. Specific masses for oil amounts in standards are determined as volumes of oil multiplied by the density of the oil.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.2 Linear stability calibration of UV-Visible spectrophotometer.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.2.1 Before DCM-extracts of dispersed oil-water samples can be analyzed for their oil content, the UV-visible spectrophotometer must meet an instrument stability calibration criterion. This criterion is determined with the six oil standards identified in table 3. Determine the absorbance of standards at each of the three analytical wavelengths (i.e., 340, 370, and 400 nm). Determine the response factors (RFs) for the test oil at each of the three analytical wavelengths using the following equation:
RFx=C/Ax (1)
where:RFx=Response factor at wavelength x (x=340, 370, or 400 nm)C=Oil concentration, in mg of oil/ml of DCM in standard solutionAx=Spectrophotometric absorbance of wavelength x

If this criterion is satisfied, analysis of sample extracts can begin. RFs for the lowest concentration (0.05 mg oil/ml DCM) are not included in the consideration because the absorbance is close to the detection limit of the spectrophotometer (with associated high variability in the value) for the 1-cm path-length cell used for measurements.

In addition, attempts will be made to correlate the difference to oil type, dispersant test, or dispersant used. If no errors or correlations are apparent and 10% of all oil measurements are flagged, the mean concentration data will be used in the calculation for dispersant performance and the subject data will be flagged.</p><p class="depth0">17.

At least 5% of all UV-visible spectrophotometric measurements will be performed in duplicate as a QC check on the analytical measurement method. The absorbance values for the duplicates should agree within 5% of their mean value.</p><p class="depth0">2.7.2 Method blanks. Analytical method blanks involve an analysis of seawater blanks (i.e., seawater but no oil or dispersant in a swirling flask vessel) through testing and analytical procedures (3, pp 79-80). Method blanks are analyzed with a frequency of at least 1 for every 12 experimental swirling flask samples. Oil concentrations in method blanks must be <5% of that occurring for 100% dispersion of oil in testing apparatus.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Revised standard dispersant toxicity test</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Summary of method. The standard toxicity test for dispersants and other products involves exposing two species (Menidia beryllina (silversides) and Mysidopsis bahia (mysid shrimp)) to five concentrations of the test product and No. 2 fuel oil alone and in a 1:10 mixture of product to oil. To aid in comparing results from assays performed by different workers, reference toxicity tests are conducted using dodecyl sodium sulfate (DSS) as a reference toxicant. The test length is 96 hours for Menidia and 48 hours for Mysidopsis. LC50 s are calculated based on mortality data at the end of the exposure period (for method of calculation, see section 3.6 below).</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Selection and preparation of test materials.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1 Test organisms.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.1 Menidia beryllina. Obtain fish (silversides) from a single source for each series of toxicity tests. In-house cultures are recommended wherever it is cost-effective; however, organisms are available from commercial suppliers. Information on the source of test organisms and any known unusual condition to which fish were exposed before use should be included in the data report. Use of animals previously treated with pesticides or chemotherapeutic agents should be avoided. Organisms should not be used if they appear to be unhealthy, discolored, or show signs of stress. Use 7-day old larval fish. Fish should be cultured in accordance with the methods outlined in Middaugh, et al. (5). There should be no need to acclimate organisms to the 251 [deg]C temperature recommended for the toxicity tests if laboratory stock cultures of Menidia are maintained at the recommended culture temperature of 251 [deg]C. If test organisms must be obtained from a commercial source, it may become necessary to acclimate test fish to the test temperature of 251 [deg]C, a pH of 8.00.2, and 202 ppt salinity since changes in temperature may occur during shipping. Eliminate groups of fish having a mortality of more than 10% during the first 48 hours, and more than 5% thereafter. During acclimation, organisms should be maintained on a diet of freshly hatched Artemia (brine shrimp) nauplii. Feed the fish daily to satiation during the acclimation period, and once daily during the 96-hour test. Care should be taken daily to remove excess food and fecal material from beakers during the test. Use only those organisms that feed actively and that appear to be healthy. Organisms should be free of disease, external parasites, and any signs of physical damage or stress. Discard any fish injured or dropped while handling.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1.2 Mysidopsis bahia. Several methods for culturing Mysidopsis bahia (mysid shrimp) may be used and are noted in appendix A of Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms (6). To ensure uniformity of mysids, recently hatched mysids should be collected daily from stock cultures and identified by the date of hatch. Mysids used in 48-hour tests should be from a single day's collection, but may have an age range of 5-7 days old. In cases where in-house cultures of mysids are unavailable, organisms may be purchased from a commercial source. Information on the source of test organisms should be submitted in the data report.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.2 Preparation of experimental water. Filtered natural seawater is recommended for use since it represents a natural source of saltwater containing an inherent population of microorganisms. Synthetic seawater formulated according to the following method can serve as an acceptable alternative to filtered, natural seawater for toxicity tests

performed in laboratories in which natural seawater is unavailable.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.3 Synthetic seawater formation. To prepare standard seawater, mix technical-grade salts with 900 liters of distilled or demineralized water in the order and quantities listed in table 4. These ingredients must be added in the order listed and each ingredient must be dissolved before another is added. Stir constantly after each addition during preparation until dissolution is complete. Add distilled or demineralized water to make up to 1,000 liters. The pH should now be 8.00.2. To attain the desired salinity of 201 ppt, dilute again with distilled or demineralized water at time of use.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Sampling and storage of test materials. Toxicity tests are performed with No. 2 fuel oil having the characteristics defined in table 5. Store oil used for toxicity tests in sealed containers to prevent the loss of volatiles and other changes. For ease in handling and use, it is recommended that 1,000-ml glass containers be used. To ensure comparable results in the bioassay tests, use oils packaged and sealed at the source. Dispose of unused oil in each open container on completion of dosing to prevent its use at a later date when it may have lost some of its volatile components. Run all tests in a bioassay series with oil from the same container and with organisms from the same group collected or secured from the same source.</p><p class="depth0">Table 4--Synthetic Seawater</p><p class="depth0">[Toxicity Test]------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Salt                               (g) \1\------------------------------------------------------------------------NaF........................................................          1.9SrCl2 [middot] 6H2O........................................         13.0H3 BO2.....................................................         20.0KBr........................................................         67.0KCl........................................................        466.0CaC12 [middot] 2H2O........................................        733.0Na2 SO4....................................................      2,660.0MgCl2 [middot] 6H2O........................................      3,330.0NaCl.......................................................     15,650.0Na2SiO3 [middot] 9H2O......................................         13.0EDTA \2\...................................................          0.4NaHCO3.....................................................        133.0------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ Amount added to 900 liters of water, as described in the text.\2\ Ethylenediaminetetraacetate tetrasodium salt.</p><p class="depth0">3.4 General test conditions and procedures for toxicity tests.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.1 Temperature. For these toxicity tests, use test solutions with temperatures of 251 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.2 Dissolved oxygen and aeration.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.2.1 Menidia. Because oils contain toxic, volatile materials, and because the toxicity of some water-soluble fractions of oil and degradation products are changed by oxidation, special care must be used in the oxygenation of test solutions. Aeration during the test is generally not recommended but should be used to maintain the required dissolved oxygen (DO) in cases where low DO is observed. The DO content of test solutions must not drop below 60% saturation during the first 48 hours of a static acute (96-hour) test and must remain between 40-100% after the first 48 hours of the test. Aeration at a rate of 10015 bubbles per minute is supplied by a serological pipette as needed for maintenance of DO. If aeration is necessary, all test chambers should be aerated. At this rate, and with the proper weight of fish, DO concentration should remain slightly above 4 ppm over a 96-hour period. Take DO measurements daily.</p><p class="depth0">Table 5--Test Oil Characteristics: No. 2 Fuel Oil------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Characteristic                      Minimum   Maximum------------------------------------------------------------------------Gravity ([deg]API)..................................     32.1      42.8Viscosity kinematic at 100 [deg]F (cs)..............      2.35      3.00Flash point ([deg]F)................................    150          ...Pour point ([deg]F).................................       ...      0Cloud point ([deg]F)................................       ...     10Sulfur (wt %).......................................       ...      0.35Aniline point ([deg]F)..............................    125       180Carbon residue (wt %)...............................       ...      0.16Water (vol %).......................................       ...      0Sediment (wt %).....................................       ...      0Aromatics (vol %)...................................     10        15Distillation:</p><p class="depth0">IBP ([deg]F).......................................    347       407</p><p class="depth0">10% ([deg]F).......................................    402       456</p><p class="depth0">50% ([deg]F).......................................    475       530</p><p class="depth0">90% ([deg]F).......................................    542       606</p><p class="depth0">End Point ([deg]F).................................    596       655Neutralization No...................................       ...      0.05------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3.4.2.2 Mysidopsis. Achieve sufficient DO by ensuring that the surface area to volume ratio of the test solution exposed is large enough. Oxygen content should remain high throughout the test because of the low oxygen demand of the organisms. Aeration is not recommended during 48-hour acute toxicity tests unless the DO falls below 60% saturation.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.3 Controls. With each fish or mysid test or each series of simultaneous tests of different solutions, perform a concurrent control test in exactly the same manner as the other tests and under the conditions prescribed or selected for those tests. Use the diluent water alone as the medium in which the controls are held. There must be no more than 10% mortality among the controls during the course of any valid test.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.4 Reference toxicant. To aid in comparing results from tests performed by different workers and to detect changes in the condition of the test organisms that might lead to different results, perform reference toxicity tests with reagent grade DSS in addition to the usual control tests. Prepare a stock solution of DSS immediately before use by adding 1 gram of DSS per 500 ml of test water solution. Use exploratory tests before the full scale tests are begun to determine the

amount of reference standard to be used in each of the five different concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.5 Number of organisms. At a minimum, 20 organisms of a given species are exposed for each test concentration. For the toxicity test procedures using Menidia, place 10 fish in each of two jars. For the toxicity tests using Mysidopsis, place 10 larvae in each of two containers.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.6 Transfer of organisms. Organisms should be handled as little as possible in order to minimize stress. Transfer Menidia and Mysidopsis from the acclimatization aquaria to the test chambers with a pipette or a wide-bore, smooth glass tube (4 to 8 mm internal diameter) fitted with a rubber bulb. Dip nets should be avoided when handling larval fish and mysids. Do not hold fish out of the water longer than necessary and discard any specimen accidentally dropped or otherwise mishandled during transfer.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.6.1 Mysidopsis. To have the mysids ready for study, mysids may be sorted 24 hours prior to initiation of the 48-hour test. Transfer the mysids to a beaker containing a small volume of water; this vessel serves as a holding chamber during randomized transfer of the organisms to test solutions. Mysids are randomly selected from the batch of mysids in the holding chamber, and transferred to 50-ml beakers containing a small volume of seawater. One mysid is added per beaker using a small piece of flexible 500-[micro]m screening until all of the beakers contain one mysid. The process of random selection and sorting is continued until the appropriate number of mysids has been delivered to each of the 50-ml beakers. The mysids are gently released from the 50-ml beakers into larger beakers filled with an appropriate volume of 20-ppt seawater (25 [deg]C) to bring the total volume to 200 ml. The beakers are randomly placed into a temperature-controlled water bath to acclimate overnight at 25 [deg]C. The mysids are transferred to larger beakers (1-liter) for the 48-hour test after the addition of 800 ml of the test solution. A total of 10 mysids per beaker are used for 48-hour acute toxicity tests. A minimum of two replicate chambers are used for each test concentration and control.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.6.2 Menidia and Mysidopsis are fed 50 brine shrimp nauplii/organism daily during the 96-hour and 48-hour tests. Excess food should be removed daily by aspirating with a pipette.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.7 Test duration and observations. 3.4.7.1 Menidia. Observe the number of dead fish in each test container and record at the end of each 24-hour period. Fish are considered dead upon cessation of respiratory and all other overt movements, whether spontaneous or in response to mild mechanical prodding. Remove dead fish as soon as observed. Also note and report when the behavior of test fish deviates from that of control fish. Such behavioral changes would include variations in opercular movement, coloration, body orientation, movement, depth in container, schooling tendencies, and others. Abnormal behavior of the test organisms (especially during the first 24 hours) is a desirable parameter to monitor in a toxicity test because changes in behavior and appearance may precede mortality. Toxicants can reduce an organism's ability to survive natural stresses. In these cases, the mortality is not directly attributed to the toxicant, but most certainly is an indirect effect. Reports on behavioral changes during a toxicity test can give insight into the non-acute effects of the tested material. At the end of the 96-hour period, terminate the fish tests and determine the LC50 values. The acute toxicity test is terminated after four days of exposure. The number of surviving fish are counted and recorded for each chamber in accordance with standard EPA methods (6). The LC50 is calculated using survival data from the test in accordance with the methods described in the guidelines (6).</p><p class="depth0">3.4.7.2 Mysidopsis. Terminate the mysid test after 48 hours of incubation. To count the dead animals accurately, place the exposure vessels on a light table such that light passes through the bottom of the vessel. Most of the dead mysids will be on the bottom of the beaker and can readily be seen against the background of the light table. Also search the top of the liquid for mysids trapped there by surface tension. Exercise caution when determining death of the animals. Occasionally, an animal appears dead, but closer observation shows slight movement of an appendage or a periodic spasm of its entire body. For these tests, animals exhibiting any movement when touched with a pipette tip are considered alive. Account for all test animals to ensure accuracy since Mysidopsis bahia may disintegrate or be cannibalized by other mysids. Consider individuals not accounted for as dead. At the end of 48 hours of exposure, terminate the mysid assay and determine the LC50 values in accordance with the methods described in the guidelines (6).</p><p class="depth0">3.4.8 Physical and chemical determinations. 3.4.8.1 Menidia. Determine the temperature, DO, and pH of the test solutions before the fish are added and at 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-hour exposure intervals. It is necessary to take measurements from only one of the replicates of each of the toxicant series.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.8.2 Mysidopsis. Determine the temperature, DO, and pH of the test solutions before the nauplii are added and at the 24- and 48-hour exposure interval. Measure DO and pH in only one of the replicates of each of the toxicant series.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.9 Testing laboratory. An ordinary heated or air-conditioned laboratory room with thermostatic controls suitable for maintaining the prescribed test temperatures generally will suffice to conduct the toxicity

tests. Where ambient temperatures cannot be controlled to 251 [deg]C, use water baths with the necessary temperature controls.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.10 Test containers. For tests with fish or mysids, use 1-liter glass beakers measuring approximately 10 cm in diameter. In conducting the test, add to each beaker 1 liter of the test solution or seawater formulation aerated to saturation with DO. To add the liter volume easily and accurately, use a large volume (1-liter) graduated cylinder. Process all required glassware before each test. Immerse in normal hexane for 10 minutes. Follow this with a thorough rinse with hot tap water; three hot detergent scrubs; an additional hot tap-water rinse; and three rinses with distilled water. Oven or air dry the glassware in a reasonably dust-free atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0">3.5 Preparation of test concentrations. 3.5.1 Menidia. Place test jars (approximately 22.5 cm in height, 15 cm in diameter, 11 cm in diameter at the mouth) containing 2 liters of synthetic seawater on a reciprocal shaker. The shaker platform should be adapted to hold firmly six of the toxicity test jars. Add the desired amount of the petroleum product (if applicable) under test directly to each test jar. Dispense the appropriate amount of toxicant (if applicable) into the jars with a pipette. Tightly cap the test jars and shake for 5 minutes at approximately 315 to 333 2-cm (0.75-inch) strokes per minute in a reciprocal shaker or at approximately 150 to 160 rpm on orbital shakers. At the completion of shaking, remove the jars from the shaker and dispense 1 liter of the mixture to each of the 1-liter glass beakers. Randomly place beakers in a constant-temperature water bath or room, take water quality measurements, add fish, and initiate aeration.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2 Mysidopsis. 3.5.2.1 To prepare test solutions for products and oil/product mixtures, blend or mix the test solutions with an electric blender having: speeds of 10,000 rpm or less; a stainless-steel cutting assembly; and a 1-liter borosilicate jar. To minimize foaming, blend at speeds below 10,000 rpm.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2.2 For the product test solution, add 550 ml of the synthetic seawater to the jar, then with the use of a gas-tight calibrated glass syringe with a Teflon-tipped plunger, add 0.55 ml of the product and mix for 5 seconds.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2.3 For the oil test solution, add 550 ml of the synthetic seawater to the jar. Then with the use of a gas-tight calibrated glass syringe equipped with a Teflon-tipped plunger, add 0.55 ml of the oil and mix for 5 seconds.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2.4 For the oil/product mixture, add 550 ml of the synthetic seawater to the mixing jar. While the blender is in operation, add 0.5 ml of the oil under study with the use of a calibrated syringe with a Teflon-tipper plunger and then 0.05 ml of the product as indicated above. Blend for 5 seconds after addition of product. These additions provide test solutions of the product, oil, and the oil/product mixture at concentrations of 1,000 ppm.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2.5 Immediately after the test solutions are prepared, draw up the necessary amount of test solution with a gas-tight Teflon-tipped glass syringe of appropriate size and dispense into each of the five containers in each series. If the series of five concentrations to be tested are 10, 18, 32, 56, and 100 ppm, the amount of the test solution in the order of the concentrations listed above would be as follows: 10, 18, 32, 56, and 100 ml.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2.6 Each time a syringe is to be filled for dispensing to the series of test containers, start the mixer and withdraw the desired amount in the appropriate syringe while the mixer is in operation. Turn off immediately after the sample is taken to limit the loss of volatiles.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2.7 Use exploratory tests before the full-scale test is set up to determine the concentration of toxicant to be used in each of the five different concentrations. After adding the required amounts of liquid, bring the volume in each of the test containers up to 800 ml with the artificial seawater. To ensure keeping each of the series separate, designate on the lid of each container the date, the material under test, and its concentration.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2.8 When the desired concentrations are prepared, gently release into each beaker the 10 test Mysidopsis (previously transferred into 200 ml of medium). This provides a volume of 1 liter in each test chamber. A pair of standard cover glass forceps with flat, bent ends is an ideal tool for handling and tipping the small beaker without risk of contaminating the medium.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2.9 After adding the test animals, incubate the test beakers at 251 [deg]C for 48 hours. Recommended lighting is 2,000 lumens/m2 (200 ft-c) of diffused, constant, fluorescent illumination.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2.10 Wash the blender thoroughly after use and repeat the above procedures for each series of tests. Wash the blender as follows: rinse with normal hexane; pour a strong solution of laboratory detergent into the blender to cover the blades; fill the container to about half of its volume with hot tap water; operate the blender for about 30 seconds at high speed; remove and rinse twice with hot tap water, mixing each rinse for 5 seconds at high speed; and then rinse twice with distilled water, mixing each rinse for 5 seconds at high speed.</p><p class="depth0">3.6 Calculating and reporting. At the end of the test period, the toxicity tests are terminated and the LC50 values are determined.</p><p class="depth0">3.6.1 Calculations. The LC50 is the concentration lethal to 50% of the test population. It can be calculated as an interpolated value based on percentages of organisms surviving at two or more concentrations, at which less than half and more than half survived. The LC50 can be estimated with the aid of computer programs or graphic techniques (log paper). The 95% confidence intervals for the LC50 estimate should also be determined.</p><p class="depth0">3.6.2 Reporting. The test product and oil and their source and storage are described in the toxicity test report. Note any observed changes in the experimental water or the test solutions. Also include the species of fish used; the sources, size, and condition of the fish; data of any known treatment of the fish for disease or infestation with parasites before their use; and any observations on the fish behavior at regular intervals during the tests. In addition to the calculated LC50 values, other data necessary for interpretation (e.g., DO, pH, other physical parameters, and the percent survival at the end of each day of exposure at each concentration of toxicant) should be reported.</p><p class="depth0">3.7 Summary of procedures. 3.7.1 Menidia:</p><p class="depth0">1. Prepare adequate stocks of the appropriate standard dilution water.</p><p class="depth0">2. Add 2 liters of the standard dilution water to the test jars. Each test consists of 5 replicates of each of 5 concentrations of the test material, a control series of 5 beakers, and a standard reference series of 5 different concentrations for a total of 35 beakers. Simultaneous performance of toxicity tests on the oil, product, and oil/product mixture requires a total of 105 beakers.</p><p class="depth0">3. Add the determined amount (quarter points on the log scale) of test material to the appropriate jars.

Remove the jars from the shaker, take water quality data, dispense 1 liter of solution to the 1-liter glass beaker, and add 10 acclimated fish per beaker.</p><p class="depth0">6. Aerate with 10015 bubbles per minute through a 1-ml serological pipette, as needed, to maintain DO above 4.0 mg/l.</p><p class="depth0">7.

After 96 hours, terminate the test, and calculate LC50 values and corresponding confidence limits.</p><p class="depth0">3.7.2 Mysidopsis:</p><p class="depth0">1. Initiate the procedure for hatching the Mysidopsis in sufficient time before the toxicity test is to be conducted so that 5-7 day old larvae are available.</p><p class="depth0">2. With the use of a small pipette, transfer 10 Mysidopsis into small beakers, each containing 200 ml of the proper synthetic seawater.</p><p class="depth0">3. To prepare the test stock product and oil solutions, add 550 ml of the artificial seawater to the prescribed blender jar. By means of a gas-tight glass syringe with a Teflon-tipped plunger, add 0.55 ml of the product (or oil) and mix at 10,000 rpm for 5 seconds. To prepare the test stock oil/product mixture, add 550 ml of the standard seawater to the blender jar. While the blender is in operation (10,000 rpm), add 0.5 ml of the oil, then 0.05 ml of the product with the use of a calibrated syringe with a Teflon-tipped plunger. Blend for 5 seconds after adding the product. One ml of these stock solutions added to the 100 ml of standard seawater in the test containers yields a concentration of 10 ppm product, oil, or oil/product combination (the test will be in a ratio of 1 part product to 10 parts of oil).</p><p class="depth0">4. Each test consists of 5 replications of each of 5 concentrations of the material under study, a control series of 5 beakers and a standard reference series of 5 different concentrations, for a total of 35 beakers. Simultaneous performance of toxicity tests on the oil, product, and oil/product mixture requires a total of 105 beakers. Immediately after preparing the test solution of the product or oil/product solution, and using an appropriately sized syringe, draw up the necessary amount of test solution and dispense into each of the five containers in each series. Each time a syringe is to be filled for dispensing to the series of test containers, start the mixer and withdraw the desired amount in the appropriate syringe while the mixer is in operation. Turn mixer off immediately after the sample is taken to limit the loss of volatiles. After adding the required amount of the test oil/product or product mixture, bring the volume of liquid in each of the test containers up to 800 ml with the artificial seawater. When the desired concentrations have been prepared, gently release into each beaker the 10 mysids previously transferred into 200 ml of medium. This provides a volume of 1 liter in each test chamber.</p><p class="depth0">5. Wash the blender as prescribed for each series of tests.</p><p class="depth0">6.

The bioremediation agent effectiveness testing protocol is designed to determine a product's ability to biodegrade oil by quantifying changes in the

oil composition resulting from biodegradation. The protocol tests for microbial activity and quantifies the disappearance of saturated hydrocarbons and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The sample preparation procedure extracts the oil phase into dichloromethane (DCM), with a subsequent solvent exchange into hexane. To effectively accomplish the goals of the testing protocol, it is necessary to normalize the concentration of the various analytes in oil to a non-biodegradable marker, either C2-or C3-phenanthrene, C2-chrysene, or hopane \1\ (7). The test method targets the relatively easy to degrade normal alkanes and the more resistant and toxic PAHs. It normalizes their concentrations to C2-or C3-phenanthrene, C2-chrysene, or C3017[alpha](H), 21[beta] (H)-hopane on an oil weight basis (mg marker/kg oil, mg target analyte/kg oil). The analytical technique uses a high resolution gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) because of its high degree of chemical separation and spectral resolution. GC/MS has long been used to study the weathering and fate of oil spilled into the environment. For quantitative analyses, the instrument is operated in the selective ion detection (SIM) mode at a scan rate of greater than 1.5 scans per second to maximize the linear quantitative range and precision of the instrument. The sample preparation method does not exclude analysis of selected samples by GC/MS in the full scanning mode of operation to qualitatively assess changes in the oil not accounted for by the SIM approach. Performed concurrently with the chemical analysis described above is a microbiological analysis. The microbiological analysis is performed to determine and monitor the viability of the microbial cultures being studied. Under this procedure, microbial enumerations of hydrocarbon degraders are performed at each sampling event using a microtiter Most Probable Number (MPN) determination.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Although any of these biomarkers can be used to conduct this test, it is recommended that hopane be used.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Apparatus. The following materials and equipment are required for the protocol: Appropriate flasks and other glassware; sterile tubes; graduated cylinders (100-ml); deionized water; p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet dye; weighing pans or paper; 250-ml borosilicate glass Erlenmeyer flasks with screw tops; Pasteur pipettes; laboratory notebook; microtiter MPN plates (24-well) multi-channel pipetting device; dilution tube and caps; autoclave; environmental room or incubator; balance accurate to 0.1 mg (XD-400); GC/MS instrument equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m, 0.25-mm I.D., and 0.25-[micro]m film thickness) and a split/splitless injection port operating in the splitless mode, such as Hewlett-Packard 5890/5971 GC/MS (recommended for use); and an autosampler for testing multiple samples.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Reagents and culture medium. 4.3.1 Preparation of seawater. All products are tested in clean natural seawater. Clean natural seawater means that the source of this seawater must not be heavily contaminated with industrial or other types of effluent. For example, seawater should not be obtained from a source near shipping channels or discharges of industrial or municipal wastewater, or with high turbidity. The seawater is used within seven days of collection. No microbial inoculum is added.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.2 Preparation of oil. A medium weight crude oil, Alaska North Slope (ANS), is artificially weathered by heating to 521 [deg]F to remove the light end hydrocarbons prior to experimental start-up (ANS 521). The method is described in the Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 8708 ``Crude Petroleum Oil--Determination of Distillation Characteristics Using 15 Theoretical Plates Columns'' by the International Organization for Standardization (8). The ANS521 crude oil can be obtained from the National Environmental Technology Applications Center's (NETAC) Bioremediation Products Evaluation Center (BPEC), University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center, 615 William Pitt Way, Pittsburgh, PA, 15238, (412) 826-5511. The crude oil is heated to 190 [deg]C (374 [deg]F) under atmospheric pressure. The system is then cooled and placed under vacuum (or under an atmospheric pressure of 20 mm Hg) for the final distillation to an atmospheric equivalent boiling point of 272 [deg]C (521 [deg]F).</p><p class="depth0">4.3.3 Preparation of mineral nutrient solution.

The appropriate amount of oil (0.5 g) is added drop by drop using a sterile Pasteur pipette with the tip broken off to provide a wider opening. Care is taken to avoid splashing the oil or getting it on the sides of flasks. Precautions are taken when handling and charging the flasks to minimize the likelihood of contamination by exogenous microbes. This includes using a new sterile pipette for each series of flasks.</p><p class="depth0">8. The weight of the oil is recorded in the laboratory notebook.</p><p class="depth0">9.

Specific procedures for both the microbiological and chemical analysis are described below. At the time of each sampling event, physical observations of each flask should be recorded.</p><p class="depth0">4.5 Microbiological analysis. To monitor the viability of the microbial cultures being studied, microbial enumerations of hydrocarbon degraders are performed at each sampling event using a microtiter MPN determination.

After 0, 7, and 28 days of incubation on a rotary shaker, the appropriate flasks are sacrificed and extracted with dichloromethane and spiked with a surrogate recovery standard. A 10-ml aliquot of the DCM layer is used for the gravimetric analysis. If significant biodegradation is evident in the results of the gravimetric analysis, then a solvent exchange into hexane takes place prior to the GC/MS analysis. Follow steps 1-19 below when preparing for the chemical analysis.</p><p class="depth0">1. After 0, 7, and 28 days of rotary shaking and incubating at 20 [deg]C, the reaction vessels are sacrificed. Prior to the chemical analysis, a 0.5-ml sample of the aqueous phase is removed for the microbiological analysis (see Microbial Enumeration above).</p><p class="depth0">2. A surrogate recovery standard is prepared in the following manner: 1,000 mg of d10-phenanthrene and 1,000 mg of 5[alpha]-androstane are measured into a 500-ml volumetric flask and DCM is added to the mark to produce a 2,000-ng/[micro]l stock solution.</p><p class="depth0">3. A 100-[micro]l aliquot of the surrogate solution is added to each test flask. The final concentration of surrogates in each flask is approximately 4 ng/[micro]l of solvent in the final extract. The aliphatics and marker data should be corrected for percent recovery of the 5[alpha]-androstane surrogate and the aromatics for the d10-phenanthrene surrogate.</p><p class="depth0">4. The contents of the flask are placed into a 250-ml separatory funnel.</p><p class="depth0">5. Measure a total volume of 50 ml DCM for use in the extraction. Use 3 10-ml fractions to rinse the flask into the funnel and transfer the remaining aliquot of DCM to the funnel.</p><p class="depth0">6. Stopper and mix vigorously by shaking (approximately 50 times) while ventilating properly.</p><p class="depth0">7. Each funnel is set aside to allow the DCM and water layers to partition. This may take 5-10 minutes for some products, or up to 3 hours if the product has caused the formation of an emulsion.</p><p class="depth0">8. Drain the first 10 ml of the DCM (bottom) layer, collect, cap, uniquely label, and use for gravimetric analysis (see below). Drain the remaining 40 ml and dry it by passing it through a funnel packed with anhydrous sodium sulfate.</p><p class="depth0">9. Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (KD) concentrator by attaching a Snyder column to an evaporation flask with a graduated concentrator tube.

Centrifuge to aid the separation of the hexane from the precipitant fraction.</p><p class="depth0">15. Place hexane-soluble fraction (top layer)--approximately 1.0 ml--into a GC/MS vial for analysis (see GC/MS Analysis Procedure below).

Calculate surrogate recovery. If surrogate recovery is less than 85 percent for the marker relative to the surrogate recovery standard (d10-phenanthrene), then the water layer should be extracted again using three separate extractions with DCM. Pool the three extractions with original extract and concentrate to 10 ml, and reanalyze by GC/MS.</p><p class="depth0">18. Drain the seawater into a storage sample vial/container.</p><p class="depth0">19. Seal the vial with a Teflon-lined cap and store frozen. This water layer is kept in case additional extractions are necessary.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.2 Gravimetric analysis. The initial means to evaluate the effectiveness of a bioremediation agent for oil spill response is through gravimetric analysis. A statistically significant difference (p <0.05) in analytical weight

of the oil from the control system as compared to the analytical weight of the oil treated with a bioremediation agent indicates biodegradation has successfully occurred. Hence, the disappearance of oil should be accompanied by significant decreases in total oil residue weight of extractable materials versus a control. If no significant decrease in oil residue weight is observed, the need to perform further chemical analysis should be evaluated. Follow steps 1-3 to conduct the gravimetric analysis.</p><p class="depth0">1. The 10 ml of DCM extract (from Sample Procedure step 8 above) is placed in a small vial and concentrated to dryness by nitrogen blowdown techniques using a steady stream of nitrogen (pre-purified gas). If the oil is severely biodegraded, a larger volume of DCM (10 ml) may be necessary for the gravimetric analysis.</p><p class="depth0">2. The residue is weighed 3 times for the gravimetric weight of oil. Record the weight of the oil.</p><p class="depth0">3. Compare statistically (p <0.05) the weight of the product treatment versus the weight of the control from each respective time period. If a significant decrease is observed in the sampling (flask containing bioremediation agent) weight, then proceed with the remainder of the sample procedure.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.3 GC/MS analysis. Often, analysis of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons by capillary gas chromatography of DCM extracts leads to column fouling and deterioration of separation characteristics. An alternative, simple ``one-step'' alumina sample cleanup procedure can be performed on oil before injection; this cleanup removes both asphaltenes and polar compounds and can be applied to DCM extracts as well. This procedure is described in steps 1-11 below.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.3.1 Alternative GC/MS sample cleanup procedure:</p><p class="depth0">1.

Samples are quantified using the internal standard technique (10) for both the aliphatic and aromatic fractions of the oil extracts in order to provide sufficient information that the oil is being degraded. To help ensure that the observed decline in target analytes is caused by biodegradation rather than by physical loss from mishandling or inefficient extraction, it is necessary to normalize the concentrations of the target analytes via a ``conserved internal marker.'' Conserved internal markers that have been found useful for quantification are C2- or C3-phenanthrene, C2-chrysene, and C3017[alpha](H),21[beta](H)-hopane. Deuterated internal standards are used to calculate the relative response factor (RRF) for the target analyte(s). To compute the ``normalized concentrations,'' the target analyte concentration at a given sampling time is simply divided by the selected conserved analyte concentration at the same sampling time (11). Conduct the GC/MS analysis using the following procedure.</p><p class="depth0">1. One (1) ml of the hexane extract (from Sample Procedure step 15 above) is placed into a 1.5-ml vial for use on the autosampler of the GC/MS instrument.</p><p class="depth0">2. To this solution, 20 [micro]l of a 500-ng/[micro]l solution of the internal standards is added and the vial is capped for injection. The final concentration of the internal standards in each sample is 10 ng/[micro]l. This solution contains 4 deuterated compounds: d8-naphthalene, d10-anthracene, d12-chrysene, and d12-perylene.</p><p class="depth0">3. At the start of any analysis period, the mass spectrometer (MS) is tuned to PFTBA by an autotune program, such as the Hewlett-Packard quicktune routine, to reduce operator variability. Set the GC/MS in the SIM mode at a scan rate of 1.5 scans/second to maximize the linear quantitative range

and precision of the instrument. Set all other conditions to those specified in Instrument Configuration and Calibration section below.</p><p class="depth0">4. An instrument blank and a daily standard are analyzed prior to analysis of unknowns. Internal standards are combined with the sample extracts and coinjected with each analysis to monitor the instrument's performance during each run.</p><p class="depth0">5. Information that should be included on the acquisition form include operator's name and signature, date of extraction, date and time of autotune, date of injection(s), instrument blank, daily standard mix injection, GC column number, and standards for the 5-point calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">6.

Samples are immediately logged into the laboratory, where they will be given a unique sample identification based on Julian data and the number logged in. Prior to the analysis of any experimental samples, a five-point standard curve is prepared. One of the mid-range standard curve concentration levels is analyzed daily before sample analysis as a continuing standard. RRFs for all target analytes should be within 25% of the standard curve response values at day 0, and at any sampling event the check standard percent difference from the initial five-point calibration must not exceed 20% between the

before and after daily standard mix (see below). The collected GC/MS data are initially processed by a macro routine, which performs extracted chromatographic plots of the target compounds, integrates the target compounds, and shows integration results to include tabular numbers. The integration values are then transferred to a spreadsheet format to be quantified. Because of the complexity of the analyte matrix (oil), a very high degree of manual verification and reintegration of the spectral data is required.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.5 QA/QC procedures. The reliability of this method is dependent on the QA/QC procedures followed. Before and after each analytical batch (approximately 10 samples), analyze one procedural blank, one duplicate, and one calibration verification standard (10 ng/[micro]l). Analyze one reference crude oil standard. The instrument's performance and reproducibility are validated routinely in this manner. Surrogate recoveries should be within 70 to 120%, and duplicate relative percent difference values should be 20%. A control chart of the standard oil should be prepared and monitored. Variations of analytes in the control chart should be no more than 25% from the historical averages. Injection port discrimination for n-C25 and greater alkanes must be carefully monitored; the ratio of RRF n-C32/RRF n-C21 alkanes should not be allowed to fall below 80%. The mass discrimination can be reduced by replacing the quartz liner in the injection port after every analytical batch. The instrument's performance and reproducibility are validated routinely by analyzing the reference crude oil standard. All analyses are recorded in instrument logs detailing operating conditions, date and time, file name, etc. After analysis, the sample extracts are archived at refrigeration temperatures. To document QA/QC, the following information is contained in the detailed quantitative reports: average RRF derived from the standard curve; RRF from the daily standard; percent relative standard deviation; area of target analyte; concentration determined both on a weight and volume basis; and values for any surrogates and internal standards.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.6 Instrument configuration and calibration. A 2-ml aliquot of the hexane extract prepared by the above procedure is injected into a GC/MS instrument, such as the Hewlett-Packard 5890/5971 GC/MS (recommended for use). This instrument should be equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m, 0.25-mm I.D., and 0.25-[micro]m film thickness) and a split/splitless injection port operating in the splitless mode. Table 9 summarizes the temperature program used for the analysis. This temperature program has been optimized to give the best separation and sensitivity for analysis of the desired compounds on the instrument. Prior to the sample analysis, a five-point calibration must be conducted on a standard mix of the compounds listed in table 7 to determine RRFs for the analyses.</p><p class="depth0">Table 9--Operating Conditions and Temperature Program of GC/MS------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Operating conditions-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Injector port--290 [deg]C</p><p class="depth0">Transfer line--320 [deg]C</p><p class="depth0">Total run time--73 minutes</p><p class="depth0">Column flow rate (He)--1.0 ml/minute------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Temperature Program-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Temp.

The determination of a bioremediation agent's effectiveness will be partially based upon the results of a statistical analysis of the shaker flask experiment. The experimental design for this test is a two factorial design. This two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to determine data trends. The statistical method is designed to test various types of bioremediation treatments including microbial, nutrient, enzyme, and combination products. The following is a summary of the statistical methods to be used to evaluate the analytical data obtained from all product tests. The experimental design, data analysis methodology, interpretation of results, required documentation, and a numeric example are outlined below.</p><p class="depth0">4.7.1 Experimental design. The experimental design for this test is known as a factorial experiment with two factors. The first factor is product/control group; the second factor is time (measured in days). For example, if two groups (product A and a non-nutrient control) are tested at each of three points in time (day 0, 7, and 28), the experiment is called a 2x3 factorial experiment. There will be three replications (replicated shaker flasks) of each group-time combination.</p><p class="depth0">4.7.2 Data analysis methods. For each analyte and each product used, a product is considered a success by the demonstration of a statistically significant difference between the mean analyte degradation by the product and the mean analyte degradation by the non-nutrient control. Such a determination will be made by performing an ANOVA on the sample data. The technical aspects of this procedure are outlined in Snedecor and Cochran (12). Most statistical software packages support the use of two-way ANOVA. However, the format required for the input data differs among the various commercial packages. Whichever package is used, the following ANOVA table will be provided as part of the output. In the Degree of Freedom

column of table 10, p = the number of product/control groups, t = the number of days at which each group is analyzed, and n = the number of replications. For the example of the 2x3 factorial experiment discussed above, p=2, t=3, and n=3. The significance of the F-statistics (as indicated by their corresponding p-values) are used to interpret the analysis.</p><p class="depth0">Table 10--Two-Way ANOVA Table----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Degree of freedom</p><p class="depth0">Source                    (df)         Sum of squares      Mean square       F-Statistic     p-Value----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Group........................  p-1                SSG               MSG-MSG/MSE       MSG/MSE                \1\Time.........................  t-1                SST               MST-MST/MSE       MST/MSE                \1\Interaction..................

In order to find out which groups and at which points in time the difference occurs, pairwise comparisons between the group means should be conducted for all time points. These comparisons can be made using protected least squared difference (LSD) or Dunnett mean separation techniques. The protected LSD procedure is detailed in Snedecor and Cochran (12); the Dunnett procedure is outlined in Montgomery (13). For both methods, the mean square error (MSE) from the two-way ANOVA table should be used to compute the separation values.</p><p class="depth0">4.7.3.2 If the F-statistic for the interaction is not significant at the 0.05 level (i.e., p-value not less than 0.05), but the F-statistic for the group is significant (i.e., p-value is less than 0.05), the data indicate that any differences that exist among the group means are consistent across time. To find out which group means differ, a pairwise comparison of the group means should be carried out by pooling data across all points in time. Again, the MSE from the two-way ANOVA table should be used to compute the separation values.</p><p class="depth0">4.7.3.3 If the F-statistic corresponding to both interaction and group are not significant at the 0.05 level, the data indicate no difference between the group means at any point in time. In this case, no further analysis is necessary.</p><p class="depth0">4.7.3.4 Finally, Snedecor and Cochran (12) use caution concerning the use of multiple comparisons. If many such comparisons are being conducted, then about 5% of the tested differences will erroneously be concluded as significant. The researcher must guard against such differences causing undue attention.</p><p class="depth0">4.7.4 Required documentation. 4.7.4.1 The following documents should be included to summarize the findings from a product test.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Effectiveness (bioremediation agents). Raw data must be reported according to the format shown below. The first column lists the names of the analytes measured by GC/MS (SIM), the surrogate standards, and various ratios and sums. In the next three columns, the concentration of the analytes (ng/mg oil), the concentration of the analytes corrected for the recovery of the surrogate standard ([alpha]-androstane for alkanes, d10-phenanthrene for aromatics), and the concentration of corrected analytes normalized against the conserved internal marker, respectively, are reported for the first replicate from the first sampling event. These three columns are each repeated for the next two replicates, giving 9 total columns for the product of interest. The next 9 columns are the same as the product columns except they are for the non-nutrient control. The last nine columns are for the nutrient control. Thus, a total of 28 columns are needed in the spreadsheet. This spreadsheet is for the first sampling event (day 0). Two more identical spreadsheets will be needed for each of the next two sampling events (days 7 and 28). For the statistical analysis, a report showing the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) table created by the software used by the investigator must be shown in its entirety along with the name of the software package used. Another printout showing the mean separation table (protected LSD test results) generated by the software must be reported. The statistical analyses are conducted using the sum of the alkane concentrations and the sum of the aromatics concentrations from the raw data table. Thus, two ANOVAs are run for each sampling event, one for total alkanes and one for total aromatics, giving a total of 6 ANOVAs for a product test (2 ANOVAs x 3 sampling events). Only if significant differences are detected by a given ANOVA will it be necessary to run a protected LSD test.</p><p class="depth0">Bioremediation Agent Effectiveness Test Raw Data</p><p class="depth0">[Date: .
