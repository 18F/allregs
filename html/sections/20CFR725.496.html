                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The 1981 amendments to the Act amended section 422 of the Act  and transferred liability for payment of certain special claims from  operators and carriers to the fund. These provisions apply to claims  which were denied before March 1, 1978, and which have been or will be  approved in accordance with section 435 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 402(i) of the Act defines three classes of denied claims  subject to the transfer provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Claims filed with and denied by the Social Security  Administration before March 1, 1978;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Claims filed with the Department of Labor in which the claimant  was notified by the Department of an administrative or informal denial  before March 1, 1977, and in which the claimant did not within one year  of such notification either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Request a hearing; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Present additional evidence; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Indicate an intention to present additional evidence; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Request a modification or reconsideration of the denial on the  ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a  determination of fact;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Claims filed with the Department of Labor and denied under the  law in effect prior to the enactment of the Black Lung Benefits Reform  Act of 1977, that is, before March 1, 1978, following a formal hearing  before an administrative law judge or administrative review before the  Benefits Review Board or review before a United States Court of Appeals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where more than one claim was filed with the Social Security  Administration and/or the Department of Labor prior to March 1, 1978, by  or on behalf of a miner or a surviving dependent of a miner, unless such  claims were required to be merged by the agency's regulations, the  procedural history of each such claim must be considered separately to  determine whether the claim is subject to the transfer of liability  provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For a claim filed with and denied by the Social Security  Administration prior to March 1, 1978, to come within the transfer  provisions, such claim must have been or must be approved under the  provisions of section 435 of the Act. No claim filed with and denied by  the Social Security Administration is subject to the transfer of  liability provisions unless a request was made by or on behalf of the  claimant for review of such denied claim under section 435. Such review  must have been requested by the filing of a valid election card or other  equivalent document with the Social Security Administration in  accordance with section 435(a) and its implementing regulations at 20  CFR 410.700 through 410.707.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where a claim filed with the Department of Labor prior to March  1, 1977, was subjected to repeated administrative or informal denials,  the last such denial issued during the pendency of the claim determines  whether the claim is subject to the transfer of liability provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where a miner's claim comes within the transfer of liability  provisions of the 1981 amendments the fund is also liable for the  payment of any benefits to which the miner's dependent survivors are  entitled after the miner's death. However, if the survivor's entitlement  was established on a separate claim not subject to the transfer of  liability provisions prior to approval of the miner's claim under  section 435, the party responsible for the payment of such survivors'  benefits shall not be relieved of that responsibility because the  miner's claim was ultimately approved and found subject to the transfer  of liability provisions.</p>
