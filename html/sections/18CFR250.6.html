Nature of service sought, giving a brief description of proposal, including location of community, population, number of residences and kind of service sought and to be rendered, showing:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Is this an initial connection with the pipe line, or is it an extension or improvement of existing facilities?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Estimate of maximum day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial customers for each of the first three years of proposed operations (Mcf at 14.73 psia), and how the estimates were derived;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Estimate of annual requirements for residential, commercial and industrial customers for each of the first three years of proposed operations (Mcf at 14.73 psia), and how the estimates were derived.</p><p class="depth0">7.

If you have filed an application for such a franchise, with whom was it filed and what action has been taken on it?</p><p class="depth0">8. Do you have or do you need a state certificate approving the proposed distribution system project? If you have filed an application for such a certificate, with whom was it filed and what action has been taken on it?</p><p class="depth0">9. When do you propose to start construction and when do you estimate it will be completed? When do you propose to start selling gas?</p><p class="depth0">10. How much are the facilities expected to cost? Show separately the estimated cost of the distribution system, the connecting supply lines, legal fees, financing fees and engineering fees, and briefly state how the estimates were derived.</p><p class="depth0">11. Have you used the services of an engineering consultant? If so, the consultant should state his experience in the design of distribution systems, cost data of systems now in service compared with his initial estimates, and the actual rate at which new customers were attached in the new distribution systems.</p><p class="depth0">12. How do you propose to finance the proposed facilities? Submit evidence that the money will be available. (This evidence need not be submitted if you have a state certificate for your project.)</p><p class="depth0">13. For each of the first three years of operation of the proposed facilities, show (a) the estimated gross annual revenues for the natural gas estimated to be sold to residential, commercial and industrial customers as shown in item 6(c) and the rates you propose to charge, and (b) the cost of gas purchased by you (state the rate to be paid to the pipeline supplier and the pipeline's rate schedule under which you will purchase said gas), other operating and maintenance expenses and operating revenue deductions, and (c) the net operating revenues.

A flow diagram showing the maximum daily capacity of the proposed connecting pipeline to carry gas from the supplier to the community to be served. The diagram should show expected operating pressures on the connecting pipeline at the point of connection with the supplier and at the other terminal of the connecting pipeline flow of gas through the connecting pipeline in Mcf per day; length of the connecting pipeline and its inside and outside diameter.
