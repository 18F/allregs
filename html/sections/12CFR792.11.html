                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All records of NCUA or any officer, employee, or agent thereof,  are confidential, privileged and exempt from disclosure, except as  otherwise provided in this subpart, if they are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records specifically authorized under criteria established by an  Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or  foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to an  Executive Order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records related solely to NCUA internal personnel rules and  practices. This exemption applies to internal rules or instructions  which must be kept confidential in order to assure effective performance  of the functions and activities for which NCUA is responsible and which  do not materially affect members of the public. This exemption also  applies to manuals and   instructions to the extent that release of the information would permit  circumvention of laws or regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, where the  statute either makes nondisclosure mandatory or establishes particular  criteria for withholding information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records which contain trade secrets and commercial or financial  information which relate to the business, personal or financial affairs  of any person or organization, are furnished to NCUA, and are  confidential or privileged. This exemption includes, but is not limited  to, various types of confidential sales and cost statistics, trade  secrets, and names of key customers and personnel. Assurances of  confidentiality given by staff are not binding on NCUA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would  not be available by law to a private party in litigation with NCUA. This  exemption preserves the existing freedom of NCUA officials and employees  to engage in full and frank written or taped communications with each  other and with officials and employees of other agencies. It includes,  but is not limited to, inter-agency and intra-agency reports, memoranda,  letters, correspondence, work papers, and minutes of meetings, as well  as staff papers prepared for use within NCUA or in concert with other  governmental agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Personnel, medical, and similar files (including financial  files) pertaining to another person, the disclosure of which would  constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy without  the subject person's written consent or proof of death. Written consent  consists of a written statement by the subject person, authorizing the  release of the information to you, and including either the subject  person's notarized signature or a declaration made under penalty of  perjury that the statement is true and correct. Proof of death consists  of evidence that the subject of your request is deceased--such as a  death certificate, a newspaper obituary, or some comparable proof of  death. Files exempt from disclosure include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The personnel records of the NCUA;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The personnel records voluntarily submitted by private parties  in response to NCUA's requests for proposals; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Files containing reports, records or other material pertaining  to individual cases in which disciplinary or other administrative action  has been or may be taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes,  but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement  records or information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement  proceedings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an  impartial adjudication;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted  invasion of personal privacy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a  confidential source, including a state, local, or foreign agency or  authority or any private institution which furnished information on a  confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled  by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal  investigation on or by an agency conducting a lawful national security  intelligence investigation, information furnished by the confidential  source;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement  investigation or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law  enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could  reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical  safety of any individual. This includes, but is not limited to,  information relating to enforcement proceedings upon which NCUA has  acted or will act in the future.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Contained in or related to examination, operating or condition  reports prepared by, or on behalf of, or for the use of NCUA or any  agency responsible   for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions. This  includes all information, whether in formal or informal report form, the  disclosure of which would harm the financial security of credit unions  or would interfere with the relationship between NCUA and credit unions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We will provide any reasonably segregable portion of a requested  record after deleting those portions that are exempt from disclosure  under this section.
