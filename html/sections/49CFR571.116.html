Determine the wet ERBP of a brake fluid by running duplicate samples according to the following procedure.</p><p class="depth0">S6.2.1. Summary of procedure. A 350 ml. sample of the brake fluid is humidified under controlled conditions; 350 ml. of SAE triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, brake fluid grade, referee material (TEGME) as described in appendix E of SAE Standard J1703 NOV83 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 571.5), is used to establish the end point for humidification. After humidification, the water content and ERBP of the brake fluid are determined.</p><p class="depth0">S6.2.2 Apparatus for humidification. (See Figure 3).</p><p class="depth0">Test apparatus shall consist of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Glass jars. Four SAE RM-49 corrosion test jars or equivalent screwtop, straight-sided, round glass jars each having a capacity of about 475 ml. and approximate inner dimensions of 100 mm. in height by 75 mm. in diameter, with matching lids having new, clean inserts providing water-vapor-proof seals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Desiccator and cover. Two bowl-form glass desiccators, 250-mm. inside diameter, having matching tubulated covers fitted with No. 8 rubber stoppers; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Desiccator plate. Two 230-mm. diameter, perforated porcelain desiccator plates, without feet, glazed on one side.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Distilled water, see S7.1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> SAE TEGME referee material (see appendix E of SAE Standard J1703 NOV83 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 571.5)).</p><p class="depth0">S6.2.4 Preparation of apparatus. Lubricate the ground-glass joint of the desiccator. Pour 450 10 ml. of distilled water into each desiccator and insert perforated porcelain desiccator plates. Place the desiccators in an oven with temperature controlled at 50 1 [deg]C. (122 1.8 [deg]F.) throughout the humidification procedure.</p><p class="depth0">S6.2.5 Procedure. Pour 350 5 ml. of brake fluid into an open corrosion test jar. Prepare in the same manner a duplicate test fluid sample and two duplicate specimens of the SAE TEGME referee material (350 5 ml. of TEGME in each jar). The water content of the SAE TEGME fluid is adjusted to 0.50 0.05 percent by weight at the start of the test in accordance with S7.2. Place one sample each of the test brake fluid and the prepared TEGME sample into the same desiccator. Repeat for the second sample of test brake fluid and TEGME in a second desiccator. Place the desiccators in the 50 [deg]C. (122 [deg]F.) controlled oven and replace desiccator covers. At intervals, during oven humidification, remove the rubber stoppers in the tops of desiccators. Using a long needled hypodermic syringe, take a sample of not more than 2 ml. from each TEGME sample and determine its water content. Remove no more than 10 ml. of fluid from each SAE TEGME sample during the humidification procedure. When the water content of the SAE fluid reaches 3.70 0.05 percent by weight (average of the duplicates). remove the two test fluid specimens from their desiccators and promptly cap each jar tightly. Allow the sealed jars to cool for 60 to 90 minutes at 23[deg] 5 [deg]C. (73.4[deg] 9 [deg]F.). Measure the water contents of the test fluid specimens in accordance with S7.2 and determine their ERBP's in accordance with S6.1. If the two ERBPs agree within 4 [deg]C. (8 [deg]F.), average them to determine the wet ERBP; otherwise repeat and average the four individual ERBPs as the wet ERBP of the brake fluid.

Run duplicate samples at each of the specified temperatures, making two timed runs on each sample.</p><p class="depth0">S6.3.1 Summary of the procedure. The time is measured for a fixed volume of the brake fluid to flow through a calibrated glass capillary viscometer under an accurately reproducible head and at a closely controlled temperature. The kinematic viscosity is then calculated from the measured flow time and the calibration constant of the viscometer.</p><p class="depth0">S6.3.2 Apparatus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Viscometers.

A transparent liquid bath of sufficient depth such that at no time during the measurement will any portion of the sample in the

viscometer be less than 2 cm. below the surface or less than 2 cm. above the bottom. The bath shall be cylindrical in shape, with turbulent agitation sufficient to meet the temperature control requirements. For measurements within 15[deg] to 100 [deg]C. (60[deg] to 212 [deg]F.) the temperature of the bath medium shall not vary by more than 0.01 [deg]C.

Use viscometers calibrated in accordance with appendix 1 of ASTM D445-65 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 571.5). The calibration constant, C, is dependent upon the gravitational acceleration at the place of calibration. This must, therefore, be supplied by the standardization laboratory together with the instrument constant. Where the acceleration of gravity, g, in the two locations differs by more than 0.1 percent, correct the calibration constant as follows:
C2 = (g2/g1) x C1

For measurements below 0 [deg]C.

(32 [deg]F.), before placing the filled viscometer into the constant temperature bath, draw the sample into the working capillary and timing bulb and insert small rubber stoppers to suspend the fluid in this position, to prevent accumulation of water condensate on the walls of the critical portions of the viscometer. Alternatively, fit loosely packed drying tubes into the open ends of the viscometer to prevent water condensation, but do not restrict the flow of the sample under test by the pressures created in the instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a Cannon-Fenske Routine viscometer is used, charge by inverting and immersing the smaller arm into the brake fluid and applying vacuum to the larger arm.

Evaluate the lubricating properties, component compatibility, resistance to leakage, and related qualities of a brake fluid by running one sample according to the following procedures.</p><p class="depth0">S6.13.1 Summary of the procedure. Brake fluid is stroked under controlled conditions at an elevated temperature in a simulated motor vehicle hydraulic braking system consisting of three slave wheel cylinders and an actuating master cylinder connected by steel tubing. Referee standard parts are used. All parts are carefully cleaned, examined, and certain measurements made immediately prior to assembly for test. During the test, temperature, rate of pressure rise, maximum pressure, and rate of stroking are specified and controlled. The system is examined periodically during stroking to assure that excessive leakage of fluid is not occurring. Afterwards, the system is torn down. Metal parts and SBR cups are examined and remeasured. The brake fluid and any resultant sludge and debris are collected, examined, and tested.</p><p class="depth0">S6.13.2 Apparatus and equipment.</p><p class="depth0">Either the drum and shoe type of stroking apparatus (see Figure 1 of SAE Standard J1703b (1970) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 571.5)), except using only three sets of drum and shoe assemblies, or the stroking fixture type apparatus as shown in Figure 2 of SAE Standard J1703 NOV83 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 571.5) with the components arranged as shown in Figure 1 of SAE Standard J1703 NOV83. The following components are required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Brake assemblies. With the drum and shoe apparatus: three drum and shoe assembly units (SAE RM-29a) consisting of three forward brake shoes and three reverse brake shoes with linings and three front wheel brake drum assemblies with assembly component parts. With stroking fixture type apparatus: three fixture units including appropriate adapter mounting plates to hold brake wheel cylinder assemblies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Braking pressure actuation mechanism. An actuating mechanism for applying a force to the master cylinder pushrod without side thrust. The amount of force applied by the actuating mechanism shall be adjustable and capable of applying sufficient thrust to the master cylinder to create a pressure of at least 6895 kPa (1,000 p.s.i.) in the simulated brake system. A hydraulic gage or pressure recorder, having a range of at least 0 to 6895 kPa (0 to 1,000 p.s.i), shall be installed between the master cylinder and the brake assemblies and shall be provided with a shutoff valve and with a bleeding valve for removing air from the connecting tubing. The actuating mechanism shall be designed to permit adjustable stroking rates of approximately 1,000 strokes per hour. Use a mechanical or electrical counter to record the total number of strokes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Heated air bath cabinet. An insulated cabinet or oven having sufficient capacity to house the three mounted brake assemblies or stroking fixture assemblies, master cylinder, and necessary connections. A thermostatically controlled heating system is required to maintain a temperature of 70[deg] 5 [deg]C (158[deg] 9 [deg]F) or 120[deg] 5 [deg]C (248[deg] 9 [deg]F). Heaters shall be shielded to prevent direct radiation to wheel or master cylinder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Master cylinder (MC) assembly (SAE RM-15a). One cast iron housing hydraulic brake system cylinder having a diameter of approximately 28 mm. (1\1/8\ inch) and fitted for a filler cap and standpipe (see S6.13.2(e)).

Cap and standpipe may be cleaned and reused.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Wheel cylinder (WC) assemblies (SAE RM-14a). Three unused cast iron housing straight bore hydraulic brake WC assemblies having diameters of approximately 28 mm (1\1/8\ inch) for each test. Pistons shall be made from unanodized SAE AA 2024 aluminum alloy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Micrometer. Same as S6.6.2(d).</p><p class="depth0">S6.13.3 Materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Standard SBR brake cups. Six standard SAE SBR wheel cylinder test cups, one primary MC test cup, and one secondary MC test cup, all as described in S7.6, for each test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Steel tubing. Double wall steel tubing meeting SAE Standard J527a (1967) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 571.5). A complete replacement of tubing is essential when visual inspection indicates any corrosion or deposits on inner surface of tubing. Tubing from master cylinder to one wheel cylinder shall be replaced for each test (minimum length .9 m.) Uniformity in tubing size is required between master cylinder and wheel cylinder. The standard master cylinder has two outlets for tubing, both of which must be used.</p><p class="depth0">S6.13.4 Preparation of test apparatus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Wheel cylinder assemblies. Use unused wheel cylinder assemblies. Disassemble cylinders and discard cups. Clean all metal parts with ethanol (isopropanol when testing DOT 5 fluids). Inspect the working surfaces of all metal parts for scoring, galling, or pitting and cylinder bore roughness, and discard all defective parts. Remove any stains on cylinder walls with crocus cloth and ethanol (isopropanol when testing DOT 5 fluids). If stains

cannot be removed, discard the cylinder. Measure the internal diameter of each cylinder at a location approximately 19 mm. (0.75 inch) from each end of the cylinder bore, taking measurements in line with the hydraulic inlet opening and at right angles to this centerline. Discard the cylinder if any of these four readings exceeds the maximum or minimum limits of 28.66 to 28.60 mm. (1.128 to 1.126 inch). Measure the outside diameter of each piston at two points approximately 90[deg] apart. Discard any piston if either reading exceeds the maximum or minimum limits of 28.55 to 28.52 mm. (1.124 to 1.123 inch). Select parts to insure that the clearance between each piston and mating cylinder is within 0.08 to 0.13 mm. (0.003 to 0.005 inch). Use unused SBR cups. To remove dirt and debris, rinse the cups in 90 percent ethyl alcohol for not more than 30 seconds and wipe dry with a clean lint-free cloth. Discard any cups showing defects such as cuts, molding flaws, or blisters. Measure the lip and base diameters of all cups with an optical comparator or micrometer to the nearest 0.02 mm. (0.001 inch) along the centerline of the SAE and rubber-type identifications and at right angles to this centerline. Determine base diameter measurements at least 0.4 mm. (0.015 inch) above the bottom edge and parallel to the base of the cup. Discard any cup if the two measured lip or base diameters differ by more than 0.08 mm. (0.003 inch). Average the lip and base diameters of each cup. Determine the hardness of all cups according to S7.4. Dip the rubber and metal parts of wheel cylinders, except housing and rubber boots, in the fluid to be tested and install them in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Manually stroke the cylinders to insure that they operate easily. Install cylinders in the simulated brake system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Master cylinder assembly. Use an unused master cylinder and unused standard SBR primary and secondary MC cups which have been inspected, measured and cleaned in the manner specified in S6.13.4(a), omitting hardness of the secondary MC cup. However, prior to determining the lip and base diameters of the secondary cup, dip the cup in test brake fluid, assemble on the MC piston, and maintain the assembly in a vertical position at 23[deg] 5 [deg]C. (73.4[deg] 9 [deg]F.) for at least 12 hours. Inspect the relief and supply ports of the master cylinder; discard the cylinder if ports have burrs or wire edges. Measure the internal diameter of the cylinder at two locations (approximately midway between the relief and supply ports and approximately 19 mm. (0.75 inch) beyond the relief port toward the bottom or discharge end of the bore), taking measurements at each location on the vertical and horizontal centerline of the bore. Discard the cylinder if any reading exceeds the maximum or minimum limits of 28.65 to 28.57 mm. (1.128 to 1.125 inch). Measure the outside diameter of each end of the master cylinder piston at two points approximately 90[deg] apart. Discard the piston if any of these four readings exceed the maximum or minimum limits of 28.55 to 28.52 mm. (1.124 to 1.123 inch). Dip the rubber and metal parts of the master cylinder, except the housing and push rod-boot assembly, in the brake fluid and install in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. Manually stroke the master cylinder to insure that it operates easily. Install the master cylinder in the simulated brake system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Assembly and adjustment of test apparatus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When using a shoe and drum type apparatus, adjust the brake shoe toe clearances to 1.0 0.1 mm (0.040 0.004 inch). Fill the system with brake fluid, bleeding all wheel cylinders and the pressure gage to remove entrapped air. Operate the actuator manually to apply a pressure greater than the required operating pressure and inspect the system for leaks. Adjust the actuator and/or pressure relief valve to obtain a pressure of 6895 kPa 345 kPa (1,000 50 p.s.i.). A smooth pressure stroke pattern is required when using a shoe and drum type apparatus. The pressure is relatively low during the first part of the stroke and then builds up smoothly to the maximum stroking pressure at the end of the stroke, to permit the primary cup to pass the compensating hole at a relatively low pressure. Using stroking fixtures, adjust the actuator and/or pressure relief valve to obtain a pressure of 6895 kPa 345 kPa (1,000 50 p.s.i.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adjust the stroking rate to 1,000 100 strokes per hour. Record the fluid level in the master cylinder standpipe.</p><p class="depth0">S6.13.5 Procedure. Operate the system for 16,000 1,000 cycles at 23[deg] 5 [deg]C. (73.4[deg] 9 [deg]F.). Repair any leakage, readjust the brake shoe clearances, and add fluid to the master cylinder standpipe to bring to the level originally recorded, if necessary. Start the test again and raise the temperature of the cabinet within 6 2 hours to 120[deg] 5 [deg]C. (248[deg] 9 [deg]F.). During the test observe operation of wheel cylinders for improper functioning and record the amount of fluid required to replenish any loss, at intervals of 24,000 strokes. Stop the test at the end of 85,000 total recorded strokes. These totals shall include the number of strokes during operation at 23[deg] 5 [deg]C. (73.4[deg] 9 [deg]F.) and the number of strokes required to bring the system to the operating temperature. Allow equipment to cool to room temperature. Examine the wheel cylinders for leakage. Stroke the assembly an additional 100 strokes, examine wheel cylinders for leakage and record volume loss of fluid. Within 16 hours after stopping the test, remove the master and wheel cylinders from the system, retaining the fluid in the cylinders by immediately capping or plugging the ports. Disassemble the cylinders, collecting the fluid from the master cylinder and wheel cylinders in a glass jar. When collecting the stroked fluid, remove all residue which has deposited on rubber and metal internal parts by rinsing and agitating such parts in the stroked fluid and using a soft brush to assure that all loose adhering sediment is collected. Clean SBR cups in ethanol (isopropanol when testing DOT 5 fluids) and dry. Inspect the cups for stickiness, scuffing, blistering, cracking, chipping, and change in shape from original appearance. Within 1 hour after disassembly, measure the lip and base diameters of each cylinder cup by the procedures specified in S6.13.4 (a) and (b) with the exception that lip or base diameters of cups may now differ by more than 0.08 mm. (0.003 inch). Determine the hardness of each cup according to S7.4. Note any sludge or gel present in the test fluid. Within 1 hour after draining the cylinders, agitate the fluid in a glass jar to suspend and uniformly disperse sediment and transfer a 100 ml. portion of this fluid to a centrifuge tube and determine percent sediment as described in S7.5. Allow the tube and fluid to stand for 24 hours, recentrifuge and record any additional sediment recovered. Inspect cylinder parts, note any gumming or any pitting on pistons and cylinder walls. Disregard staining or discoloration. Rub any deposits adhering to cylinder walls with a clean soft cloth wetted with ethanol (isopropanol when testing DOT 5 fluids) to determine abrasiveness and removability. Clean cylinder parts in ethanol (isopropanol when testing DOT 5 fluids) and dry. Measure and record diameters of pistons and cylinders according to S6.13.4(a) and (b). Repeat the test if mechanical failure occurs that may affect the evaluation of the brake fluid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Calculate the changes in diameters of cylinders and pistons (see S5.1.13(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Calculate the average decrease in hardness of the seven cups tested, as well as the individual values (see S5.1.13(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Calculate the increases in base diameters of the eight cups (see S5.1.13(e)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Calculate the lip diameter interference set for each of the eight cups by the following formula and average the eight values (see S5.1.13(f)).
[(D1-D2)/(D1-D3)] x 100 = percentage Lip Diameter Interference Setwhere:
D1 = Original lip diameter.D2 = Final lip diameter.D3 = Original cylinder bore diameter.</p><p class="depth0">S6.14 Container information. Each container with information marked directly on the container surface or on a label (labels) affixed to the container pursuant to S5.2.2.2 or S5.2.2.3 is subjected to the following procedure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the container has a label affixed to it, make a single vertical cut all the way through the label with the container in the vertical position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Immerse the container in the same brake fluid or hydraulic system mineral oil contained therein for 15 minutes at room temperature (23 5 [deg]C; 73.4 9 [deg]F).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Within 5 minutes after removing the container from the fluid or oil, remove excess liquid from the surface of the container by wiping with a clean dry cloth.</p><p class="depth0">S7.
