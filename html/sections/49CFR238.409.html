                            <p class="depth0">This section contains requirements for the forward end structure of  the cab of a power car. (A conceptual implementation of this end  structure is provided in Figure 1 to this subpart.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Center collision post. The forward end structure shall have a  full-height center collision post, or its structural equivalent, capable  of withstanding the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A shear load of 500,000 pounds at its joint with the underframe  without exceeding the ultimate strength of the joint;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A shear load of 150,000 pounds at its joint with the roof  without exceeding the ultimate strength of the joint; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A horizontal, longitudinal force of 300,000 pounds, applied at a  point on level with the bottom of the windshield, without exceeding its  ultimate strength.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Side collision posts. The forward end structure shall have two  side collision posts, or their structural equivalent, located at  approximately the one-third points laterally, each capable of  withstanding the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A shear load of 500,000 pounds at its joint with the underframe  without exceeding the ultimate strength of the joint; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A horizontal, longitudinal force of 300,000 pounds, applied at a  point on level with the bottom of the windshield, without exceeding its  ultimate strength.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Corner posts. The forward end structure shall have two full- height corner posts, or their structural equivalent, each capable of  withstanding the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A horizontal, longitudinal or lateral shear load of 300,000  pounds at its joint with the underframe, without exceeding the ultimate  strength of the joint;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A horizontal, lateral force of 100,000 pounds applied at a point  30 inches up from the underframe attachment, without exceeding the yield  or the critical buckling stress; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A horizontal, longitudinal or lateral shear load of 80,000  pounds at its joint with the roof, without exceeding the ultimate  strength of the joint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Skin. The skin covering the forward-facing end of each power car  shall be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Equivalent to a \1/2\-inch steel plate with a 25,000 pounds-per- square-inch yield strength--material of a higher yield strength may be  used to decrease the required thickness of the material provided at  least an equivalent level of strength is maintained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Securely attached to the end structure; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sealed to prevent the entry of fluids into the occupied cab area  of the equipment. As used in paragraph (d), the term ``skin'' does not  include forward-facing windows and doors.</p>
