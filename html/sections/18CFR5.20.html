An  applicant having a deficient application will be afforded additional  time to correct the deficiencies, not to exceed 90 days from the date of  notification. Notification will be by letter or, in the case of minor  deficiencies, by telephone. Any   notification will specify the deficiencies to be corrected. Deficiencies  must be corrected by submitting an a filing pursuant to the requirements  of subpart T of part 385 of this chapter within the time specified in  the notification of deficiency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Patently deficient applications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, within 30 days of its  filing date, the Director of the Office of Energy Projects determines  that an application patently fails to substantially comply with the  prefiling consultation and filing requirements of this part, or is for a  project that is precluded by law, the application will be rejected as  patently deficient with the specification of the deficiencies that  render the application patently deficient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If, after 30 days following its filing date, the Director of the  Office of Energy Projects determines that an application patently fails  to comply with the prefiling consultation and filing requirements of  this part, or is for a project that is precluded by law:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The application will be rejected by order of the Commission, if  the Commission determines that it is patently deficient; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The application will be considered deficient under paragraph  (a)(2) of this Section, if the Commission determines that it is not  patently deficient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any application for an original license that is rejected may be  submitted if the deficiencies are corrected and if, in the case of a  competing application, the resubmittal is timely. The date the rejected  application is resubmitted will be considered the new filing date for  purposes of determining its timeliness under Sec. 4.36 of this chapter  and the disposition of competing applications under Sec. 4.37 of this  chapter.
