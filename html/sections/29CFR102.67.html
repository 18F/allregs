                            <p class="depth0">Notice of Election; voter list.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Proceedings before regional director. The regional director may proceed, either forthwith upon the record or after oral argument, the submission of briefs, or further hearing, as the director may deem proper, to determine whether a question of representation exists in a unit appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining, and to direct an election, dismiss the petition, or make other disposition of the matter. A decision by the regional director upon the record shall set forth the director's findings, conclusions, and order or direction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Directions of elections. If the regional director directs an election, the direction ordinarily will specify the type, date(s), time(s), and location(s) of the election and the eligibility period. The regional director shall schedule the election for the earliest date practicable consistent with these rules. The regional director shall transmit the direction of election to the parties and their designated representatives by email, facsimile, or by overnight mail (if neither an email address nor facsimile number was provided). The regional director shall also transmit the Board's Notice of Election to the parties and their designated representatives by email, facsimile, or by overnight mail (if neither an email address nor facsimile number was provided),

and it will ordinarily be transmitted simultaneously with the direction of election. If the direction of election provides for individuals to vote subject to challenge because their eligibility has not been determined, the Notice of Election shall so state, and shall advise employees that the individuals are neither included in, nor excluded from, the bargaining unit, inasmuch as the regional director has permitted them to vote subject to challenge. The election notice shall further advise employees that the eligibility or inclusion of the individuals will be resolved, if necessary, following the election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests for Board review of regional director actions. Upon the filing of a request therefor with the Board by any interested person, the Board may review any action of a regional director delegated to him under Section 3(b) of the Act except as the Board's rules provide otherwise, but such a review shall not, unless specifically ordered by the Board, operate as a stay of any action by the regional director. The request for review may be filed at any time following the action until 14 days after a final disposition of the proceeding by the regional director. No party shall be precluded from filing a request for review of the direction of election within the time provided in this paragraph because it did not file a request for review of the direction of election prior to the election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Grounds for review. The Board will grant a request for review only where compelling reasons exist therefor. Accordingly, a request for review may be granted only upon one or more of the following grounds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That a substantial question of law or policy is raised because of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The absence of; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A departure from, officially reported Board precedent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the regional director's decision on a substantial factual issue is clearly erroneous on the record and such error prejudicially affects the rights of a party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the conduct of any hearing or any ruling made in connection with the proceeding has resulted in prejudicial error.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That there are compelling reasons for reconsideration of an important Board rule or policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Contents of request. A request for review must be a self-contained document enabling the Board to rule on the basis of its contents without the necessity of recourse to the record; however, the Board may, in its discretion, examine the record in evaluating the request. With respect to the ground listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and other grounds where appropriate, the request must contain a summary of all evidence or rulings bearing on the issues together with page citations from the transcript and a summary of argument. Such request may not raise any issue or allege any facts not timely presented to the regional director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Opposition to request. Any party may, within 7 days after the last day on which the request for review must be filed, file with the Board a statement in opposition which shall be served in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section. The Board may grant or deny the request for review without awaiting a statement in opposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Finality; waiver; denial of request. The regional director's actions are final unless a request for review is granted. The parties may, at any time, waive their right to request review. Failure to request review shall preclude such parties from relitigating, in any related subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding, any issue which was, or could have been, raised in the representation proceeding. Denial of a request for review shall constitute an affirmance of the regional director's action which shall also preclude relitigating any such issues in any related subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Grant of review; briefs. The grant of a request for review shall not stay the regional director's action unless otherwise ordered by the Board. Except where the Board rules upon the issues on review in the order granting review, the appellants and other parties may, within 14 days after issuance of an order granting review, file briefs with the Board. Such briefs may be reproductions of those previously filed with the regional director and/or other

briefs which shall be limited to the issues raised in the request for review. Where review has been granted, the Board may provide for oral argument or further hearing. The Board will consider the entire record in the light of the grounds relied on for review and shall make such disposition of the matter as it deems appropriate. Any request for review may be withdrawn with the permission of the Board at any time prior to the issuance of the decision of the Board thereon.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)(1)</em> Format of request. All documents filed with the Board under the provisions of this section shall be filed in seven copies, double spaced, on 8\1/2\- by 11-inch paper, and shall be printed or otherwise legibly duplicated. Extra copies of electronically-filed papers need not be filed. Requests for review, including briefs in support thereof and any motions under paragraph (j) of this section; statements in opposition thereto; and briefs on review shall not exceed 50 pages in length, exclusive of subject index and table of cases and other authorities cited, unless permission to exceed that limit is obtained from the Board by motion, setting forth the reasons therefor, filed not less than 5 days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, prior to the date the document is due. Where any brief filed pursuant to this section exceeds 20 pages, it shall contain a subject index with page authorities cited. A party may combine a request for review of the regional director's decision and direction of election with a request for review of a regional director's post-election decision, if the party has not previously filed a request for review of the pre-election decision. Repetitive requests will not be considered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Format of request. All documents filed with the Board under the provisions of this section shall be filed in seven copies, double spaced, on 8\1/2\- by 11-inch paper, and shall be printed or otherwise legibly duplicated.

Repetitive requests will not be considered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Service. The party filing with the Board a request for review, a statement in opposition to a request for review, or a brief on review shall serve a copy thereof on the other parties and shall file a copy with the regional director. A certificate of service shall be filed with the Board together with the document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Extensions. Requests for extensions of time to file requests for review, statements in opposition to a request for review, or briefs, as permitted by this section, shall be filed with the Board or the regional director, as the case may be. The party filing the request for an extension of time shall serve a copy thereof on the other parties and, if filed with the Board, on the regional director. A statement of such service shall be filed with the document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Requests for extraordinary relief. (1) A party requesting review may also move in writing to the Board for one or more of the following forms of relief:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A party requesting review may also move in writing to the Board for one or more of the following forms of relief:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Expedited consideration of the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A stay of some or all of the proceedings, including the election; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Impoundment and/or segregation of some or all of the ballots.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Relief will be granted only upon a clear showing that it is necessary under the particular circumstances of the case. The pendency of a motion does not entitle a party to interim relief, and an affirmative ruling by the Board granting relief is required before the action of the regional director will be altered in any fashion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Notice of election. The employer shall post copies of the Board's Notice of Election in conspicuous places, including all places where notices to employees in the unit are customarily posted, at least 3 full working days prior to 12:01 a.m. of the day of the election and shall also distribute it electronically if the employer customarily communicates with employees in the unit electronically. In elections involving mail ballots, the election shall be deemed to have commenced the day the ballots are deposited by the regional office in the mail. In all cases, the notices shall remain posted until the end of the election. The term working day shall mean an entire 24-hour period excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. The employer's failure properly to post or distribute the election notices as required herein shall be grounds for setting aside the election whenever proper and timely objections are filed under the provisions of Sec. 102.69(a). A party shall be estopped from objecting to the nonposting of notices if it is responsible for the nonposting, and likewise shall be estopped from objecting to the nondistribution of notices if it is responsible for the nondistribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Voter list. Absent extraordinary circumstances specified in the direction of election, the employer shall, within 2 business days after issuance of the direction, provide to the regional director and the parties named in such direction a list of the full names, work locations, shifts, job classifications, and contact information (including home addresses, available personal email addresses, and available home and personal cellular (``cell'') telephone numbers) of all eligible voters. The employer shall also include in a separate section of that list the same information for those individuals who, according to the direction of election, will be permitted to vote subject to challenge, including, for example, individuals in the classifications or other groupings that will be permitted to vote subject to challenge. In order to be timely filed and served, the list must be received by the regional director and the parties named in the direction respectively within 2 business days after issuance of the direction of election unless a longer time is specified therein. The list of names shall be alphabetized (overall or by department) and be in an electronic format approved by the General Counsel unless the employer certifies that it does not possess the capacity to produce the list in the required form. When feasible, the list shall be filed electronically with the regional director and served electronically on the other parties named in the direction. A certificate of service on all parties shall be filed with the regional director when the voter list is filed. The employer's failure to file or serve the list within the specified time or in proper format shall be grounds for setting aside the election whenever proper and timely objections are filed under the provisions of Sec. 102.69(a). The employer shall be estopped from objecting to the failure to file or serve the list within the specified time or in the proper format if it is responsible for the failure. The parties shall not use the list for purposes other than the representation proceeding, Board proceedings arising from it, and related matters.
