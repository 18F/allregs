                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Every manufacturer importing or manufacturing from raw coca  leaves shall submit information accounting for the importation and for  all manufacturing operations performed between the importation and the  manufacture of bulk or finished products standardized in accordance with  U.S. Pharmacopoeia, National Formulary, or other recognized standards.  The reports shall be submitted quarterly on company letterhead to the  Drug and Chemical Evaluation Section, Drug Enforcement Administration,  on or before the 15th day of the month immediately following the period  for which it is submitted. See the Table of DEA Mailing Addresses in  Sec. 1321.01 of this chapter for the current mailing address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following information shall be submitted for raw coca leaf,  ecgonine, ecgonine for conversion or further manufacture,  benzoylecgonine, manufacturing coca extracts (list for tinctures and  extracts; and others separately), other crude alkaloids and other  derivatives (quantities should be reported as grams of actual quantity  involved and the cocaine alkaloid content or equivalency):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Beginning inventory;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Imports;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gains on reweighing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Quantity purchased;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Quantity produced;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other receipts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Quantity returned to processes for reworking;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Material used in purification for sale;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Material used for manufacture or production;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Losses on reweighing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Material used for conversion;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Other dispositions and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Ending inventory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following information shall be submitted for importation of  coca leaves:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Import permit number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Date the shipment arrived at the United States port of entry;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Actual quantity shipped;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Assay (percent) of cocaine alkaloid and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Total cocaine alkaloid content.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon importation of coca leaves, samples will be selected and  assays made by the importing manufacturer in accordance with recognized  chemical procedures. These assays shall form the basis of accounting for  such coca leaves, which shall be accounted for in terms of their cocaine  alkaloid content or equivalency or their total anhydrous coca alkaloid  content. Where final assay data is not determined at the time of  submission, the   report shall be made on the basis of the best data available, subject to  adjustment, and the necessary adjusting entries shall be made on the  next report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where factory procedure is such that partial withdrawals of  medicinal coca leaves are made from individual containers, there shall  be attached to the container a stock record card on which shall be kept  a complete record of withdrawals therefrom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All in-process inventories should be expressed in terms of end- products and not precursors. Once precursor material has been changed or  placed into process for the manufacture of a specified end-product, it  must no longer be accounted for as precursor stocks available for  conversion or use, but rather as end-product in-process inventories.
