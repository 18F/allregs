FSA will analyze and determine whether a participant's evidence of actual production represents all that could or would have been harvested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For all crops eligible for loan deficiency payments or marketing assistance loans with an intended use of

grain but harvested as silage, ensilage, cobbage, hay, cracked, rolled, or crimped, production will be adjusted based on a whole grain equivalent as established by FSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For crops with an established yield and market price for multiple intended uses, a value will be calculated by FSA with respect to the intended use or uses for disaster purposes based on historical production and acreage evidence provided by the participant and FSA will determine the eligible acres for each use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For crops sold in a market that is not a recognized market for the crop with no established county average yield and average market price, 42 percent of the salvage value received will be deducted from the disaster payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If a participant does not receive compensation based upon the quantity of the commodity delivered to a purchaser, but has an agreement or contract for guaranteed payment for production, the determination of the production will be the greater of the actual production or the guaranteed payment converted to production as determined by FSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Production that is commingled between units before it was a matter of record or combination of record and cannot be separated by using records or other means acceptable to FSA will be prorated to each respective unit by FSA.
