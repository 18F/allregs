                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> All terms used in this subpart that are not defined below have the meaning given to them in the Act and in subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Base film means the substrate that is coated to produce magnetic tape.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Capture system means any device or combination of devices that contains or collects an airborne pollutant and directs it into a duct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coating applicator means any apparatus used to apply a coating to a continuous base film.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Coating mix preparation equipment means all mills, mixers, holding tanks, polishing tanks, and other equipment used in the preparation of the magnetic coating formulation but does not include those mills that do not emit VOC because they are closed, sealed, and operated under pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Coating operation means any coating applicator, flashoff area, and drying oven located between a base film unwind station and a base film rewind station that coat a continuous base film to produce magnetic tape.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Common emission control device means a control device controlling emissions from the coating operation as well as from another emission source within the plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Concurrent means construction of a control device is commenced or completed within the period beginning 6 months prior to the date construction of affected coating mix preparation equipment commences and ending 2 years after the date construction of affected coating mix preparation equipment is completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Control device means any apparatus that reduces the quantity of a pollutant emitted to the air.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Cover means, with respect to coating mix preparation equipment, a device that lies over the equipment opening to prevent VOC from escaping and that meets the requirements found in Sec. 60.712(c)(1)-(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Drying oven means a chamber in which heat is used to bake, cure, polymerize, or dry a surface coating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Equivalent diameter means four times the area of an opening divided by its perimeter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Flashoff area means the portion of a coating operation between the coating applicator and the drying oven where solvent begins to evaporate from the coated base film.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Magnetic tape means any flexible substrate that is covered on one or both sides with a coating containing magnetic particles and that is used for audio or video recording or information storage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Natural draft opening means any opening in a room, building, or total enclosure that remains open during operation of the facility and that is not connected to a duct in which a fan is installed. The rate and direction of the natural draft across such an opening is a consequence of the difference in pressures on either side of the wall containing the opening.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Nominal 1-month period means a calendar month or, if established prior to the performance test in a statement submitted with notification of anticipated startup pursuant to 40 CFR

60.7(a)(2), a similar monthly time period (e.g., 30-day month or accounting month).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Temporary enclosure means a total enclosure that is constructed for the sole purpose of measuring the fugitive emissions from an affected facility. A temporary enclosure must be constructed and ventilated (through stacks suitable for testing) so that it has minimal impact on the performance of the permanent capture system. A temporary enclosure will be assumed to achieve total capture of fugitive VOC emissions if it conforms to the requirements found in Sec. 60.713(b)(5)(i) and if all natural draft openings are at least four duct or hood equivalent diameters away from each exhaust duct or hood. Alternatively, the owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for approval of a temporary enclosure on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Total enclosure means a structure that is constructed around a source of emissions so that all VOC emissions are collected and exhausted through a stack or duct. With a total enclosure, there will be no fugitive emissions, only stack emissions. The only openings in a total enclosure are forced makeup air and exhaust ducts and any natural draft openings such as those that allow raw materials to enter and exit the enclosure for processing. All access doors or windows are closed during routine operation of the enclosed source. Brief, occasional openings of such doors or windows to accommodate process equipment adjustments are acceptable, but, if such openings are routine or if an access door remains open during the entire operation, the access door must be considered a natural draft opening. The average inward face velocity across the natural draft openings of the enclosure must be calculated including the area of such access doors. The drying oven itself may be part of the total enclosure. A permanent enclosure that meets the requirements found in Sec. 60.713(b)(5)(i) is assumed to be a total enclosure. The owner or operator of a permanent enclosure that does not meet the requirements may apply to the Administrator for approval of the enclosure as a total enclosure on a case-by-case basis. Such approval shall be granted upon a demonstration to the satisfaction of the Administrator that all VOC emissions are contained and vented to the control device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Utilize refers to the use of solvent that is delivered to coating mix preparation equipment for the purpose of formulating coatings to be applied on an affected coating operation and any other solvent (e.g., dilution solvent) that is added at any point in the manufacturing process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> VOC content of the coating applied means the product of Method 24 VOC analyses or formulation data (if the data are demonstrated to be equivalent to Method 24 results) and the total volume of coating fed to the coating applicator. This quantity is intended to include all VOC that actually are emitted from the coating operation in the gaseous phase. Thus, for purposes of the liquid-liquid VOC material balance in Sec. 60.713(b)(1), any VOC (including dilution solvent) added to the coatings must be accounted for, and any VOC contained in waste coatings or retained in the final product may be measured and subtracted from the total. (These adjustments are not necessary for the gaseous emission test compliance provisions of Sec. 60.713(b).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> Volatile Organic Compounds or VOC means any organic compounds that participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions or that are measured by Method 18, 24, 25, or 25A or an equivalent or alternative method as defined in 40 CFR 60.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The nomenclature used in this subpart has the following meaning:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ak = the area of each natural draft opening (k) in a total enclosure, in square meters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Caj = the concentration of VOC in each gas stream (j) exiting the emission control device, in parts per million by volume.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cbi = the concentration of VOC in each gas stream (i) entering the emission control device, in parts per million by volume.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Cdi = the concentration of VOC in each gas stream (i) entering the emission control device from the affected coating operation, in parts per million by volume.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Cfk = the concentration of VOC in each uncontrolled gas stream (k) emitted directly to the atmosphere from the affected coating operation, in parts per million by volume.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Cgv = the concentration of VOC in the gas stream entering each individual carbon adsorber vessel (v), in parts per million by volume.
