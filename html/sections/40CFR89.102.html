                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart applies to all engines described in Sec. 89.101 with the following power rating and manufactured after the following dates:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Less than 19 kW and manufactured on or after January 1, 2000;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Greater than or equal to 19 kW but less than 37 kW and manufactured on or after January 1, 1999;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Greater than or equal to 37 kW but less than 75 kW and manufactured on or after January 1, 1998;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Greater than or equal to 75 kW but less than 130 kW and manufactured on or after January 1, 1997;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Greater than or equal to 130 kW but less than or equal to 560 kW and manufactured on or after January 1, 1996;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Greater than 560 kW and manufactured on or after January 1, 2000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A manufacturer can optionally certify engines manufactured up to one calendar year prior to the effective date of mandatory certification to earn emission credits under the averaging, banking, and trading program. Such optionally certified engines are subject to all provisions relating to mandatory certification and enforcement described in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Engines meeting the voluntary standards described in Sec. 89.112(f) may be

designated as Blue Sky Series engines through the 2004 model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Implementation flexibility for equipment and vehicle manufacturers and post-manufacture marinizers. Nonroad equipment and vehicle manufacturers and post-manufacture marinizers may take any of the otherwise prohibited actions identified in Sec. 89.1003(a)(1) and (b)(4) with respect to nonroad equipment and vehicles and marine diesel engines, subject to the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. The following allowances apply separately to each engine power category subject to standards under Sec. 89.112:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Percent-of-production allowances -- (i) Equipment rated at or above 37 kW. For nonroad equipment and vehicles with engines rated at or above 37 kW, a manufacturer may take any of the actions identified in Sec. 89.1003(a)(1) for a portion of its U.S.-directed production volume of such equipment and vehicles during the seven years immediately following the date on which Tier 2 engine standards first apply to engines used in such equipment and vehicles, provided that the seven-year sum of these portions in each year, as expressed as a percentage for each year, does not exceed 80, and provided that all such equipment and vehicles or equipment contain Tier 1 or Tier 2 engines;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Equipment rated at or above 37 kW. For nonroad equipment and vehicles with engines rated at or above 37 kW, a manufacturer may take any of the actions identified in Sec. 89.1003(a)(1) for a portion of its U.S.-directed production volume of such equipment and vehicles during the seven years immediately following the date on which Tier 2 engine standards first apply to engines used in such equipment and vehicles, provided that the seven-year sum of these portions in each year, as expressed as a percentage for each year, does not exceed 80, and provided that all such equipment and vehicles or equipment contain Tier 1 or Tier 2 engines;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Equipment rated under 37 kW. For nonroad equipment and vehicles and marine diesel engines with engines rated under 37 kW, a manufacturer may take any of the actions identified in Sec. 89.1003(a)(1) for a portion of its U.S.-directed production volume of such equipment and vehicles during the seven years immediately following the date on which Tier 1 engine standards first apply to engines used in such equipment and vehicles, provided that the seven-year sum of these portions in each year, as expressed as a percentage for each year, does not exceed 80.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Small volume allowances. A nonroad equipment or vehicle manufacturer or post-manufacture marinizer may exceed the production percentages in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, provided that in each regulated power category the manufacturer's total of excepted nonroad equipment and vehicles and marine diesel engines:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Over the years in which the percent-of-production allowance applies does not exceed 100 units times the number of years in which the percent-of-production allowance applies; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Does not exceed 200 units in any year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Does not use engines from more than one engine family, or, for excepted equipment vehicles, and marine diesel engines using engines not belonging to any engine family, from more than one engine manufacturer. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii), engine family refers to engines that have common characteristics as described in Sec. 89.116.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inclusion of previous-tier engines. Nonroad equipment and vehicles and marine diesel engines built with previous tier or noncertified engines under the existing inventory provisions of Sec. 89.1003(b)(4) need not be included in determining compliance with paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recordkeeping and calculation to verify compliance. The following shall apply to nonroad equipment or vehicle manufacturers and post-manufacture marinizers who produce excepted equipment or vehicles or marine diesel engines under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each power category in which excepted nonroad equipment or vehicles or marine diesel engines are produced, a calculation to verify compliance with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section shall be made by the nonroad equipment or vehicle manufacturer or post-manufacture marinizer. This calculation shall be made no later than December 31 of the year following the last year in which allowances are used, and shall be based on actual production information from the subject years. If both the percent-of-production and small volume allowances have been exceeded, then the manufacturer is in violation of section 203 of the Act and Sec. 89.1003, except as provided under paragraphs (f) and (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A nonroad equipment or vehicle manufacturer or post-manufacture marinizer shall keep records of all nonroad equipment and vehicles and marine diesel engines excepted under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this

section, for each power category in which exceptions are taken. These records shall include equipment and engine model numbers, serial numbers, and dates of manufacture, and engine rated power. In addition, the manufacturer shall keep records sufficient to demonstrate the verifications of compliance required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. All records shall be kept until at least two full years after the final year in which allowances are available for each power category, and shall be made available to EPA upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Hardship relief. Nonroad equipment and vehicle manufacturers and post-manufacture marinizers may take any of the otherwise prohibited actions identified in Sec. 89.1003(a)(1) if approved by the Administrator, and subject to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application for relief must be submitted to the Engine Programs and Compliance Division of the EPA in writing prior to the earliest date in which the applying manufacturer would be in violation of Sec. 89.1003. The manufacturer must submit evidence showing that the requirements for approval have been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applying manufacturer must not be the manufacturer of the engines used in the equipment for which relief is sought. This requirement does not apply to post-manufacture marinizers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The conditions causing the impending violation must not be substantially the fault of the applying manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The conditions causing the impending violation must be such that the applying manufacturer will experience serious economic hardship if relief is not granted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The applying manufacturer must demonstrate that no allowances under paragraph (d) of this section will be available to avoid the impending violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any relief granted must begin within one year after the implementation date of the standard applying to the engines being used in the equipment, or to the marine diesel engines, for which relief is requested, and may not exceed one year in duration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The Administrator may impose other conditions on the granting of relief including provisions to recover the lost environmental benefit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Allowance for the production of engines. Engine manufacturers may take any of the otherwise prohibited actions identified in Sec. 89.1003(a)(1) with regard to uncertified engines, Tier 1 engines, or Tier 2 engines, as appropriate, if the engine manufacturer has received written assurance from the equipment manufacturer that the engine is required to meet the demand for engines created under paragraph (d), (f), or (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Alternative Flexibility for Post-Manufacture Marinizers. Post-manufacture marinizers may elect to delay the effective date of the Tier 1 standards in Sec. 89.112 for marine diesel engines rated under 37 kW by one year, instead of using the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section. Post-manufacture marinizers wishing to take advantage of this provision must inform the Director of the Engine Programs and Compliance Division of their intent to do so in writing before the date that the standards would otherwise take effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Additional exemptions for technical or engineering hardship. You may request additional engine allowances under paragraph (d)(1) of this section for 56-560 kW power categories or, if you are a small equipment manufacturer, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for engines at or above 37 and below 75 kW. However, you may use these extra allowances only for those equipment models for which you, or an affiliated company, do not also produce the engine. After considering the circumstances, we may permit you to introduce into U.S. commerce equipment with such engines that do not comply with Tier 3 emission standards, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We may approve additional exemptions if extreme and unusual circumstances that are clearly outside your control and that could not have been avoided with reasonable discretion have resulted in technical or engineering problems that prevent you from meeting the requirements of this part. You must show that you exercised prudent planning and have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the

scope of your request for additional allowances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To apply for exemptions under this paragraph (i), send the Designated Compliance Officer and the Designated Enforcement Officer a written request as soon as possible before you are in violation. In your request, include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Describe your process for designing equipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Describe how you normally work cooperatively or concurrently with your engine supplier to design products.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Describe the engineering or technical problems causing you to request the exemption and explain why you have not been able to solve them. Describe the extreme and unusual circumstances that led to these problems and explain how they were unavoidable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Describe any information or products you received from your engine supplier related to equipment design--such as written specifications, performance data, or prototype engines--and when you received it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Compare the design processes of the equipment model for which you need additional exemptions and that for other models for which you do not need additional exemptions. Explain the technical differences that justify your request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Describe your efforts to find and use other compliant engines, or otherwise explain why none is available.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Describe the steps you have taken to minimize the scope of your request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Include other relevant information. You must give us other relevant information if we ask for it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Estimate the increased percent of production you need for each equipment model covered by your request, as described in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. Estimate the increased number of allowances you need for each equipment model covered by your request, as described in paragraph (i)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We may approve your request to increase the allowances under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, subject to the following limitations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The additional allowances will not exceed 50 percent for each power category.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must use up the allowances under paragraph (d)(1) of this section before using any additional allowance under this paragraph (i).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any allowances we approve under this paragraph (i)(3) expire 24 months after the provisions of this section start for a given power category. You may use these allowances only for the specific equipment models covered by your request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> We may approve your request to increase the allowances for the 37-75 kW power category under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, subject to the following limitations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You are eligible for additional allowances under this paragraph (i)(4) only if you are a small equipment manufacturer and you do not use the provisions of paragraph (i)(3) of this section to obtain additional allowances for the 37-75 kW power category.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must use up all the available allowances for the 37-75 kW power category under paragraph (d)(2) of this section in a given year before using any additional allowances under this paragraph (i)(4).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Base your request only on equipment you produce with engines at or above 37 kW and below 75 kW. You may use any additional allowances only for equipment you produce with engines at or above 37 kW and below 75 kW.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any allowances we approve under this paragraph (i)(4) expire 24 months after the provisions of this section start for this power category. These additional allowances are not subject to the annual limits specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. You may use these allowances only for the specific equipment models covered by your request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The total allowances under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the 37-75 kW power category will not exceed 700 units. The total allowances under this paragraph (i)(4) follow the requirements under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the 37-75 kW power category and will not exceed 200 units. Therefore, the total maximum allowances for the 37-75 kW power category will not exceed 900 units.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (i), small equipment manufacturer means an equipment manufacturer that had annual U.S.-directed production volume of equipment using nonroad diesel engines between 37 and 75 kW of no more than 3,000 units in 2002 and all earlier calendar years, and has 750 or fewer employees (500 or fewer employees for nonroad equipment manufacturers that produce no construction equipment or industrial trucks). For manufacturers owned by a parent company, the production limit applies to the production of the parent company and all its subsidiaries and the employee limit applies to the total number of employees of the parent company and all its subsidiaries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The following provisions for adjusted flexibilities for Tier 4 engines apply to equipment manufacturers that are granted additional exemptions for technical or engineering hardship:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you use the additional allowance under this paragraph (i) you shall forfeit percent of production flexibility plus technical or engineering hardship exemptions available for Tier 4 engines in the amounts shown in Table 1 of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Table 1 of this section shows the percent of production flexibility and technical or engineering hardship exemptions that you must forfeit for Tier 4 engines. The amount of Tier 4 flexibility forfeited by each equipment manufacturer depends on the percent of production flexibility used for Tier 2 engines and the technical or engineering hardship exemptions granted for Tier 3 engines in the proportions shown in Table 1. For example, if you used 45 percent of your production flexibility for Tier 2 engines, you must forfeit 2 percent of your production flexibility for Tier 4 engines for every 1 percent of technical or engineering hardship flexibility granted for Tier 3 engines. In addition you must also forfeit 1 percent of any technical or engineering hardship exemptions available for Tier 4 engines for every 1 percent technical or engineering hardship exemptions available for Tier 3 engines. If you use the Tier 3 technical or engineering hardship allowances for 5 percent of your equipment in each of two different years, you have used a total allowance of 10 percent. Therefore you must forfeit a total of 20 percent of production flexibility for Tier 4 engines plus 10 percent of any technical or engineering hardship exemptions available for Tier 4 engines.</p><p class="depth4">Table 1 of Sec.  89.102--Adjustments to Tier 4 Flexibilities------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Percent of   Percent of</p><p class="depth4">forfeit      forfeit</p><p class="depth4">Percent of use Tier 2 production flexibility      Tier 4       Tier 4</p><p class="depth4">production   tech./eng.</p><p class="depth4">flexibility   exemption------------------------------------------------------------------------Greater than 0% and up to 20%.................            0            1Greater than 20% and up to 40%................            1            1Greater than 40% and up to 60%................            2            1Greater than 60% and up to 80%................            3            1------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Because the Tier 3 and Tier 4 rules have different power category ranges, the availability of technical relief will be further adjusted based on the sales volume by power category. Table 2 of this section shows the applicable power categories for Tier 3 and Tier 4. The Tier 3 power categories of 37kW to 75kW and 75kW to 130kW correspond to the Tier 4 power category of 56kW to 130kW. For the Tier 3 equipment in the 37 to 75kW category, you must only use the sales volume for equipment that uses engines with a rated power greater than 56kW. For example, if you have a Tier 3 piece of equipment that uses a 40 kW engine, the sales of the equipment are counted in the Tier 4 power category of 19kW to 56kW. If you have a Tier 3 piece of equipment that uses a 60kW engine, the sales of the equipment are counted in the Tier 4 power category of 56kW to 130kW. The Tier 3 power categories of 130kW to 225kW, 225kW to 450kW and 450kW to 560kW correspond to the Tier 4 power category of 130kW to 560kW. You will need to sum the sales of the Tier 3 power categories that correspond to the Tier 4 power category during each calendar year in which Tier 3 technical relief is used. The sum of all the Tier 3 units that are produced and exempted by the technical relief divided by the sum of all the Tier 3 units sold in the corresponding Tier 4 power category will determine the percentage of Tier 4 flexibility affected. For example, if you produce 50 units using Tier 3 technical relief in the range of 130kW

to 225kW, and you produce 50 units using Tier 3 technical relief in the range of 225 to 450kW, and no units are produced in the 450kW to 560kW range, and your overall sales volume for the power ranges of 130kW to 560kW in Tier 3 is 400 units, the amount of Tier 3 technical relief used is 100/400 or 25 percent. Because you forfeit 1 percent of your Tier 4 technical relief for every 1 percent of Tier 3 technical relief used, then you will lose 25 percent of your Tier 4 technical relief in the 130kW to 560kW power range category. If you used 45 percent of your production flexibility for Tier 2 engines, you must forfeit 2 percent of production flexibility for Tier 4 engines for every 1 percent of Tier 3 technical relief. Therefore, you will forfeit 50 percent of your Tier 4 production allowance in the 130kW to 560kW power range category.</p><p class="depth4">Table 2 of Sec.  89.102--Corresponding Tier 3 and Tier 4 Power</p><p class="depth4">Categories------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Tier 3 power categories              Tier 4 power categories------------------------------------------------------------------------37<=kW<75 \*\.............................  19<=kW<5637<=kW<75 \**\, 75<=kW<130................  56<=kW<130130<=kW<225, 225<=kW<450, 450<=kW<560.....  130<=kW<=560------------------------------------------------------------------------\*\ Applies only to use of engines rated between 37kW and 56kW by small</p><p class="depth4">volume equipment manufacturers.\**\ Includes only equipment that uses engines with a rated power</p><p class="depth4">greater than 56kw.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Manufacturers using allowances under this paragraph (i) must comply with the notification and reporting requirements specified in paragraph (i)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Notification and reporting. You must notify us of your intent to use the technical relief provisions of this paragraph (i) and send us an annual report to verify that you are not exceeding the allowances, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before the first year you intend to use the provisions of this section, send the Designated Compliance Officer and the Designated Enforcement Officer a written notice of your intent, including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Your company's name and address, and your parent company's name and address, if applicable.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Whom to contact for more information.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The calendar years in which you expect to use the exemption provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The name and address of the company that produces the engines you will be using for the equipment exempted under this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Your best estimate of the number of units in each power category you will produce under this section and whether you intend to comply under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The number of units in each power category you have sold in previous calendar years under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each year that you use the provisions of this section, send the Designated Compliance Officer and the Designated Enforcement Officer a written report by March 31 of the following year. Include in your report the total number of engines you sold in the preceding year for each power category, based on actual U.S.-directed production information. Also identify the percentages of U.S.-directed production that correspond to the number of units in each power category and the cumulative numbers and percentages of units for all the units you have sold under this section for each power category. You may omit the percentage figures if you include in the report a statement that you will not be using the percent-of-production allowances in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Recordkeeping. Keep the following records of all equipment with exempted engines you produce under this paragraph (i) for at least five full years after the final year in which allowances are available for each power category:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The model number, serial number, and the date of manufacture for each engine and piece of equipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum power of each engine.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The total number or percentage of equipment with exempted engines, as described in paragraph (d) of this section and all documentation supporting your calculation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The notifications and reports we require under paragraph (i)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Equipment Labeling. Any engine produced under this paragraph (i) must meet the labeling requirements of 40 CFR 89.110, but add the following statement instead of the compliance statement in 40 CFR 89.110 (b)(10): THIS ENGINE MEETS U.S. EPA EMISSION STANDARDS UNDER 40 CFR 89.102. SELLING OR INSTALLING THIS ENGINE FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN FOR THE EQUIPMENT FLEXIBILITY PROVISIONS OF 40 CFR 89.102 MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Enforcement. Producing more exempted engines or equipment than we allow under this paragraph (i) or installing engines that do not meet the applicable Tier 1 emission standards described in Sec. 89.112 violates the prohibitions in Sec. 89.1003(a)(1). You must give us the records we require under this paragraph (i) if we ask for them (see Sec. 89.1003(a)(2)).
