                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. 12 U.S.C. 93a, 1818.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. This section requires a national bank to obtain the  approval of the OCC before changing the composition of all, or  substantially all, of its assets through sales or other dispositions,  or, having sold or disposed of all, or substantially all, of its assets,  through subsequent purchases or other acquisitions or other expansions  of its operations. This section does not apply to a change in  composition of all, or substantially all, of a bank's assets that the  bank undertakes in response to direction from the OCC (e.g., in an  enforcement action pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818) or as part of a voluntary  liquidation pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 181 and 182 and 12 CFR 5.48, if the  liquidating bank has stipulated in its notice of liquidation to the OCC  that its liquidation will be completed, the bank dissolved and its  charter returned to the OCC within one year of the date it filed this  notice, unless the OCC extends the time period. This section does not  apply to changes in asset composition that occur as a result of a bank's  ordinary and ongoing business of originating and securitizing loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Approval requirement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A national bank must file an  application   and obtain the prior written approval of the OCC before changing the  composition of all, or substantially all, of its assets (i) through  sales or other dispositions, or, (ii) having sold or disposed of all or  substantially all of its assets, through subsequent purchases or other  acquisitions or other expansions of its operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining whether to approve an application under paragraph  (c)(1) of this section, the OCC will consider the purpose of the  transaction, its impact on the safety and soundness of the bank, and any  effect on the bank's customers. The OCC may deny the application if the  transaction would have a negative effect in any of these respects. The  OCC's review of any change in asset composition through purchase or  other acquisition or other expansions of its operations under paragraph  (c)(1)(ii) of this section will include, in addition to the foregoing  factors, the factors governing the organization of a bank under  Sec. 5.20.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions to Rules of General Applicability. Sections 5.8,  5.10, and 5.11 do not apply with respect to applications filed pursuant  to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application  presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the  OCC may determine that some or all of the provisions of Secs. 5.8, 5.10,  and 5.11 apply.
