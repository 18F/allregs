                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The safety signal indicates that the station is about to transmit a message concerning the safety of navigation or giving important meteorological warnings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In radiotelegraphy, the safety signal consists of three repetitions of the group TTT, sent with the individual

letters of each group, and the successive groups clearly separated from each other. It must be sent before the call.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In radiotelephony, the safety signal consists of the word SECURITE, pronounced as in French, spoken three times and transmitted before the call.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The safety signal and call must be sent on one of the international distress frequencies (2182 kHz or 156.8 MHz radiotelephone). Stations which cannot transmit on a distress frequency may use any other available frequency on which attention might be attracted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The safety signal and call must be followed by the safety message. Where practicable, the safety message should be sent on a working frequency, and a suitable announcement to this effect must be made at the end of the call.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Messages about meteorological warnings, of cyclones, dangerous ice, dangerous wrecks, or any other imminent danger to marine navigation must be preceded by the safety signal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Stations hearing the safety signal must not make any transmission likely to interfere with the message.
