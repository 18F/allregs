The preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to any real or personal property for which payments have been recaptured by the United States under title VII or VIII of the Act, with respect to any other property for which the transferring entity has refunded to the Federal Government the Federal share of the fair market value of such property, or with respect to any personal property which has only scrap value to both the entity and the agency, organization or individual to which the property is to be transferred.</p>
