                                Sec. 12.33  Use of wetland and converted wetland.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of Sec. 12.32(b)(2) are intended to protect  remaining values, acreage, and functions of the wetlands described  therein. Persons may continue to farm such wetlands under natural  conditions or as they did prior to December 23, 1985. However, no action  can be taken to increase effects on the water regime beyond that which  existed on such lands on or before December 23, 1985, unless NRCS  determines the effect on losing remaining wetland values would be  minimal under Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(v). If, after December 23, 1985, changes  due to human activity occurred in the watershed and resulted in an  increase in the water regime on a person's land, the person may be  allowed to adjust the existing drainage system to accommodate the  increased water regime on the condition that the person affected by this  additional water provides NRCS with appropriate documentation of the  increased water regime, the causes thereof, and the planned changes in  the existing drainage system. In order to maintain program eligibility,  a person must provide sufficient documentation and receive approval from  NRCS prior to making any changes that will have the effect of increasing  the capacity of the existing drainage systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise provided in this part, the production of an  agricultural commodity on land determined by NRCS to be prior-converted  cropland is exempted by law from these regulations for the area which  was converted. Maintenance or improvement of drainage systems on prior- converted croplands are not subject to this rule so long as the prior- converted croplands are used for the production of food, forage, or  fiber and as long as such actions do not alter the hydrology of nearby  wetlands or do not make possible the production of an agricultural  commodity on these other wetlands. Other wetlands under this section  means any natural wetland, farmed wetland, farmed-wetland pasture, or  any converted wetland that is not exempt under Sec. 12.5 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Abandonment is the cessation for five consecutive years of  management or maintenance operations related to the use of a farmed  wetland or a farmed-wetland pasture. Unless the criteria for receiving  an exemption under Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(iii) are met, such land is  considered to be abandoned when the land meets the wetland criteria of  Sec. 12.31. In order for documentation of site conditions to be  considered adequate under Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(iii), the affected person  must provide to NRCS available information concerning the extent of  hydrological manipulation, the extent of woody vegetation, and the  history of use. In accordance with Sec. 12.5(b)(1)(iii), participation  in a USDA approved wetland restoration, set-aside, diverted acres, or  similar programs shall not be deemed to constitute abandonment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The maintenance of the drainage capacity or any alteration or  manipulation, including the maintenance of a natural waterway operated  and maintained as a drainage outlet, that affects the circulation and  flow of water made to a farmed wetland or farmed-wetland pasture would  not cause a person to be determined to be ineligible under this part,  provided that the maintenance does not exceed the scope and effect of  the original alteration or manipulation, as determined by NRCS, and  provided that the area is not abandoned. Any resultant conversion of   wetlands is to be at the minimum extent practicable, as determined by  NRCS.  [61 FR 47025, Sept. 6, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 82077, Dec. 30, 2011]</p>
