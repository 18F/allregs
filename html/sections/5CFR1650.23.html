                            <p class="depth0">Upon receiving information from the employing agency that a  participant has been separated for more than 31 days and that any  outstanding loans have been closed, the TSP record keeper will  distribute the entire amount of his or her account balance if the  account balance is $5.00 or more but less than $200. The TSP will not  pay this amount by EFT. The participant may not elect to leave this  amount in the TSP, nor will the TSP transfer this amount to an eligible  employer plan, traditional IRA, or Roth IRA. However, the participant  may elect to roll over this payment into an eligible employer plan,  traditional IRA, or Roth IRA to the extent the roll over is permitted by  the Internal Revenue Code.
