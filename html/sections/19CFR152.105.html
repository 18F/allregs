                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Merchandise concerned. For the purposes of deductive value,  ``merchandise concerned'' means the merchandise being appraised,  identical merchandise, or similar merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Merchandise of the same class or kind. For the purposes of  deductive value, ``merchandise of the same class or kind'' includes  merchandise imported from the same country as well as other countries as  the merchandise being appraised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prices. The deductive value of the merchandise being appraised  is whichever of the following prices (as adjusted under paragraph (d) of  this section) is appropriate depending upon when and in what condition  the merchandise concerned is sold in the United States:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the merchandise concerned is sold in the condition as  imported at or about the date of importation of the merchandise being  appraised, the price is the unit price at which the merchandise  concerned is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity at or about such  date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the merchandise concerned is sold in the condition as  imported but not sold at or about the date of importation of the  merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit price at which the  merchandise concerned is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity after  the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised but before  the close of the 90th day after the date of such importation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the merchandise concerned was not sold in the condition as  imported and not sold before the close of the 90th day after the date of  importation of the merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit  price at which the merchandise being appraised, after further  processing, is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity before the 180th  day after the date of such importation. This provision will apply to  appraisement of merchandise only if the importer so elects at the time  of filing the entry summary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Deductions from price. The price determined under paragraph (c)  of this section will be reduced by an amount equal to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any commission usually paid or agreed to be paid, or the  addition usually made for profit and general expenses, in connection  with sales in the United States of imported merchandise that is of the  same class or kind, regardless of the country of exportation, as the  merchandise concerned;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The actual costs and associated costs of transportation and  insurance incurred with respect to international shipments of the  merchandise concerned from the country of exportation to the United  States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The usual costs and associated costs of transportation and  insurance incurred with respect to shipments of the merchandise  concerned from the place of importation to the place of delivery in the  United States, if those costs are not included as a general expense  under paragraph (d)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The customs duties and other Federal taxes currently payable on  the merchandise concerned by reason of its importation, and any Federal  excise tax on, or measured by the value of, the merchandise for which  vendors in the United States ordinarily are liable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> But only in the case of price determined under paragraph (c)(3)  of this section, the value added by the processing of the merchandise  after importation to the extent that the value is based on sufficient  information relating to the cost of that processing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Profit and general expenses; special rules. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The deduction  made for profit and general expenses (taken as a whole) will be based  upon the importer's profit and general expenses, unless the profit and  general expenses are inconsistent with those reflected in sales in the  United States of imported merchandise of the same class or kind from all  countries, in which case the deduction will be based on the usual profit  and general expenses reflected in those   sales, as determined from sufficient information. Any State or local tax  imposed on the importer with respect to the sale of imported merchandise  will be treated as a general expense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining deductions for commissions and usual profit and  general expenses, sales in the United States of the narrowest group or  range of imported merchandise of the same class or kind, including the  merchandise being appraised, for which sufficient information can be  provided, will be examined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Packing costs. The price determined under paragraph (c) of this  section will be increased, but only to the extent that the costs are not  otherwise included, by an amount equal to the packing costs incurred by  the importer or the buyer with respect to the merchandise concerned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Assists. For purposes of determining deductive value, any sale  to a person who supplies any assist for use in connection with the  production or sale for export of the merchandise concerned will be  disregarded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Unit price in greatest aggregate quantity. The unit price will  be established after a sufficient number of units have been sold to an  unrelated person. The unit price to be used when the units have been  sold in different quantities will be that at which the total volume sold  is greater than the total volume sold at any other unit price.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interpretative note 1. Merchandise is sold to an unrelated  person from a price list which grants favorable unit prices for  purchases made in larger quantities:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Total</p><p class="depth3">quantity</p><p class="depth3">Sale quantity             Unit     Number of sales     sold at</p><p class="depth3">price                          each</p><p class="depth3">price ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1-10 units......................     $100  10 sales of 5 units        65</p><p class="depth3">.......  5 sales of 3 units. 11-25 units.....................       95  5 sales of 11 units        55 Over 25 units...................       90  1 sale of 30 units.        80</p><p class="depth3">.......  1 sale of 50 units.  ........ ------------------------------------------------------------------------   The greatest number of units sold at a price is 80; therefore, the unit  price in the greatest aggregate quantity is $90.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interpretative note 2. Two sales to unrelated persons occur: in  the first sale, 500 units are sold at a price of $95 each; in the second  sale, 400 units are sold at a price of $90 each. In this example, the  greatest number of units sold at a particular price is 500; therefore,  the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is $95.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interpretative note 3. Various quantities are sold to unrelated  persons at various prices:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sales ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Unit</p><p class="depth4">Sale quantity                            price ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 40 units.....................................................       $100 30 units.....................................................         90 15 units.....................................................        100 50 units.....................................................         95 25 units.....................................................        105 35 units.....................................................         90 5 units......................................................        100 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Totals ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Unit</p><p class="depth4">Total quantity sold                         price ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 65...........................................................        $90 50...........................................................         95 60...........................................................        100 25...........................................................        105 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   In this example, the greatest number of units sold at a particular price  is 65; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is  $90.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Further processing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Quantified data. If merchandise has  undergone further processing after its importation into the United  States and the importer elects the method specified in paragraph (c)(3)  of this section, deductions made for the value added by that processing  will be based on objective and quantifiable data relating to the cost of  the work performed. Accepted industry formulas, recipes, methods of  construction, and other industry practices would form the basis for the  deduction. That deduction also will reflect amounts for spoilage, waste,  or scrap derived from the further processing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loss of identity. If the imported merchandise loses its identity  as a result of further processing, the method specified in paragraph  (c)(3) of this section will not be applicable unless the value added by  the processing can be determined accurately without unreasonable  difficulty for either importers or Customs. If the imported merchandise  maintains its identity but forms a   minor element of the merchandise sold in the United States, the use of  paragraph (c)(3) of this section will be unjustified. The port director  shall review each case involving these issues on its merits.</p><p class="depth3">Example. A foreign shipper sells merchandise to a related U.S.  importer. The foreign shipper does not sell to any unrelated person. The  transaction between the foreign shipper and the U.S. importer is  determined to have been affected by the relationship. There is no  identical or similar merchandise from the same country of production.  The U.S. importer further processes the product and sells the finished  product to an unrelated buyer in the U.S. within 180 days of the date of  importation. No assists from the unrelated U.S. buyer are involved, and  the type of processing involved can be accurately costed.</p><p class="depth3">How should the merchandise be appraised?</p><p class="depth3">The merchandise should be appraised under deductive value with  allowances for profit and general expenses, freight and insurance,  duties and taxes, and the cost of processing.  [T.D. 81-7, 46 FR 2600, Jan. 12, 1981, as amended by T.D. 85-123, 50 FR  29956, July 23, 1985]</p>
