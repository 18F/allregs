                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a State agency fails to correct violations as determined pursuant to Sec. 658.702, the Regional Administrator shall apply one or more of the following remedial actions to the State agency:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Imposition of special reporting requirements for a specified period of time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Restrictions of obligational authority within one or more expense classifications;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Implementation of specific operating systems or procedures for a specified time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requirement of special training for State agency personnel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> With the approval of the Assistant Secretary and after affording the State Administrator the opportunity to request a conference with the Assistant Secretary, the elevation of specific decision-making functions from the State Administrator to the Regional Administrator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> With the approval of the Assistant Secretary and after affording the State Administrator the opportunity to request a conference with the Assistant

Secretary, the imposition of Federal staff in key State agency positions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> With the approval of the Assistant Secretary and after affording the State Administrator the opportunity to request a conference with the Assistant Secretary, funding of the State agency on a short-term basis or partial withholding of funds for a specific function or for a specific geographical area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Holding of public hearings in the State on the State agency's deficiencies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Disallowance of funds pursuant to Sec. 658.702(g); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> If the matter involves a serious or continual violation, the initiation of decertification procedures against the State agency, as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Regional Administrator shall send, by registered mail, a Notice of Remedial Action to the State agency. The Notice of Remedial Action shall set forth the reasons for the remedial action. When such a notice is the result of violations of regulations governing services to MSFWs (20 CFR 653.100 et seq.) or the JS complaint system (20 CFR 658.400 et seq.), a copy of said notice shall be sent to the OWI Administrator, who shall publish the notice promptly in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the remedial action is other than decertification, the notice shall state that the remedial action shall take effect immediately. The notice shall also state that the State agency may request a hearing pursuant to Sec. 658.707 by filing a request in writing with the Regional Administrator pursuant to Sec. 658.707 within 20 working days of the State agency's receipt of the notice. The offer of hearing, or the acceptance thereof, however, shall not stay the implementation of remedial action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within 60 working days after the initial application of remedial action, the Regional Administrator shall conduct a review of the State agency's compliance with JS regulations unless the Regional Administrator determines that a longer time period is necessary. In such cases, the Regional Administrator shall notify the OWI Administrator in writing of the circumstances which necessitate a longer time period, and specify that time period. If necessary, ETA staff shall conduct a follow-up visit as part of this review. If the State agency is in compliance with the JS regulations, the Regional Administrator shall fully document these facts and shall terminate the remedial actions. The Regional Administrator shall notify the State agency of his/her findings. When the case involves violations of regulations governing services to MSFWs or the JS complaint system, a copy of said notice shall be sent to the OWI Administrator, who shall promptly publish the notice in the Federal Register. The Regional Administrator shall conduct, within a reasonable time after terminating the remedial actions, a review of the State agency's compliance to determine whether any remedial actions should be reapplied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If, upon conducting the on-site review referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, the Regional Administrator finds that the State agency remains in noncompliance, the Regional Administrator shall continue the remedial action and/or impose different additional remedial actions. The Regional Administrator shall fully document all such decisions and, when the case involves violations of regulations governing services to MSFWs or the JS complaint system, shall send copies to the OWI Administrator, who shall promptly publish the notice in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(1)</em> If the State agency has not brought itself into compliance with JS regulations within 120 working days of the initial application of remedial action, the Regional Administrator shall initiate decertification unless the Regional Administrator determines that circumstances necessitate continuing remedial action for a longer period of time. In such cases, the Regional Administrator shall notify the OWI Administrator in writing of the circumstances which necessitate the longer time period, and specify the time period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the State agency has not brought itself into compliance with JS regulations within 120 working days of the initial application of remedial action, the Regional Administrator shall initiate decertification unless the Regional Administrator determines that circumstances necessitate continuing remedial action for a longer period of time. In such cases, the Regional Administrator shall notify the OWI Administrator in writing of the circumstances which necessitate the longer time period, and specify the time period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Regional Administrator shall notify the State agency by registered mail of the decertification proceedings, and shall state the reasons therefor. Whenever such a notice is sent to a State agency, the Regional Administrator shall prepare five indexed copies

containing, in chronological order, all the documents pertinent to the case along with a request for decertification stating the grounds therefor. One copy shall be retained. Two shall be sent to the ETA national office, one shall be sent to the Solicitor of Labor, Attention: Associate Solicitor for Employment and Training, and, if the case involves violations of regulations governing services to MSFWs or the complaint system, one copy shall be sent to the National MSFW Monitor Advocate. The notice sent by the Regional Administrator shall be published promptly in the Federal Register.
