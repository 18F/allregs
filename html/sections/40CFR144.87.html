                                Sec.  144.87  How does the identification of ground water protection
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You are subject to these new requirements if you own or operate  an existing motor vehicle well and you are located in a ground water  protection area or an other sensitive ground water area. If your State  or EPA Region fails to identify these areas within the specified time  frames these requirements apply to all existing motor vehicle waste  disposal wells within your State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ground water protection areas. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the purpose of this  subpart, States are required to complete all local source water  assessments for ground water protection areas by January 1, 2004. Once a  local assessment for a ground water protection area is complete every  existing motor vehicle waste disposal well owner in that ground water  protection area has one year to close the well or receive a permit. If a  State fails to complete all local assessments for ground water  protection areas by January 1, 2004, the following may occur:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The new requirements in this subpart will apply to all existing  motor vehicle waste disposal wells in the State and owners and operators  of motor vehicle waste disposal wells located outside of completed  assessments for ground water protection areas must close their well or  receive a permit by January 1, 2005.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> EPA may grant a State an extension for up to one year from the  January 1, 2004 deadline if the State is making reasonable progress in  completing the source water assessments for ground water protection  areas. States must apply for the extension by June 1, 2003. If a State  fails to complete the assessments for the remaining ground water  protection areas by the extended date the rule requirements will apply  to all motor vehicle waste disposal wells in the State and owners and  operators of motor vehicle waste disposal wells located outside of  ground water protection areas with completed assessments must close  their well or receive a permit by January 1, 2006.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The UIC Program Director may extend the compliance deadline for  specific motor vehicle waste disposal wells for up to one year if the  most efficient compliance option for the well is connection to a  sanitary sewer or installation of new treatment technology.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other sensitive ground water areas. States may also delineate  other sensitive ground water areas by January 1, 2004. Existing motor  vehicle waste disposal well owners and operators within other sensitive  ground water areas have until January 1, 2007 to receive a permit or  close the well. If a State or EPA Region fails to identify these  additional sensitive ground water areas by January 1, 2004, the new  requirements of this rule will apply to all motor vehicle waste disposal  wells in the State effective January 1, 2007 unless they are subject to  a different compliance date pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.  Again, EPA may extend the January 1, 2004 deadline for up to one year  for States to delineate other sensitive ground water areas if the State  is making reasonable progress in identifying the sensitive areas. States  must apply for this extension by June 1, 2003. If a State has been  granted an extension, existing motor vehicle waste disposal well owners  and operators within the sensitive ground water areas have until January  1, 2008 to close the well or receive a permit, unless they are subject  to a different compliance date pursuant to paragraph (b) of this  section. If a State has been granted an extension and fails to delineate  sensitive areas by the extended date, the rule requirements will apply  to all motor vehicle waste disposal   wells in the State and owners and operators have until January 1, 2008  to close the well or receive a permit, unless they are subject to a  different compliance date pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> How to find out if your well is in a ground water protection  area or sensitive ground water area. States are required to make their  local source water assessments widely available to the public through a  variety of methods after the assessments are complete. You can find out  if your Class V well is in a ground water protection area by contacting  the State agency responsible for the State Drinking Water Source  Assessment and Protection Program in your area. You may call the Safe  Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791 to find out who to call in your  State for this information. The State office responsible for  implementing the Drinking Water Source Assessment and Protection Program  makes the final and official determination of boundaries for ground  water protection areas. Because States that choose to delineate other  sensitive ground water areas are also required to make the information  on these areas accessible to the public, they may do so in a manner  similar to the process used by the States in publicizing the EPA  approved Drinking Water Source Assessment and Protection Program. You  can find out if your Class V well is in an other sensitive ground water  area by contacting the State or Federal agency responsible for the  Underground Injection Control Program. You may call the Safe Drinking  Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791 to find out who to call for information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Changes in the status of the EPA approved state drinking water  source assessment and protection program. After January 1, 2004 your  State may assess a ground water protection area for ground water  supplying a new community water system or a new non-transient non- community water system that includes your Class V injection well. Also,  your State may officially re-delineate the boundaries of a previously  delineated ground water protection area to include additional areas that  includes your motor vehicle waste disposal well. This would make the  additional regulations apply to you if your motor vehicle waste disposal  well is in such an area. The additional regulations start applying to  you one year after the State completes the local assessment for the  ground water protection area for the new drinking water system or the  new re-delineated area. The UIC Program Director responsible for your  area may extend this deadline for up to one year if the most efficient  compliance option for the well is connection to a sanitary sewer or  installation of new treatment technology.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> What happens if my state doesn't designate other sensitive  ground water areas? If your State or EPA Region elects not to delineate  the additional sensitive ground water areas, the additional regulations  apply to you regardless of the location of your well by January 1, 2007,  or January 2008 if an extension has been granted as explained in  paragraph (c) of this section, except for wells in ground water  protection areas which are subject to different compliance deadlines  explained in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Application of requirements outside of ground water protection  areas and sensitive ground water areas. EPA expects and strongly  encourages States to use existing authorities in the UIC program to take  whatever measures are needed to ensure Class V wells are not endangering  USDWs in any other areas outside of delineated ground water protection  areas and sensitive ground water areas. Such measures could include, if  believed to be necessary by a UIC Program Director, applying the  additional requirements below to other areas and/or other types of Class  V wells. Therefore, the Director may apply the additional requirements  to you, even if you are not located in the areas listed in paragraph (a)  of this section.</p>
