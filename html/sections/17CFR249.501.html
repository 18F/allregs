Disclosure of the information specified in this form is  mandatory prior to processing of applications for withdrawal, except for  social security account numbers, disclosure of which is voluntary. The  information will be used for the primary purpose of determining whether  it is in the public interest to permit a broker-dealer to withdraw his  registration. This notice will be made a matter of public record.  Therefore, any information, given will be available for inspection by  any member of the public. Because of the public nature of the  information the Commission can utilize it for a variety of purposes,  including referral to other governmental authorities or securities self- regulatory organizations for investigatory purposes or in connection  with litigation involving the Federal securities laws and other civil,  criminal or regulatory statutes or provisions. Social security account  numbers, if furnished, will assist the Commission in identifying  registrants and, therefore, in promptly processing applications for  withdrawal. Failure to disclose the information requested by Form BDW,  except for social security account numbers, may result in the registrant  not being permitted to withdraw his registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interim Form BDW shall be used for application for registration  as broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or to amend  such application, only by order of the Commission.
