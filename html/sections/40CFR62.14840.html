The CISWI unit does not include air pollution control equipment or the stack. The CISWI unit boundary starts at the commercial and industrial solid waste hopper (if applicable) and extends through two areas:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The combustion unit flue gas system, which ends immediately after the last combustion chamber.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The combustion unit bottom ash system, which ends at the truck loading station or similar equipment that transfers the ash to final disposal. It includes all ash handling systems connected to the bottom ash handling system.</p><p class="depth0">Commercial and industrial waste, for the purposes of this subpart, means solid waste combusted in an enclosed device using controlled flame combustion without energy recovery that is a distinct operating unit of any commercial or industrial facility (including field-erected, modular, and custom built incineration units operating with starved or excess air), or solid waste combusted in an air curtain incinerator without energy recovery that is a distinct operating unit of any commercial or industrial facility.</p><p class="depth0">Contained gaseous material means gases that are in a container when that container is combusted.</p><p class="depth0">Cyclonic barrel burner means a combustion device for waste materials that is attached to a 55 gallon, open-head drum.

permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fails to meet any emission limitation, operating limit, or operator qualification and accessibility requirement in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless or whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Dioxins/furans means tetra-through octachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans.</p><p class="depth0">Discard means, for purposes of this subpart and 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDDD, only, burned in an incineration unit without energy recovery.</p><p class="depth0">Drum reclamation unit means a unit that burns residues out of drums (e.g., 55 gallon drums) so that the drums can be reused.</p><p class="depth0">Energy recovery means the process of recovering thermal energy from combustion for useful purposes such as steam generation or process heating.</p><p class="depth0">Fabric filter means an add-on air pollution control device used to capture particulate matter by filtering gas streams through filter media, also known as a baghouse.</p><p class="depth0">Low-level radioactive waste means waste material which contains radioactive nuclides emitting primarily beta or gamma radiation, or both, in concentrations or quantities that exceed applicable Federal or State standards for unrestricted release.

Failures that are caused, in part, by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.</p><p class="depth0">Modification or modified CISWI unit means a CISWI unit you have changed later than promulgation of the final CISWI emission guidelines in 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDDD and that meets one of two criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The cumulative cost of the changes over the life of the unit exceeds 50 percent of the original cost of building and installing the CISWI unit (not including the cost of land) updated to current costs (current dollars). To determine what systems are within the boundary of the CISWI unit used to calculate these costs, see the definition of CISWI unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any physical change in the CISWI unit or change in the method of operating it that increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted for which section 129 or section 111 of the Clean Air Act has established standards.</p><p class="depth0">Particulate matter means total particulate matter emitted from CISWI units as measured by Method 5 or Method 29 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">Parts reclamation unit means a unit that burns coatings off parts (e.g., tools, equipment) so that the parts can be reconditioned and reused.</p><p class="depth0">Pathological waste means waste material consisting of only human or animal remains, anatomical parts, and/or tissue, the bags/containers used to collect and transport the waste material, and animal bedding (if applicable).</p><p class="depth0">Rack reclamation unit means a unit that burns the coatings off racks used to hold small items for application of a coating.
