During the 200-stop burnish procedure, the  propulsion batteries are restored to the maximum state of charge  determined as above, after each increment of 40 burnish stops until the  burnish procedure is complete. The batteries may be charged at a more  frequent interval during a particular 40-stop increment only if the EV  is incapable of achieving the initial burnish test speed during that  increment. During the burnish procedure, the propulsion batteries may be  charged by external means or replaced by batteries that are at a state  of charge of not less than 95 percent. For an EV having a manual control  for setting the level of regenerative braking, the manual control, at  the beginning of the burnish procedure, is set to provide maximum  regenerative braking throughout the burnish.</p><p class="depth0">S6.3.11.3 At the beginning of each performance test in the test  sequence (S7.2 through S7.17 of this standard), unless otherwise  specified, an EV's propulsion batteries are at the state of charge  recommended by the manufacturer, as stated in the vehicle operator's  manual or on a label that is permanently attached to the vehicle, or, if  the manufacturer has made no recommendation, at a state of charge of not  less than 95 percent. No further charging of any propulsion battery  occurs during any of the performance tests in the test sequence of this  standard. If the propulsion batteries are depleted during a test  sequence such that the vehicle reaches automatic shut-down, will not  accelerate, or the low state of charge brake warning lamp is  illuminated, the vehicle is to be accelerated to brake test speed by  auxiliary means. If a battery is replaced rather than recharged, the  replacement battery shall be charged and measured for state of charge in  accordance with these procedures.</p><p class="depth0">S6.3.12 State of charge of batteries for electrically-actuated  service brakes. A vehicle equipped with electrically-actuated service  brakes also performs the following test series. Conduct 10 stopping  tests from a speed of 100 kph or the maximum vehicle speed, whichever is  less. At least two of the 10 stopping distances must be less than or  equal to 70 meters. The vehicle is loaded to GVWR and the transmission  is in the neutral position when the service brake control is actuated  and throughout the remainder of the test. Each battery providing power  to the electrically-actuated service brakes, shall be in a depleted  state of charge for conditions (a), (b), or (c) of this paragraph as  appropriate.
