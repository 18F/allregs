                                Sec. 49.4291-1  Persons receiving payment must collect tax.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided in section 4263(a), every person  receiving any payment for facilities or services on which a tax is  imposed upon the payor thereof under chapter 33 shall collect the amount  of the tax from the person making that payment. Under section 7501, all  taxes collected in this manner are held by the collecting agent in trust  for the United States. If the person from whom the tax is required to be  collected refuses to pay it or if for any reason it is impossible for  the collecting agent to collect the tax from that person, the collecting  agent is required to report to the Commissioner the name and address of  that person, the nature of the facility provided or service rendered,  the amount paid therefore, and the date on which paid. Applicable  October 1, 2004, this report must be made on or before the report due  date. Upon receipt of this report the Commissioner will proceed against  the person to whom the facilities were provided or the services rendered  to assert the amount of tax due, affording that person the same  conference, protest, and appellate rights as are available to other  excise taxpayers. In addition, when a field or office audit of a  collecting agent's records, or of a taxpayer's records, discloses that  the collecting agent failed during prior reporting periods to collect  taxes due, the Commissioner may assert those taxes directly against the  person to   whom the facilities were provided or the services rendered, whether or  not the collecting agent had attempted collection or the person liable  for the tax had refused payment thereof. For purposes of this section,  the report due date is--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the case of a person using the alternative method of making  deposits described in Sec. 40.6302(c)-3 of this chapter, the due date  of the return on which the item of adjustment relating to the  uncollected tax would be reflected if items of adjustment were  determined without regard to the limitation in Sec. 40.6302(c)-3 of  this chapter; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In any other case, the due date of the return on which the tax  would have been reported but for the refusal to pay or inability to  collect.
