Such statement may not be misleading in any  particular.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Representations as to the total amount of object or objects to  which the commodity may be applied or upon which or in which the  commodity may be used, will not be considered to be representations as  to servings, uses, or applications, if such amount is expressed in terms  of standard units of weight or mass, measure, size, or count.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If there exists a voluntary product standard promulgated  pursuant to the procedures found in 15 CFR part 10, by the Department of  Commerce, quantitatively defining the meaning of the terms serving, use,  or application with respect to a particular consumer commodity, then any  label representation as to the number of servings, uses, or applications  in such packaged consumer commodity shall correspond with such  quantitative definition.
