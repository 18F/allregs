                                Sec. 1.527-4  Special rules for computation of political organization
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Political organization taxable income is determined  according to the provisions of section 527(b) and the rules set forth in  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitation on capital losses. If for any taxable year a  political organization has a net capital loss, the rules of sections  1211(a) and 1212(a) apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allowable deductions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. To be deductible in  computing political organization taxable income, expenses, depreciation,  and similar items must not only qualify as deductions allowed by chapter  1 of the Code, but must also be directly connected with the production  of political organization taxable income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Directly connected with defined. To be directly connected with  the production of political organization taxable income, an item of  deduction must have a proximate and primary relationship to the  production of such income and have been incurred in the production of  such income. Items of deduction attributable solely to items of  political organization taxable income are proximately and primarily  related to such income. Whether an item of deduction is incurred in the  production of political organization taxable income is determined on the  basis of all the facts and circumstances of each case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dual use of facilities or personnel. Expenses, depreciation, and  similar items that are attributable to the production of exempt function  income and political organization taxable income shall be allocated  between the two on a reasonable and consistent basis. For example, where  facilities are used both for an exempt function of the organization and  for the production of political organization taxable income, expenses,   depreciation, and similar items attributable to such facilities (for  example, items of overhead) shall be allocated between the two uses of a  reasonable and consistent basis. Similarly, where personnel are employed  both for an exempt function and for the production of political  organization taxable income, expenses and similar items attributable to  such personnel (for example, items of salary) shall be allocated between  the activities on a reasonable and consistent basis. The portion of any  such item so allocated to the production of political organization  taxable income is directly connected with such income and is allowable  as a deduction in computing political organization taxable income to the  extent that it qualifies as an item of deduction allowed by chapter 1 of  the Code. Thus, for example, assume that X, a political organization,  pays its manager a salary of $10,000 a year and that it derives  political organization taxable income. If 10 percent of the manager's  time during the year is devoted to deriving X's gross income (other than  exempt function income), a deduction of $1,000 (10 percent of $10,000)  would generally be allowable for purposes of computing X's political  organization taxable income.
