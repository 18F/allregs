                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands (48 U.S.C. 1642),  as modified by section 7651(5)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> provides an exception to the application of section 934(a).  Under this exception, section 934(a) does not apply with respect to tax  liability incurred to the Virgin Islands to the extent that such tax  liability is attributable to income derived from sources within the  Virgin Islands or income effectively connected with the conduct of a  trade or business within the Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> limits the scope of the exception  provided by section 934(b)(1). Pursuant to this limitation, the  exception does not apply with respect to an individual who is a citizen  or resident of the United States (other than a bona fide resident of the  Virgin Islands). For the rules for determining tax liability incurred to  the Virgin Islands by such an individual, see section 932(a) and the  regulations under that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Computation rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Operative rule. For purposes of section  934(b)(1) and this paragraph (b), tax liability incurred to the Virgin  Islands for the taxable year attributable to income derived from sources  within the Virgin Islands or income effectively connected with the  conduct of a trade or business within the Virgin Islands will be  computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Add to the income tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands  any credit against the tax allowed under mirrored section 901(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Multiply by taxable income from sources within the Virgin  Islands and income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or  business within the Virgin Islands (applying the rules of Sec. 1.861-8  to determine deductions allocable to such income).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Divide by total taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Subtract the portion of any credit allowed under mirrored  section 901 (other than credits for taxes paid to the United States)  determined by multiplying the amount of taxable income from sources  outside the Virgin Islands or the United States that is effectively  connected to the conduct of a trade or business in the Virgin Islands  divided by the total amount of taxable income from such sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitation. Tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands  attributable to income derived from sources within the Virgin Islands or  income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business  within the Virgin Islands, as computed in this paragraph (b)(3),  however, will not exceed the total amount of income tax liability  actually incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Bona fide resident. The rules of Sec. 1.937-1 will apply for  determining   whether an individual is a bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Source. The rules of Sec. 1.937-2 will apply for determining  whether income is from sources within the Virgin Islands; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effectively connected income. The rules of Sec. 1.937-3 will  apply for determining whether income is effectively connected with the  conduct of a trade or business in the Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exception for qualified foreign corporations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  Section 934(b)(3) provides an exception to the application of section  934(a). Under this exception, section 934(a) does not apply with respect  to tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands by a qualified foreign  corporation to the extent that such tax liability is attributable to  income that is derived from sources outside the United States and that  is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business  within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualified foreign corporation. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)  of this section, the term qualified foreign corporation means any  foreign corporation if 1 or more United States persons own or are  treated as owning (within the meaning of section 958) less than 10  percent of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The total voting power of the stock of such corporation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The total value of the stock of such corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Computation rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Operative rule. For purposes of section  934(b)(3) and this paragraph (c), tax liability incurred to the Virgin  Islands for the taxable year attributable to income that is derived from  sources outside the United States and that is not effectively connected  with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States will be  computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Add to the income tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands  any credit against the tax allowed under mirrored section 901(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Multiply by taxable income that is derived from sources outside  the United States and that is not effectively connected with the conduct  of a trade or business within the United States (applying the rules of  Sec. 1.861-8 to determine deductions allocable to such income).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Divide by total taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Subtract any credit allowed under mirrored section 901 (other  than credits for taxes paid to the United States or taxes for which a  credit is allowable for Federal income tax purposes under section 906 of  the Code).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitation. Tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands  attributable to income that is derived from sources outside the United  States and that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade  or business within the United States, as computed in this paragraph  (c)(3), however, will not exceed the total amount of income tax  liability actually incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> U.S. income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this section,  except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the rules of  sections 861 through 865 and the regulations under those provisions will  apply for determining whether income is from sources outside the United  States or effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business  within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conduit arrangements. Income will be considered to be from  sources within the United States for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of  this section if, pursuant to a plan or arrangement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The income is received in exchange for consideration provided to  another person; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Such person (or another person) provides the same consideration  (or consideration of a like kind) to a third person in exchange for one  or more payments constituting income from sources within the United  States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The rules of this section are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> S is a U.S. citizen and a bona fide resident of the  Virgin Islands. For 2008, S files a Form 1040INFO, ``Non-Virgin Islands  Source Income of Virgin Islands Residents,'' with the Virgin Islands on  which S reports total gross income as follows:  Compensation for services performed in the Virgin Islands--$50,000 Compensation for services performed in the United States--$40,000 Compensation for services performed in Mexico--$30,000 Income from inventory sales in Latin America attributable to Virgin  Islands office--$20,000 Interest on a U.S. bank account--$6,000   Interest on a V.I. bank account--$5,000 Dividends from a U.S. corporation--$4,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Accordingly, S has total gross income of $155,000, comprising  income from sources within the Virgin Islands or effectively connected  to the conduct of a trade or business in the Virgin Islands (Virgin  Islands ECI) of $75,000, income from sources within the United States of  $50,000, and income from other sources (not Virgin Islands ECI) of  $30,000. After taking into account allowable deductions, S's total  taxable income is $120,000, of which $45,000 is taxable income from  sources within the Virgin Islands, $15,000 is taxable income from other  sources that is Virgin Islands ECI under the rules of section 937(b) and  Secs. 1.937-2 and 1.937-3, and $22,500 is taxable income from sources  outside the Virgin Islands (and outside the United States) that is not  Virgin Islands ECI. S's tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands  pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code as applicable in the Virgin  Islands (mirror code) is $30,000. S is entitled to claim a credit under  section 901 of the mirror code in the amount of $10,000 for income tax  paid to Mexico and other Latin American countries, for a net income tax  liability of $20,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pursuant to a Virgin Islands law that was duly enacted within  the limits of its authority under section 934, S may claim a special  deduction relating to his business activities in the Virgin Islands.  However, under section 934(b), S's ability to claim this special  deduction is limited. Specifically, the maximum amount of the reduction  in S's mirror code tax liability that may result from claiming this  deduction, computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section,  is as follows: [($20,000 + $10,000) x (($45,000 + $15,000) / $120,000)]  - [$10,000 x ($15,000 / ($15,000 + $22,500))] = [$30,000 x ($60,000 /  $120,000)] - [$10,000 x ($15,000 / $37,500)] = ($30,000 x 0.5) -  ($10,000 x 0.4) = $15,000 - $4,000 = $11,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Accordingly, S's net tax liability incurred to the Virgin  Islands must be at least $19,000 ($30,000 - $11,000), prior to taking  into account any foreign tax credit.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as Example 1, except that S is a  U.S. citizen who resides in the United States. As required by section  932(a) and (b), S files with the Virgin Islands a copy of his Federal  income tax return and pays to the Virgin Islands the portion of his  Federal income tax liability that his Virgin Islands adjusted gross  income bears to his adjusted gross income. Under section 934(b)(2), S  may not claim the special deduction offered under Virgin Islands law  relating to business activities like his in the Virgin Islands to reduce  any of his tax liability payable to the Virgin Islands under section  932(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Z is a nonresident alien who resides in Country FC.  In 2008, Z receives dividends from a corporation organized under the law  of the Virgin Islands in the amount of $90x. Z's tax liability incurred  to the Virgin Islands pursuant to section 871(a) of the Code as  applicable in the Virgin Islands (mirror code) is $27x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to a Virgin Islands law that was duly enacted within  the limits of its authority under section 934, Z may claim a special  exemption for income relating to his investment in the Virgin Islands.  The maximum amount of the reduction in Z's mirror code tax liability  that may result from claiming this exemption, computed in accordance  with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, is as follows: $27x x ($90x/$90x)  = $27x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Accordingly, depending on the terms of the exemption as  provided under Virgin Islands law, Z's net tax liability incurred to the  Virgin Islands may be reduced or eliminated entirely.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A Corp is organized under the laws of the Virgin  Islands and is engaged in a trade or business in the United States  through an office in State N. All of A Corp's outstanding stock is owned  by U.S. citizens who are bona fide residents of the Virgin Islands.  During 2008, A Corp had $50x in gross income from sources within the  Virgin Islands (as determined under section 937(b) and Sec. 1.937-2)  that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or  business in the United States; $20x in gross income from sources in  Country H that is effectively connected with the conduct of A Corp's  trade or business in the United States; and $10x in gross income from  sources in Country R that is not effectively connected with the conduct  of A Corp's trade or business in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 934(b)(3) permits the Virgin Islands to reduce or remit  the income tax liability of a qualified foreign corporation arising  under the Code as applicable in the Virgin Islands (mirror code) with  respect to income that is derived from sources outside the United States  and that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or  business in the United States. A foreign corporation constitutes a  ``qualified foreign corporation'' under section 934(b)(3)(B) if less  than 10 percent of the total voting power and value of the stock of the  corporation is owned or treated as owned (within the meaning of section  958) by one or more United States persons. A U.S. citizen is a ``United  States person'' as defined in section 7701(a)(30)(A). Given that 10  percent or more of the voting power and value of its stock is owned by  U.S. citizens, A Corp does not constitute a ``qualified foreign  corporation'' under section 934(b)(3)(B). Accordingly, the Virgin  Islands may only reduce or remit A Corp's mirror code income tax  liability with respect to its $50x in gross income from sources within  the Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that  the outstanding stock   of A Corp is owned by the following individuals: U.S. citizens who are bona fide residents of the Virgin Islands--5% U.S. citizens who are not bona fide residents of the Virgin Islands--3% Nonresident aliens who are bona fide residents of the Virgin Islands-- 42% Nonresident aliens who are not bona fide residents of the Virgin  Islands--50%</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Given that less than 10 percent of the voting power and value  of its stock is owned by United States persons, A Corp constitutes a  qualified foreign corporation under section 934(b)(3)(B). Accordingly,  the Virgin Islands may reduce or remit A Corp's mirror code income tax  liability with respect to its $50x in gross income from sources within  the Virgin Islands and its $10x in gross income from sources in Country  R that is not effectively connected with the conduct of A Corp's trade  or business in the United States. In no event, however, may the Virgin  Islands reduce or remit A Corp's mirror code income tax liability with  respect to its $20x in gross income from sources in Country H that is  effectively connected with the conduct of A Corp's trade or business in  the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies for taxable  years ending after April 9, 2008.  [T.D. 9391, 73 FR 19365, Apr. 9, 2008]</p>
