                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Temporary import of defense articles. Port Directors of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and postmasters shall permit the temporary import and return to Canada without a license of any unclassified defense articles (see Sec. 120.6 of this subchapter) that originate in Canada for temporary use in the United States and return to Canada. All other temporary imports shall be in accordance with Sec. Sec. 123.3 and 123.4 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permanent and temporary export of defense articles. Except as provided in Supplement No. 1 to part 126 of this subchapter and for exports that transit third countries, Port Directors of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and postmasters shall permit, when for end-use in Canada by Canadian Federal or Provincial governmental authorities acting in an official capacity or by a Canadian-registered person, or for return to the United States, the permanent and temporary export to Canada without a license of unclassified defense articles and defense services identified on the U.S. Munitions List (22 CFR 121.1). The exceptions are subject to meeting the requirements of this subchapter, to include 22 CFR 120.1(c) and (d), parts 122 and 123 (except insofar as exemption from licensing requirements is herein authorized) and Sec. 126.1, and the requirement to obtain non-transfer and use assurances for all significant military equipment. For purposes of this section, ``Canadian-registered person'' is any Canadian national (including Canadian business entities organized under the laws of Canada), dual citizen of Canada and a third country other than a country listed in Sec. 126.1 of this subchapter, and permanent resident registered in Canada in accordance with the Canadian Defense Production Act, and such other Canadian Crown Corporations identified by the Department of State in a list of such persons publicly available through the Internet Web site of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and by other means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reexports/retransfer. Reexport/retransfer in Canada to another end-user or end-use or from Canada to another destination, except the United States, must in all instances have the prior approval of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Unless otherwise exempt in this subchapter, the original exporter is responsible, upon request from a Canadian-registered person, for obtaining or providing reexport/retransfer approval. In any instance when the U.S. exporter is no longer available to the Canadian end-user the request for reexport/retransfer may be made directly to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. All requests must include the information in Sec. 123.9(c) of this subchapter. Reexport/retransfer approval is acquired by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the reexport/retransfer being requested could be made pursuant to this section (i.e., a retransfer within Canada to another eligible Canadian recipient under this section) if exported directly from the U.S., upon receipt by the U.S. company of a request by a Canadian end user, the original U.S. exporter is authorized to grant on behalf of the U.S. Government by confirming in writing to the Canadian requester that the reexport/retransfer is authorized subject to the conditions of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the reexport/retransfer is to an end use or end user that, if directly exported from the U.S. requires a license, retransfer must be handled in accordance with Sec. 123.9 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth3">Notes to Sec. 126.5: 1. In any instance when the exporter has knowledge that the defense article exempt from licensing is being exported for use other than by a qualified Canadian-registered person or for export to another foreign destination, other than the United States, in its original form or incorporated into another item, an export license must be obtained prior to the transfer to Canada.</p><p class="depth3">2. Additional exemptions exist in other sections of this subchapter that are applicable to Canada, for example Sec. Sec. 123.9, 125.4, and

124.2, that allow for the performance of defense services related to training in basic operations and maintenance, without a license, for certain defense articles lawfully exported, including those identified in Supplement No. 1 to part 126 of this subchapter.
