                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 48.202, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Value Engineering--Construction (OCT 2015)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Contractor is encouraged to develop, prepare, and  submit value engineering change proposals (VECP's) voluntarily. The  Contractor shall share in any instant contract savings realized from  accepted VECP's, in accordance with paragraph (f) below.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. Collateral costs, as used in this clause, means  agency costs of operation, maintenance, logistic support, or Government- furnished property.</p><p class="depth2">Collateral savings, as used in this clause, means those measurable  net reductions resulting from a VECP in the agency's overall projected  collateral costs, exlcusive of acquisition savings, whether or not the  acquisition cost changes.</p><p class="depth2">Contractor's development and implementation costs, as used in this  clause, means those costs the Contractor incurs on a VECP specifically  in developing, testing, preparing, and submitting the VECP, as well as  those costs the Contractor incurs to make the contractual changes  required by Government acceptance of a VECP.</p><p class="depth2">Government costs, as used in this clause, means those agency costs  that result directly from developing and implementing the VECP, such as  any net increases in the cost of testing, operations, maintenance, and  logistic support. The term does not include the normal administrative  costs of processing the VECP.</p><p class="depth2">Instant contract savings, as used in this clause, means the  estimated reduction in Contractor cost of performance resulting from  acceptance of the VECP, minus allowable Contractor's development and  implementation costs, including subcontractors' development and  implementation costs (see paragraph (h) below).</p><p class="depth2">Value engineering change proposal (VECP) means a proposal that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requires a change to this, the instant contract, to implement;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Results in reducing the contract price or estimated cost without  impairing essential functions or characteristics; provided, that it does  not involve a change--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In deliverable end item quantities only; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To the contract type only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> VECP preparation. As a minimum, the Contractor shall include in  each VECP the information described in subparagraphs (1) through (7)  below. If the proposed change is affected by contractually required  configuration management or similar procedures, the instructions in  those procedures relating to format, identification, and priority  assignment shall govern VECP preparation. The VECP shall include the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the difference between the existing contract  requirement and that proposed, the comparative advantages and  disadvantages of each, a justification when an item's function or  characteristics are being altered, and the effect of the change on the  end item's performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A list and analysis of the contract requirements that must be  changed if the VECP is accepted, including any suggested specification  revisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A separate, detailed cost estimate for (i) the affected portions  of the existing contract requirement and (ii) the VECP. The   cost reduction associated with the VECP shall take into account the  Contractor's allowable development and implementation costs, including  any amount attributable to subcontracts under paragraph (h) below.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description and estimate of costs the Government may incur in  implementing the VECP, such as test and evaluation and operating and  support costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A prediction of any effects the proposed change would have on  collateral costs to the agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A statement of the time by which a contract modification  accepting the VECP must be issued in order to achieve the maximum cost  reduction, noting any effect on the contract completion time or delivery  schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Identification of any previous submissions of the VECP,  including the dates submitted, the agencies and contract numbers  involved, and previous Government actions, if known.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Submission. The Contractor shall submit VECP's to the Resident  Engineer at the worksite, with a copy to the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Government action. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contracting Officer will notify the  Contractor of the status of the VECP within 45 calendar days after the  contracting office receives it. If additional time is required, the  Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within the 45-day period  and provide the reason for the delay and the expected date of the  decision. The Government will process VECP's expeditiously; however, it  will not be liable for any delay in acting upon a VECP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the VECP is not accepted, the Contracting Officer will notify  the Contractor in writing, explaining the reasons for rejection. The  Contractor may withdraw any VECP, in whole or in part, at any time  before it is accepted by the Government. The Contracting Officer may  require that the Contractor provide written notification before  undertaking significant expenditures for VECP effort.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any VECP may be accepted, in whole or in part, by the  Contracting Officer's award of a modification to this contract citing  this clause. The Contracting Officer may accept the VECP, even though an  agreement on price reduction has not been reached, by issuing the  Contractor a notice to proceed with the change. Until a notice to  proceed is issued or a contract modification applies a VECP to this  contract, the Contractor shall perform in accordance with the existing  contract. The decision to accept or reject all or part of any VECP is a  unilateral decision made solely at the discretion of the Contracting  Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Sharing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rates. The Government's share of savings is  determined by subtracting Government costs from instant contract savings  and multiplying the result by (i) 45 percent for fixed-price contracts  or (ii) 75 percent for cost-reimbursement contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment. Payment of any share due the Contractor for use of a  VECP on this contract shall be authorized by a modification to this  contract to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Accept the VECP;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reduce the contract price or estimated cost by the amount of  instant contract savings; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide the Contractor's share of savings by adding the amount  calculated to the contract price or fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Collateral savings. If a VECP is accepted, the Contracting  Officer will increase the instant contract amount by 20 percent of any  projected collateral savings determined to be realized in a typical year  of use after subtracting any Government costs not previously offset.  However, the Contractor's share of collateral savings will not exceed  the contract's firm-fixed-price or estimated cost, at the time the VECP  is accepted, or $100,000, whichever is greater. The Contracting Officer  is the sole determiner of the amount of collateral savings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include an appropriate value  engineering clause in any subcontract of $70,000 or more and may include  one in subcontracts of lesser value. In computing any adjustment in this  contract's price under paragraph (f) above, the Contractor's allowable  development and implementation costs shall include any subcontractor's  allowable development and implementation costs clearly resulting from a  VECP accepted by the Government under this contract, but shall exclude  any value engineering incentive payments to a subcontractor. The  Contractor may choose any arrangement for subcontractor value  engineering incentive payments; provided, that these payments shall not  reduce the Government's share of the savings resulting from the VECP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Data. The Contractor may restrict the Government's right to use  any part of a VECP or the supporting data by marking the following  legend on the affected parts:  ``These data, furnished under the Value Engineering--Construction clause  of contract ----, shall not be disclosed outside the Government or  duplicated, used, or disclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose  other than to evaluate a value engineering change proposal submitted  under the clause. This restriction does not limit the Government's right  to use information contained in these data if it has been obtained or is  otherwise available from the Contractor or from another source without  limitations.''</p><p class="depth2">If a VECP is accepted, the Contractor hereby grants the Government  unlimited rights in the VECP and supporting data, except that, with  respect to data qualifying and submitted as limited rights technical  data,   the Government shall have the rights specified in the contract  modification implementing the VECP and shall appropriately mark the  data. (The terms unlimited rights and limited rights are defined in part  27 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.)</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p><p class="depth2">Alterate I (APR 1984). When the head of the contracting activity  determines that the cost of calculating and tracking collateral savings  will exceed the benefits to be derived in a construction contract,  delete paragraph (g) from the basic clause and redesignate the remaining  paragraphs accordingly.  [48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 54 FR 5059, Jan. 31, 1989;  64 FR 72449, Dec. 27, 1999; 71 FR 57369, Sept. 28, 2006;75 FR 53135,  Aug. 30, 2010; 80 FR 38301, July 2, 2015]</p>
