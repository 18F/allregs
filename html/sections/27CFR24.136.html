                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Wine premises, or parts thereof, may be operated  alternately by proprietors who have each filed and received approval of  the necessary applications and bonds and have qualified under the  provisions of this part. Where operations by alternating proprietors are  limited to parts of the wine premises, the application will describe  areas, buildings, floors, or rooms which will be alternated and will be  accompanied by a diagram delineating the parts of the wine premises to  be alternated. A separate diagram will be submitted to depict each  arrangement under which the wine premises will be operated. Once the  qualifying documents have been approved, and operations initiated, the  wine premises, or parts thereof, may be alternated. Any transfer of  wine, spirits, or other accountable materials from one proprietor to the  other proprietor will be indicated in the records and reports of each  proprietor. Operation of a bonded winery engaged in the production of  wine by an alternate proprietor will be at least one calendar day in  length.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alternation. All operations in any area, building, floor, or  room to be alternated will be completely finished and all wine, spirits,  and other accountable materials will be removed from the alternated wine  premises or transferred to the incoming proprietor.   However, wine, spirits, and other accountable materials may be retained  in locked tanks at wine premises to be alternated and remain in the  custody of the outgoing proprietor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bonds. The outgoing proprietor who has filed bond and intends to  resume operation of the alternated areas, buildings, floors, or rooms  following suspension of operations by an alternating proprietor shall  execute a consent of surety to continue in effect all bonds. Where wine,  spirits, or other accountable materials subject to tax under 26 U.S.C.  chapter 51 are to be retained in tanks on the wine premises to be  alternated, the outgoing proprietor shall also execute a consent of  surety to continue the liability of all bonds for the tax on the  materials, notwithstanding the change in proprietorship.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Records. Each proprietor shall maintain separate records and  submit a separate TTB F 5120.17, Report of Bonded Wine Premises  Operations. All transfers of wine, spirits, and other accountable  materials will be reflected in the records of each proprietor. Each  proprietor shall maintain a record showing the name and registry number  of the incoming or outgoing proprietor, the effective date and hour of  alternation, and the quantity in gallons and the percent alcohol by  volume or proof of any wine, spirits, or other accountable materials  transferred or received.
