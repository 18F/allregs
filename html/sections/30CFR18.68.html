                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tests for intrinsic safety will be conducted under the general  concepts of ``intrinsically safe'' as defined in Subpart A of this part.  Further tests or requirements may be added at any time if features of  construction or use or both indicate them to be necessary. Some tests  included in these requirements may be omitted on the basis of previous  experience.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intrinsically safe circuits and/or components will be subjected  to tests consisting of making and breaking the intrinsically safe  circuit under conditions judged to simulate the most hazardous probable  faults or malfunctions. Tests will be made in the most easily ignitable  mixture of methane or natural gas and air. The method of making and  breaking the circuit may be varied to meet a particular condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Those components which affect intrinsic safety must meet the  following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Current limiting components shall consist of two equivalent  devices each of which singly will provide intrinsic safety. They shall  not be operated at more than 50 percent of their ratings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Components of reliable construction shall be used and they  shall be so mounted as to provide protection against shock and vibration  in normal use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Semiconductors shall be amply sized. Rectifiers and  transistors shall be operated at not more than two-thirds of their rated  current and permissible peak inverse voltage. Zener diodes shall be  operated at not more than one-half of their rated current and shall  short under abnormal conditions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Electrolytic capacitors shall be operated at not more than two- thirds of their rated voltage. They shall be designed to withstand a  test voltage of 1,500 volts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Intrinsically safe circuits shall be so designed that after  failure of a single component, and subsequent failures resulting from  this first failure, the circuit will remain intrinsically safe.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The circuit will be considered as intrinsically safe if in the  course of testing no ignitions occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Complete intrinsically safe equipment powered by low energy  batteries:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Short-circuit tests shall be conducted on batteries at normal  operating temperature. Tests may be made on batteries at elevated  temperature if such tests are deemed necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Resistance devices for limiting short-circuit current shall be  an integral part of the battery, or installed as close to the battery  terminal as practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transistors of battery-operated equipment may be subjected to  thermal ``run-away'' tests to determine that they will not ignite an  explosive atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A minimum of 1,000 make-break sparks will be produced in each  test for   direct current circuits with consideration given to reversed polarity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Tests on batteries shall include series and/or parallel  combinations of twice the normal battery complement, and the effect of  capacitance and inductance, added to that normally present in the  circuit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> No ignition shall occur when approximately \1/2\-inch of a  single wire strand representative of the wire used in the equipment or  device is shorted across the intrinsically safe circuit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Consideration shall be given to insure against accidental  reversal of polarity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Line-powered equipment and devices:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Line-powered equipment shall meet all applicable provisions  specified for battery-powered equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nonintrinsically safe components supplying power for  intrinsically safe circuits shall be housed in explosion-proof  enclosures and be provided with energy limiting components in the  enclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Wiring for nonintrinsically safe circuits shall not be  intermingled with wiring for intrinsically safe circuits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transformers that supply power for intrinsically safe circuits  shall have the primary and secondary windings physically separated. They  shall be designed to withstand a test voltage of 1,500 volts when rated  125 volts or less and 2,500 volts when rated more than 125 volts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The line voltage shall be increased to 120 percent of nominal  rated voltage to cover power line voltage variations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In investigations of alternating current circuits a minimum of  5,000 make-break sparks will be produced in each test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The design of intrinsically safe circuits shall preclude  extraneous voltages caused by insufficient isolation or inductive  coupling. The investigation shall determine the effect of ground faults  where applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Identification markings: Circuits and components of  intrinsically safe equipment and devices shall be adequately identified  by marking or labeling. Battery-powered equipment shall be marked to  indicate the manufacturer, type designation, ratings, and size of  batteries used.</p>
