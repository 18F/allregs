                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Observer coverage requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Harvesting vessels. When  NMFS notifies the owner, operator, permit holder, or the manager of a  harvesting vessel of any requirement to carry an observer,   the harvesting vessel may not be used to fish for groundfish without  carrying an observer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Processing vessels. Unless specified otherwise by the Observer  Program, any vessel 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or longer that is engaged in at- sea processing must carry two certified observers procured from a  permitted observer provider, and any vessel shorter than 125 ft (38.1 m)  LOA that is engaged in at-sea processing must carry one certified  observer procured from a permitted observer provider, each day that the  vessel is used to take, retain, receive, land, process, or transport  groundfish. Owners of vessels required to carry observers under this  paragraph must arrange for observer services from a permitted observer  provider except when the Observer Program has determined and given  notification that the vessel must carry NMFS staff or an individual  authorized by NMFS in addition to or in lieu of an observer provided by  a permitted observer provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of departure--basic rule. At least 24 hours (but not more  than 36 hours) before departing on a fishing trip, a harvesting vessel  that has been notified by NMFS that it is required to carry an observer,  or that is operating in an active sampling unit, must notify NMFS (or  its designated agent) of the vessel's intended time of departure. Notice  will be given in a form to be specified by NMFS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Optional notice--weather delays. A harvesting vessel that  anticipates a delayed departure due to weather or sea conditions may  advise NMFS of the anticipated delay when providing the basic notice  described in paragraph (b) of this section. If departure is delayed  beyond 36 hours from the time the original notice is given, the vessel  must provide an additional notice of departure not less than four hours  prior to departure, in order to enable NMFS to place an observer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Optional notice--back-to-back fishing trips. A harvesting vessel  that intends to make back-to-back fishing trips (i.e., trips with less  than 24 hours between offloading from one trip and beginning another),  may provide the basic notice described in paragraph (b) of this section  for both trips, prior to making the first trip. A vessel that has given  such notice is not required to give additional notice of the second  trip.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cease fishing report. Within 24 hours of ceasing the taking and  retaining of groundfish, vessel owners, operators, or managers must  notify NMFS or its designated agent that fishing has ceased. This  requirement applies to any harvesting or processing vessel that is  required to carry an observer, or that is operating in a segment of the  fleet that NMFS has identified as an active sampling unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waiver. The West Coast Regional Administrator (or designate) may  provide written notification to the vessel owner stating that a  determination has been made to temporarily waive coverage requirements  because of circumstances that are deemed to be beyond the vessel's  control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Vessel responsibilities--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accommodations and food. An  operator of a vessel required to carry one or more observer(s) must  provide accommodations and food that are Equivalent to those provided to  the crew.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Safe conditions. Maintain safe conditions on the vessel for the  protection of observer(s) including adherence to all USCG and other  applicable rules, regulations, or statutes pertaining to safe operation  of the vessel, and provisions at Sec. Sec. 600.725 and 600.746 of this  chapter. Have on board a valid Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Decal  that certifies compliance with regulations found in 33 CFR chapter I and  46 CFR chapter I, a certificate of compliance issued pursuant to 46 CFR  28.710 or a valid certificate of inspection pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 3311.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Observer communications. Facilitate observer communications by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Observer use of equipment. Allowing observer(s) to use the  vessel's communication equipment and personnel, on request, for the  entry, transmission, and receipt of work-related messages, at no cost to  the observer(s), observer provider or NMFS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Functional equipment. Ensuring that the vessel's communications  equipment, used by observers to enter and transmit data, is fully  functional and operational.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Vessel position. Allow observer(s) access to, and the use of,  the vessel's   navigation equipment and personnel, on request, to determine the  vessel's position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Access. Allow observer(s) free and unobstructed access to the  vessel's bridge, trawl or working decks, holding bins, processing areas,  freezer spaces, weight scales, cargo holds, and any other space that may  be used to hold, process, weigh, or store fish or fish products at any  time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Prior notification. Notify observer(s) at least 15 minutes  before fish are brought on board, or fish and fish products are  transferred from the vessel, to allow sampling the catch or observing  the transfer, unless the observer specifically requests not to be  notified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Records. Allow observer(s) to inspect and copy any state or  Federal logbook maintained voluntarily or as required by regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Assistance. Provide all other reasonable assistance to enable  observer(s) to carry out their duties, including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Measuring decks, codends, and holding bins.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Providing the observer(s) with a safe work area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Collecting bycatch when requested by the observer(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Collecting and carrying baskets of fish when requested by the  observer(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Allowing the observer(s) to collect biological data and samples.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Providing adequate space for storage of biological samples.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Observer sampling station. This paragraph contains the  requirements for observer sampling stations. The vessel owner must  provide an observer sampling station that complies with this section so  that the observer can carry out required duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accessibility. The observer sampling station must be available  to the observer at all times.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Location. The observer sampling station must be located within  four meters of the location from which the observer samples unsorted  catch. Unobstructed passage must be provided between the observer  sampling station and the location where the observer collects sample  catch.
