and to submit supporting documentation by an official authorized to act on behalf of the entity, under penalty of perjury. The following are examples of documentation that may be acceptable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A copy of the employer's plan or policy that specifies the services covered, conditions of coverage, benefit levels and limitations with respect to persons entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD, age, or disability as compared to the provisions applicable to other enrollees and potential enrollees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An explanation of the plan's allegation that it does not owe CMS any amount CMS claims the plan owes as repayment for conditional or mistaken Medicare primary payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lack of acceptable documentation. If a GHP or LGHP fails to provide acceptable evidence or documentation that it has complied with the MSP prohibitions and requirements set forth in Sec. 411.110, CMS may make a determination of nonconformance for both the year in which the services were furnished and the year in which the request for information was made.</p>
