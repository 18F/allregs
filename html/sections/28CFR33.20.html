Each state shall distribute to its local units of  government, in the aggregate, a portion of the state's block grant funds  equal to the local government share of total state and local criminal  justice expenditures. Section 407(b) of the Act. In determining the  portion to be distributed to local units, the most recent and complete  data available from the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the U.S.  Department of Justice shall be used unless the use of other data has  been approved in advance by the Bureau of Justice Assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To request approval of a distribution ratio other than that  based on data of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the head of the State  Office must certify in writing to the Bureau of Justice Assistance that  the ratio it proposes is a correct reflection of the local share of  total state and local criminal justice expenditures and that the state  has notified its major local governments of the request and informed  them of the opportunity to contact the Bureau within 30 days, if they  have any objections. The written request must also cite the expenditure  data used to substantiate the proposed change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allocation based on greatest need. In distributing funds among  urban, rural, and suburban units of local government, the state shall  give priority to those jurisdictions with the greatest need. Section  407(b)(2) of the Act.</p>
