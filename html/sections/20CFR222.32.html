                            <p class="depth0">A claimant will be considered the natural child of the employee for  both annuity and lump-sum payment purposes if one of the following sets  of conditions is met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State inheritance law. Under relevant state inheritance law, the  claimant could inherit a share of the employee's personal estate as the  employee's natural child if the employee were to die without leaving a  will as described in paragraph (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Natural child. The claimant is the employee's natural son or  daughter, and the employee and the claimant's mother or father went  through a marriage ceremony which would have been valid except for a  legal impediment;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> By order of law. The claimant's natural mother or father has not  married the employee, but--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee has acknowledged in writing that the claimant is  his or her son or daughter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A court has decreed that the employee is the mother or father of  the claimant; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A court has ordered the employee to contribute to the claimant's  support because the claimant is the employee's son or daughter; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Such acknowledgment, court decree, or court order was made not  less than one year before the employee became entitled to an annuity, or  in the case of a disability annuitant prior to his or her most recent  period of disability, or in case the employee is deceased, prior to his  or her death. The written acknowledgment, court decree, or court order  will be considered to have occurred on the first day of the month in  which it actually occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other evidence of relationship. The claimant's natural mother or  father has not married the employee, but--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The claimant has submitted evidence acceptable in the judgment  of the Board, other than that discussed in paragraph (c) of this  section, that the employee is his or her natural mother or father; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee was living with the claimant or contributing to the  claimant's support, as discussed in Sec. Sec. 222.58 and 222.42 of this  part, when--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The spouse applied for an annuity based on having the employee's  child in care; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employee's annuity could have been increased under the  social security overall minimum provision; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The employee died, if the claimant is applying for a child's  annuity or lump-sum payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use of state laws--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. To determine whether a claimant  is the natural child of the employee, the state inheritance laws  regarding whether the claimant could inherit a child's share of the  employee's personal property if he or she were to die intestate will  apply. If such laws would permit the claimant to inherit the employee's  personal property, the claimant will be considered the child of the  employee. The state inheritance laws where the employee was domiciled  when he or she died will apply. If the employee's domicile was not in  one of the 50 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin  slands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands, the laws  of the District of Columbia will apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Standards. The Board will not apply any state inheritance law  requirement that an action to establish paternity must have been  commenced within a specific time period, measured from the employee's  death or the child's birth, or that an action to establish paternity  must have been commenced or completed before the employee's death. If  state laws on inheritance require a court to determine paternity, the  Board will not require such a determination, but the Board will decide  paternity using the standard of proof that the state court would apply  as the basis for making such a determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employee is living. If the employee is living, the Board will  apply the state law where the employee is domiciled which was in effect  when the annuity may first be increased under the social security  overall minimum (see part 229 of this chapter). If under a version of  state law in effect at that time, a person does not qualify as a child  of the employee, the Board will look to all versions of state law in  effect from when the employee's annuity may first have been increased  until the Board makes a final decision, and will apply the version of  state law most favorable to the employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Employee is deceased. The Board will apply the state law where  the employee was domiciled when he or she died. The Board will apply the  version of state law in effect at the time of the final decision on the  application for benefits. If under that version of state law the  claimant does not qualify as the child of the employee, the Board will  apply the state law in effect when the employee died, or any version of  state law in effect from the month of potential entitlement to benefits  until a final determination on the application. The Board will apply the  version most beneficial to the claimant. The following rules determine  the law in effect as of the employee's death:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any law enacted after the employee's death, if that law would  have retroactive application to the employee's date of death, will  apply; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any law that supersedes a law declared unconstitutional, that  was considered constitutional on the employee's date of death, will  apply.
