                            <p class="depth0">Upon determination that an overpayment has been made, adjustments will be made against monthly benefits and lump sums as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individual overpaid is living. (1) If the individual to whom an overpayment was made is at the time of a determination of such overpayment entitled to a monthly benefit or a lump sum under title II of the Act, or at any time thereafter becomes so entitled, no benefit for any month and no lump sum is payable to such individual, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, until an amount equal to the amount of the overpayment has been withheld or refunded. Such adjustments will be made against any monthly benefit or lump sum under

title II of the Act to which such individual is entitled whether payable on the basis of such individual's earnings or the earnings of another individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the individual to whom an overpayment was made is at the time of a determination of such overpayment entitled to a monthly benefit or a lump sum under title II of the Act, or at any time thereafter becomes so entitled, no benefit for any month and no lump sum is payable to such individual, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, until an amount equal to the amount of the overpayment has been withheld or refunded. Such adjustments will be made against any monthly benefit or lump sum under

title II of the Act to which such individual is entitled whether payable on the basis of such individual's earnings or the earnings of another individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If any other individual is entitled to benefits for any month on the basis of the same earnings as the overpaid individual, except as adjustment is to be effected pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section by withholding a part of the monthly benefit of either the overpaid individual or any other individual entitled to benefits on the basis of the same earnings, no benefit for any month will be paid on such earnings to such other individual until an amount equal to the amount of the overpayment has been withheld or refunded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a representative payee receives a payment on behalf of a beneficiary after that beneficiary dies, the representative payee or his estate is solely liable for repaying the overpayment. If the representative payee is entitled to a monthly benefit or a lump sum under title II of the Act at the time we determine that an overpayment exists or at any time thereafter, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, we will not pay the monthly benefits or the lump sum to the representative payee until the amount of the overpayment has been repaid. We will make such adjustments against any monthly benefit or lump sum under title II of the Act to which the representative payee is entitled whether payable on the basis of such representative payee's earnings or the earnings of another individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Individual overpaid dies before adjustment. If an overpaid individual dies before adjustment is completed under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, no lump sum and no subsequent monthly benefit will be paid on the basis of earnings which were the basis of the overpayment to such deceased individual until full recovery of the overpayment has been effected, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section or under Sec. 404.515. Such recovery may be effected through:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Payment by the estate of the deceased overpaid individual,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Withholding of amounts due the estate of such individual under title II of the Act,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Withholding a lump sum or monthly benefits due any other individual on the basis of the same earnings which were the basis of the overpayment to the deceased overpaid individual, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any combination of the amount above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The methods in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section for overpayments owed by a representative payee for payments made after the beneficiary's death. We will not recover such overpayments from any person other than the individual who was representative payee or his estate, but we may recover these overpayments from such other person under Sec. 404.503(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjustment by withholding part of a monthly benefit. (1) Where it is determined that withholding the full amount each month would defeat the purpose of title II, i.e., deprive the person of income required for ordinary and necessary living expenses (see Sec. 404.508), adjustment under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be effected by withholding an amount of not less than $10 of the monthly benefit payable to an individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where it is determined that withholding the full amount each month would defeat the purpose of title II, i.e., deprive the person of income required for ordinary and necessary living expenses (see Sec. 404.508), adjustment under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be effected by withholding an amount of not less than $10 of the monthly benefit payable to an individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjustment as provided by this paragraph will not be available if the overpayment was caused by the individual's intentional false statement or representation, or willful concealment of, or deliberate failure to furnish, material information. In such cases, recovery of the overpayment will be accomplished as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Individual overpaid enrolled under supplementary insurance plan. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, if the individual liable for the overpayment is an enrollee under part B of title XVIII of the Act and the overpayment was not caused by such individual's intentional false statement or representation, or willful concealment of, or deliberate failure to furnish, material information, an amount of such individual's monthly benefit which is equal to

his obligation for supplementary medical insurance premiums will be applied toward payment of such premiums, and the balance of the monthly benefit will be applied toward recovery of the overpayment. Further adjustment with respect to such balance may be made if the enrollee so requests and meets the conditions of paragraph (c) of this section.

Sec. 404.502a  Notice of right to waiver consideration.</p><p class="depth0">Whenever an initial determination is made that more than the correct amount of payment has been made, and we seek adjustment or recovery of the overpayment, the individual from whom we are seeking adjustment or recovery is immediately notified. The notice includes:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The overpayment amount and how and when it occurred;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request for full, immediate refund, unless the overpayment can be withheld from the next month's benefit;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The proposed adjustment of benefits if refund is not received within 30 days after the date of the notice and adjustment of benefits is available;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An explanation of the availability of a different rate of withholding when full withholding is proposed, installment payments when refund is requested and adjustment is not currently available, and/or cross-program recovery when refund is requested and the individual is receiving another type of payment from SSA (language about cross-program recovery is not included in notices sent to individuals in jurisdictions where this recovery option is not available);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An explanation of the right to request waiver of adjustment or recovery and the automatic scheduling of a file review and pre-recoupment hearing (commonly referred to as a personal conference) if a request for waiver cannot be approved after initial paper review;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An explanation of the right to request reconsideration of the fact and/or amount of the overpayment determination;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Instructions about the availability of forms for requesting reconsideration and waiver;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> An explanation that if the individual does not request waiver or reconsideration within 30 days of the date of the overpayment notice, adjustment or recovery of the overpayment will begin;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> A statement that an SSA office will help the individual complete and submit forms for appeal or waiver requests; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A statement that the individual receiving the notice should notify SSA promptly if reconsideration, waiver, a lesser rate of withholding, repayment by installments or cross-program adjustment is wanted.
