An EIS is intended to provide a full, open, and  balanced discussion of significant environmental impacts that   may result from a proposed action and alternatives, allowing public  review and comment on the proposal and providing a basis for informed  decision-making.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The NEPA process should support sound, informed, and timely  (early) decision-making; not produce encyclopedic documents. CEQ  guidance (40 CFR 1502.7) should be followed, establishing a page limit  of 150 pages (300 pages for complex projects). To the extent  practicable, EISs will ``incorporate by reference'' any material that is  reasonably available for inspection by potentially interested persons  within the time allowed for comment. The incorporated material shall be  cited in the EIS and its content will be briefly described. Material  based on proprietary data, that is itself not available for review and  comment, shall not be incorporated by reference.</p>
