                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Making recommendations in official capacity. In general, an  employee shall not, in the employee's official capacity, make any  recommendations in connection with the employment of persons unless the  position concerned are with the Government of the United States and the  recommendations are made in response to an inquiry from a Government  official authorized to employ persons or to investigate applicants for  employment. A principal officer in answer to a letter of inquiry from  outside the U.S. Government concerning a former employee assigned to the  post, may state the length of time the person was employed at the post  and the fact that the former employee performed duties in a satisfactory  manner, if such is the case. Also, an AID Mission Director may provide  names of persons or firms from which a cooperating government may select  an employee or firm to be used in some phase of the AID program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b))</em>: Provided, That the employee does not  divulge any information concerning the person derived from official  sources. When a letter of introduction or recommendation is written by  an employee, precautionary measures should be taken to prevent its being  construed as official correspondence and used by an unscrupulous  individual to impress American or foreign officials. Accordingly,  official stationery should not be used for this purpose. The letter may,  however, show the recommending employee's status as an employee of the  U. S. Government. Every personal letter of recommendation shall contain  a statement clearly indicating that the letter constitutes a personal  recommendation and is not to be construed as an official recommendation  by the Government of the United States.</p>
