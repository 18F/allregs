                            <p class="depth0">In the context of the review function prescribed by 10 U.S.C. 1553, a discharge or dismissal is a complete separation from the Naval Service, other than one pursuant to the sentence of a general court-martial. By reason of usage, the term ``discharge'' is predominantly applicable to the separation of enlisted personnel for any reason, and the term ``dismissal'' to the separation of officers as a result of Secretarial or general court-martial action. In the context of the mission of the NDRB, the term ``discharge'' used here shall, for purpose of ease of expression, include any complete separation from the naval service other than that pursuant to the sentence of general court-martial. The term ``discharge'' also includes the type of discharge and the reason/basis for that discharge, e.g., Other Than Honorable/Misconduct (Civil Conviction).</p>
