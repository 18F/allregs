                            <p class="depth0">When this section is referenced for a Hazard Zone A or B hazardous  material elsewhere in this subchapter, the requirements in this section  are applicable to cylinders used for that material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authorized cylinders. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A cylinder must conform to a DOT  specification or a UN standard prescribed in subpart C of part 178 of  this subchapter, except that acetylene cylinders and non-refillable  cylinders are not authorized. The use of UN tubes and MEGCs is  prohibited for Hazard Zone A materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The use of a specification 3AL cylinder made of aluminum alloy  6351-T6 is prohibited for a Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A material or a  Division 6.1 Hazard Zone A material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A UN composite cylinder certified to ISO-11119-3 is not  authorized for a Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A or B material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For UN seamless cylinders used for Hazard Zone A materials, the  maximum water capacity is 85 L.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Outage and pressure requirements. For DOT specification  cylinders, the pressure at 55 C (131 F) of Hazard Zone A and Hazard  Zone B materials may not exceed the service pressure of the cylinder.  Sufficient outage must be provided so that the cylinder will not be  liquid full at 55 C (131 F).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Closures. Each cylinder containing a Hazard Zone A material must  be closed with a plug or valve conforming to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each plug or valve must have a taper-threaded connection  directly to the cylinder and be capable of withstanding the test  pressure of the cylinder without damage or leakage. For UN pressure  receptacles, each valve must be capable of withstanding the test  pressure of the pressure receptacle and be connected directly to the  pressure receptacle by either a taper thread or other means which meets  the requirements of ISO 10692-2: (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this  subchapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each valve must be of the packless type with non-perforated  diaphragm, except that, for corrosive materials, a valve may be of the  packed type with an assembly made gas-tight by means of a seal cap with  gasketed joint attached to the valve body or the cylinder to prevent  loss of material through or past the packing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each valve outlet must be sealed by a threaded cap or threaded  solid plug and inert gasketing material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The materials of construction for the cylinder, valves, plugs,  outlet caps, luting, and gaskets must be compatible with each other and  with the lading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional handling protection. Each cylinder or cylinder  overpack combination offered for transportation containing a Division  2.3 or 6.1 Hazard Zone A or B material must conform to the valve damage  protection performance requirements of this section. In addition to the  requirements of this section, overpacks must conform to the overpack  provisions of Sec. 173.25.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DOT specification cylinders must conform to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each cylinder with a wall thickness at any point of less than  2.03 mm (0.08 inch) and each cylinder that does not have fitted valve  protection must be overpacked in a box. The box must conform to overpack  provisions in Sec. 173.25. Box and valve protection must be of  sufficient strength to protect all parts of the cylinder and valve, if  any, from deformation and breakage resulting from a drop of 2.0 m (7 ft)  or more   onto a non-yielding surface, such as concrete or steel, impacting at an  orientation most likely to cause damage. ``Deformation''means a cylinder  or valve that is bent, distorted, mangled, misshapen, twisted, warped,  or in a similar condition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each cylinder with a valve must be equipped with a protective  metal cap, other valve protection device, or an overpack which is  sufficient to protect the valve from breakage or leakage resulting from  a drop of 2.0 m (7 ft) onto a non-yielding surface, such as concrete or  steel. Impact must be at an orientation most likely to cause damage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each UN cylinder containing a Hazard Zone A or Hazard Zone B  material must have a minimum test pressure in accordance with P200 of  the UN Recommendations (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). For  Hazard Zone A gases, the cylinder must have a minimum wall thickness of  3.5 mm if made of aluminum alloy or 2 mm if made of steel or,  alternatively, cylinders may be packed in a rigid outer packaging that  meets the Packing Group I performance level when tested as prepared for  transport, and that is designed and constructed to protect the cylinder  and valve from puncture or damage that may result in release of the gas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Interconnection. Cylinders may not be manifolded or connected.  This provision does not apply to MEGCs containing Hazard Zone B  materials in accordance with Sec. 173.312.
