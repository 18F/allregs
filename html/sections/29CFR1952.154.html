                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with section 18(e) of the Act and procedures in 29 CFR part 1902, and after determination that the State met the ``fully effective'' compliance staffing benchmarks as revised in 1984 and 1996 in response to a court order in AFL-CIO v. Marshall, 570 F.2d 1030 (D.C. Cir. 1978), and was satisfactorily providing reports to OSHA through participation in the Federal-State Integrated Management Information System, the Assistant Secretary evaluated actual operations under the North Carolina State plan for a period of at least one year following certification of completion of developmental steps (41 FR 43896). Based on the Biennial Evaluation Report covering the period of October 1, 1993, through September 30, 1995, an 18(e) Evaluation Report covering the period October 1, 1995, through June 30, 1996, and after opportunity for public comment, the Assistant Secretary determined that in

operation the State of North Carolina's occupational safety and health program is at least as effective as the Federal program in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment and meets the criteria for final State plan approval in section 18(e) of the Act and implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 1902. Accordingly, the North Carolina plan was granted final approval and concurrent Federal enforcement authority was relinquished under section 18(e) of the Act effective December 10, 1996.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as otherwise noted, the plan which has received final approval covers all activities of employers and all places of employment in North Carolina. The plan does not cover Federal government employers and employees; the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), including USPS employees, and contract employees and contractor-operated facilities engaged in USPS mail operations; the American National Red Cross; private sector maritime activities; employment on Indian reservations; enforcement relating to any contractors or subcontractors on any Federal establishment where the land has been ceded to the Federal Government; railroad employment; and enforcement on military bases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> North Carolina is required to maintain a State program which is at least as effective as operations under the Federal program; to submit plan supplements in accordance with 29 CFR part 1953; to allocate sufficient safety and health enforcement staff to meet the benchmarks for State staffing established by the U.S. Department of Labor, or any revisions to those benchmarks; and, to furnish such reports in such form as the Assistant Secretary may from time to time require.
[61 FR 66601, Dec. 18, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 36621, June 9, 2000; 65 FR 62612, Oct. 19, 2000]</p>
