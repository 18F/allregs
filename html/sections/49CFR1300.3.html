                            <p class="depth0">Where a shipper or a prospective shipper or person acting on behalf  of a shipper or a prospective shipper requests that the carrier  establish a rate in the absence of an existing rate for particular  transportation, the carrier must promptly establish and provide to the  requester a rate and applicable service terms. The information may be  provided either in written or electronic form, as agreed to by the  parties. If the parties cannot agree, such information is to be provided  in electronic (non-passive) form where both parties have the requisite  capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing. The response   should be provided as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10  business days from receipt of the request. If a carrier determines that  additional information is required from the requester before a rate or  term can be established, the carrier must so notify the requester as  soon as possible, but no later than 10 business days after receipt of  the request. Once the additional information is received, the carrier  must set the rate and related service terms, and relay them to the  requester, as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 business  days from the receipt of the additional information. (However, the  parties may agree to a different time period, in which case these time  periods would not apply.) A rail carrier may, at its option, require  that requests submitted under this section be in written or electronic  form, although the carrier may permit oral requests.</p>
