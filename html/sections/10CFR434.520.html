The Design Energy Consumption may be based on an assumed  adjusted lighting power for future lighting improvements.</p><p class="depth0">520.2 The assumption about future lighting power used to calculate  the Design Energy Consumption must be documented so that the future  installed lighting systems may be in compliance with these standards.  Documentation must be provided to enable future lighting systems to use  either the Prescriptive method or the Systems Performance method of  subsection 401.3.</p><p class="depth0">520.3 Documentation for future lighting systems that use subsection  401.3 shall be stated as a maximum adjusted lighting power for the  tenant spaces. The adjusted lighting power allowance for tenant spaces  shall account for the lighting power provided for the common areas of  the building.</p><p class="depth0">520.4 Documentation for future lighting systems that use subsection  401.3 shall be stated as a required lighting adjustment. The required  lighting adjustment is the whole building lighting power assumed in  order to calculate the Design Energy Consumption minus the ILPA value  from Table 401.3.2c that was used to calculate the Energy Cost Budget.  When the required lighting adjustment is less than zero, a complete  lighting design must be developed for one or more representative tenant  spaces, demonstrating acceptable lighting within the limits of the  assumed lighting power allowance.</p><p class="depth0">520.5 HVAC Systems and Equipment. If the HVAC system is not  completely specified in the plans, the Design Energy Consumption shall  be based on reasonable assumptions about the construction of future HVAC  systems and equipment. These assumptions shall be documented so that  future HVAC systems and equipment may be in compliance with these  standards.</p>
