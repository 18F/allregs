                                Sec. 13.16  Liquidation of collateral.

                            <p class="depth0">Where the Administrator holds a security instrument with a power of  sale or has physical possession of collateral, he may liquidate the  security or collateral and apply the proceeds to the overdue debt. EPA  will exercise this right where the debtor fails to pay within a  reasonable time after demand, unless the cost of disposing of the  collateral is disproportionate to its value or special circumstances  require judicial foreclosure. However, collection from other businesses,  including liquidation of security or collateral, is not a prerequisite  to requiring payment by a surety or insurance company unless expressly  required by contract or statute. The Administrator will give the debtor  reasonable notice of the sale and an accounting of any surplus proceeds  and will comply with any other requirements of law or contract.</p>
