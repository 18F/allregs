                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever an overpayment is made under an Indian oil and gas  lease, a payor may recoup the overpayment through a recoupment on Form  ONRR-2014 against the current month's royalties or other revenues owed  on the same lease. However, for any month a payor may not recoup more  than 50 percent of the royalties or other revenues owed in that month  under an individual allotted lease or more than 100 percent of the  royalties or other revenues owed in that month under a tribal lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With written permission authorized by tribal statute or  resolution, a payor may recoup an overpayment against royalties or other  revenues owed in that month under other leases for which that tribe is  the lessor. A copy of the tribe's written permission must be furnished  to ONRR pursuant to instructions for reporting recoupments in the ONRR  revenue reporter handbook. See part 1210 of this chapter. Recouping  overpayments on one allotted lease from royalties paid to another  allotted lease is specifically prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Overpayments subject to recoupment under this section include  all payments made in excess of the required payment for royalty, rental,  bonus, or other amounts owed as specified by statute, regulation, order,  or terms of an Indian mineral lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The ONRR Director or his/her designee may order any payor to not  recoup any amount for such reasonable period of time as may be necessary  for ONRR to review the nature and amount of any claimed overpayment.  [60 FR 3087, Jan. 13, 1995, as amended at 67 FR 19112, Apr. 18, 2002]</p>
