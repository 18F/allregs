The term  financial interest is defined in Sec. 2635.403(c) of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> and  that, in the mind of a reasonable person with knowledge of the  particular circumstances, the financial interest will not create an  appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or call into  question the impartiality and objectivity with which TTB's programs are  administered.
