This computation will be based on the arithmetic mean wage of all workers in the occupation.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> In geographic areas where the OES does not gather wage data, including but not limited to the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and there is no CBA, DBA, or SCA wage available for the job opportunity, the NPC will consider wage information in the form of a wage survey provided by an employer in making a prevailing wage determination. Such a survey may only be submitted with a request for a prevailing wage determination. A request filed under this paragraph does not need to be preceded by a request and approval to submit wage information as described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)(i)</em> An employer may submit a written request to the Administrator, OFLC to provide a private wage survey for OFLC to consider in making a prevailing wage determination which must demonstrate that the following factors are present:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An employer may submit a written request to the Administrator, OFLC to provide a private wage survey for OFLC to consider in making a prevailing wage determination which must demonstrate that the following factors are present:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> There is no CBA, DBA, or SCA wage available for the job opportunity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The job opportunity was not listed in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) and is not listed in the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system, or if the job opportunity was listed in the DOT or is listed in the SOC system, the DOT crosswalk to the SOC system links to an occupational classification signifying a generalized set of occupations as ``all other''; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The job description entails job duties which require knowledge, skills, abilities, and work tasks that are significantly different, as defined in guidance to be issued by the OFLC, than those in any other SOC occupation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator, OFLC may approve or deny an employer's written request to

provide a wage survey. If the Administrator, OFLC approves the employer's written request, the Administrator, OFLC will send an approval letter to the employer. Approvals shall be valid for 1 year from the date of approval and only for the job opportunity and area of intended employment specified in the original written request. This approval does not constitute an acceptance of any particular wage survey.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If approval is granted, the employer may submit a request for a prevailing wage determination to the NPC along with a copy of the Administrator, OFLC's approval letter and a complete copy of the private survey.
