                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prepaid subscription income. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``prepaid subscription  income'' means any amount includible in gross income which is received  in connection with, and is directly attributable to, a liability of the  taxpayer which extends beyond the close of the taxable year in which  such amount is received and which is income from a newspaper, magazine,  or other periodical. For example where Corporation X, a publisher of  newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals makes sales on a  subscription basis and the purchaser pays the subscription price in  advance, prepaid subscription income would include the amounts actually  received by X in connection with its liability to furnish or deliver the  newspaper, magazine, or other periodical.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of section 455, prepaid subscription income does  not include amounts received by a taxpayer in connection with sales of  subscriptions on a prepaid basis where such taxpayer does not have the  liability to furnish or deliver a newspaper, magazine, or other  periodical. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by  the following example. Corporation D has a contract with each of several  large publishers which grants it the right to sell subscriptions to  their periodicals. Corporation D collects the subscription price from  the subscribers, retains a portion thereof as its commission and remits  the balance to the publishers. The amount retained by Corporation D  represents commissions on the sale of subscriptions, and is not prepaid  subscription income for purposes of section 455 since the commissions  represent compensation for services rendered and are not directly  attributable to a liability of Corporation D to furnish or deliver a  newspaper, magazine, or other periodical.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Liability. The term ``liability'' means a liability of the  taxpayer to furnish or deliver a newspaper, magazine, or other  periodical.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Receipt of prepaid subscription income. For purposes of section  455, prepaid subscription income shall be treated as received during the  taxable year for which it is includible in gross income under section  451, relating to general rule for taxable year of inclusion, without  regard to section 455.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Treatment of prepaid subscription income under an established  accounting method. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 455 and  Sec. 1.455-1, any taxpayer who, for taxable years beginning before  January 1, 1958, has reported prepaid subscription income for income tax  purposes under an established and consistent method or practice of  deferring such income may continue to report such income in accordance  with such method or practice for all subsequent taxable years to which  section 455 applies without making an election under section 455.
