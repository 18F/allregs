                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All witnesses compelled by subpoena to submit to CSB depositions  shall be sequestered unless the official conducting the depositions  permits otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any witness compelled by subpoena to appear at a deposition  during a CSB investigation may be accompanied, represented, and advised  by an attorney in good standing of his or her choice, pursuant to Sec.   1610.1. However, when the CSB official conducting the investigation  determines, after consultation with the Office of General Counsel, that  the CSB has concrete evidence that the presence of an attorney  representing multiple interests would obstruct and impede the  investigation or inspection, the CSB official may prohibit that counsel  from being present during the deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The deposing official is to provide a witness whose counsel has  been excluded under paragraph (b) of this section, and the witness'  counsel, a written statement of the reasons supporting the decision to  exclude. This statement, which must be provided no later than five  working days after exclusion, must explain the basis for the counsel's  exclusion. This statement must also advise the witness of the witness'  right to appeal the exclusion decision and obtain an automatic stay of  the effectiveness of the subpoena by filing a motion to quash the  subpoena with the Board within five days of receipt of this written  statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within five days after receipt of the written notification  required in paragraph (c) of this section, a witness whose counsel has  been excluded may appeal the exclusion decision by filing a motion to  quash the subpoena with the Board. The filing of the motion to quash  will stay the effectiveness of the subpoena pending the Board's decision  on the motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a witness' counsel is excluded under paragraph (b) of this  section, the deposition may, at the witness' request, either proceed  without counsel or be delayed for a reasonable period of time to permit  the retention of new counsel. The deposition may also be rescheduled to  a subsequent date established by the CSB, although the deposition shall  not be rescheduled by the CSB to a date that precedes the expiration of  the time provided in paragraph (d) of this section for appeal of the  exclusion of counsel, unless the witness consents to an earlier date.
