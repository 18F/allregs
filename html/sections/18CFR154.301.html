The filing and supporting workpapers must be of such composition, scope, and format as to comprise the company's complete case-in-chief in the event that the change is suspended and the matter is set for hearing. If the change in rates or charges presented are not in full accord with any prior Commission decision directly involving the filing company, the company must include in its working papers alternate material reflecting the effect of such prior decision.
