No person other than certified examiners may enter or remain in any underground area unless a preshift examination has been completed for the established 8-hour interval. The operator must establish 8-hour intervals of time subject to the required preshift examinations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a certified person designated by the operator must make a preshift examination within 3 hours preceding the beginning of any 8-hour interval during which any person is scheduled to work or travel underground.

The operator must establish 8-hour intervals of time subject to the required preshift examinations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Preshift examinations of areas where pumpers are scheduled to work or travel shall not be required prior to the pumper entering the areas if the pumper is a certified person and the pumper conducts an examination for hazardous conditions and violations of

the mandatory health or safety standards referenced in paragraph (b)(11) of this section, tests for methane and oxygen deficiency, and determines if the air is moving in its proper direction in the area where the pumper works or travels. The examination of the area must be completed before the pumper performs any other work. A record of all hazardous conditions and violations of the mandatory health or safety standards found by the pumper shall be made and retained in accordance with Sec. 75.363 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The person conducting the preshift examination shall examine for hazardous conditions and violations of the mandatory health or safety standards referenced in paragraph (b)(11) of this section, test for methane and oxygen deficiency, and determine if the air is moving in its proper direction at the following locations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Roadways, travelways and track haulageways where persons are scheduled, prior to the beginning of the preshift examination, to work or travel during the oncoming shift.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Belt conveyors that will be used to transport persons during the oncoming shift and the entries in which these belt conveyors are located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Working sections and areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, if anyone is scheduled to work on the section or in the area during the oncoming shift. The scope of the examination shall include the working places, approaches to worked-out areas and ventilation controls on these sections and in these areas, and the examination shall include tests of the roof, face and rib conditions on these sections and in these areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Approaches to worked-out areas along intake air courses and at the entries used to carry air into worked-out areas if the intake air passing the approaches is used to ventilate working sections where anyone is scheduled to work during the oncoming shift. The examination of the approaches to the worked-out areas shall be made in the intake air course immediately inby and outby each entry used to carry air into the worked-out area. An examination of the entries used to carry air into the worked-out areas shall be conducted at a point immediately inby the intersection of each entry with the intake air course.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Seals along intake air courses where intake air passes by a seal to ventilate working sections where anyone is scheduled to work during the oncoming shift.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)(i)</em> Entries and rooms developed after November 15, 1992, and developed more than 2 crosscuts off an intake air course without permanent ventilation controls where intake air passes through or by these entries or rooms to reach a working section where anyone is scheduled to work during the oncoming shift; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Entries and rooms developed after November 15, 1992, and developed more than 2 crosscuts off an intake air course without permanent ventilation controls where intake air passes through or by these entries or rooms to reach a working section where anyone is scheduled to work during the oncoming shift; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Entries and rooms developed after November 15, 1992, and driven more than 20 feet off an intake air course without a crosscut and without permanent ventilation controls where intake air passes through or by these entries or rooms to reach a working section where anyone is scheduled to work during the oncoming shift.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Areas where trolley wires or trolley feeder wires are to be or will remain energized during the oncoming shift.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> High spots along intake air courses where methane is likely to accumulate, if equipment will be operated in the area during the shift.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Underground electrical installations referred to in Sec. 75.340(a), except those pumps listed in Sec. 75.340 (b)(2) through (b)(6), and areas where compressors subject to Sec. 75.344 are installed if the electrical installation or compressor is or will be energized during the shift.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Other areas where work or travel during the oncoming shift is scheduled prior to the beginning of the preshift examination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Preshift examinations shall include examinations to identify violations of the standards listed below:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sec.

In areas required to be examined outby a working section, the certified person shall certify by initials, date, and the time at enough locations to show that the entire area has been examined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Recordkeeping. A record of the results of each preshift examination, including a record of hazardous conditions and violations of the nine mandatory health or safety standards and their locations found by the examiner during each examination, and of the results and locations of air and methane measurements, shall be made on the surface before any persons, other than certified persons conducting examinations required by this subpart, enter any underground area of the mine. The results of methane tests shall be recorded as the percentage of methane measured by the examiner. The record shall be made by the certified person who made the examination or by a person designated by the operator. If the record is made by someone other than the examiner, the examiner shall verify the record by initials and date by or at the end of the shift for which the examination was made. A record shall also be made by a certified person of the action taken to correct hazardous conditions and violations of mandatory health or safety standards found during the preshift examination. All preshift and corrective action records shall be countersigned by the mine foreman or equivalent mine official by the end of the mine foreman's or equivalent mine official's next regularly scheduled working shift. The records required by this section shall be made in a secure book that is not susceptible to alteration or electronically in a computer system so as to be secure and not susceptible to alteration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Retention period.
