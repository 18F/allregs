                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>, the numerator of the  redetermined applicable fraction is the sum of the amount of GST  exemption currently being allocated to the trust (if any) plus the value  of the nontax portion of the trust, and the denominator of the  redetermined applicable fraction is the value of the trust principal  immediately after the event occurs. The nontax portion of a trust is  determined by multiplying the value of the trust assets, determined  immediately prior to the event, by the then applicable fraction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiple transfers to a single trust. If property is added to an  existing trust, the denominator of the redetermined applicable fraction  is the value of the trust immediately after the addition reduced as  provided in Sec. 26.2642-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consolidation of separate trusts. If separate trusts created by  one transferor are consolidated, a single applicable fraction for the  consolidated trust is determined. The numerator of the redetermined  applicable fraction is the sum of the nontax portions of each trust  immediately prior to the consolidation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>, the applicable fraction immediately  before death is not changed, if the trust was not subject to an ETIP at  the time GST exemption was allocated to the trust. In any event, the  denominator of the applicable fraction is reduced to reflect any federal  or state, estate or inheritance taxes paid from the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Imposition of recapture tax under section 2032A--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If an  additional estate tax is imposed under section 2032A and if the section  2032A election was effective (under Sec. 26.2642-2(b)) for purposes of  the GST tax, the applicable fraction with respect to the property is  redetermined as of the date of death of the transferor. In making the  redetermination, any available GST exemption not allocated at the death  of the transferor (or at a prior recapture event) is automatically  allocated to the property. The denominator of the applicable fraction is  the fair market value of the property at the date of the transferor's  death reduced as provided in Sec. 26.2642-1(c) and further reduced by  the amount of the additional GST tax actually recovered from the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The GST tax imposed with respect to any taxable termination,  taxable distribution, or direct skip occurring prior to the recapture  event is recomputed based on the applicable fraction as redetermined.  Any additional GST tax as recomputed is due and payable on the date that  is six months after the event that causes the imposition of the  additional estate tax under section 2032A. The additional GST tax is  remitted with Form 706-A and is reported by attaching a statement to  Form 706-A showing the computation of the additional GST tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The applicable fraction, as redetermined under this section,  is also used in determining any GST tax imposed with respect to GSTs  occurring after the date of the recapture event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Allocation of additional exemption. T transfers $200,000  to an irrevocable trust under which the income is payable to T's child,  C, for life. Upon the termination of the trust, the remainder is payable  to T's grandchild, GC. At a time when no ETIP exists with respect to the  trust property, T makes a timely allocation of $100,000 of GST  exemption, resulting in an inclusion ratio of .50. Subsequently, when  the entire trust property is valued at $500,000, T allocates an  additional $100,000 of T's unused GST exemption to the trust. The  inclusion ratio of the trust is recomputed at that time. The numerator  of the applicable fraction is $350,000 ($250,000 (the nontax portion as  of the date of the allocation) plus $100,000 (the GST exemption  currently being allocated)). The denominator is $500,000 (the date of  allocation fair market value of the trust). The inclusion ratio is .30  (1 - .70).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Multiple transfers to a trust, allocation both timely and  late. On December 10, 1993, T transfers $10,000 to an irrevocable trust  that does not satisfy the requirements of section 2642(c)(2). T makes  identical transfers to the trust on December 10, 1994, 1995, 1996, and  on January 15, 1997. Immediately after the transfer on January 15, 1997,  the value of the trust principal is $40,000. On January 14, 1998, when  the value of the trust principal is $50,000, T allocates $30,000 of GST  exemption to the trust. T discloses the 1997 transfer on the Form 709  filed on January 14, 1998. Thus, T's allocation is a timely allocation  with respect to the transfer in 1997, $10,000 of the allocation is  effective as of the date of that transfer, and, on and after January 15,  1997, the inclusion ratio of the trust is .75 (1 - ($10,000/$40,000)).  The balance of the allocation is a late allocation with respect to prior  transfers to the trust and is effective as of January 14, 1998. In  redetermining the inclusion ratio as of that date, the numerator of the  redetermined applicable fraction is $32,500 ($12,500 (.25 x $50,000),  the nontax portion of the trust on January 14, 1998) plus $20,000 (the  amount of GST exemption allocated late to the trust). The denominator of  the new applicable fraction is $50,000 (the value of the trust principal  at the time of the late allocation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> T creates an irrevocable trust for  the benefit of T's child and grandchild in 1996 transferring $50,000 to  the trust on the date of creation. T allocates no GST exemption to the  trust on the Form 709 reporting the transfer. On July 1, 1997 (when the  value of the trust property is $60,000), T transfers an additional  $40,000 to the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On April 15, 1998, when the value of the trust is $150,000, T  files a Form 709 reporting the 1997 transfer and allocating $150,000 of  GST exemption to the trust. The allocation is a timely allocation of  $40,000 with respect to the 1997 transfer and is effective as of that  date. Thus, the applicable fraction for the trust as of July 1, 1997 is  .40 ($40,000/$100,000 ($40,000 + $60,000)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The allocation is also a late allocation of $90,000, the  amount necessary to attain a zero inclusion ratio on April 15, 1998,  computed as follows: $60,000 (the nontax portion immediately prior to  the allocation (.40 x $150,000)) plus $90,000 (the additional allocation  necessary to produce a zero inclusion ratio based on a denominator of  $150,000)/$150,000 equals one and, thus, an inclusion ratio of zero. The  balance of the allocation, $20,000 ($150,000 less the timely allocation  of $40,000 less the late allocation of $90,000) is void.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in  Example 3, except that on February 1, 1998 (when the value of the trust  is $150,000), T transfers an additional $50,000 to the trust and the  value of the entire trust corpus on April 15, 1998 is $220,000. The Form  709 filed on April 15, 1998 does not disclose the 1998 transfer. Under  the rule in Sec. 26.2632-1(b)(2)(ii), the allocation is effective first  as a timely allocation to the 1997 transfer; second, as a late  allocation to the trust as of April 15, 1998; and, finally as a timely  allocation to the February 1, 1998 transfer. As of April 15, 1998,  $55,000, a pro rata portion of the trust assets, is considered to be the  property transferred to the trust on February 1, 1998 (($50,000/ $200,000) x $220,000). The balance of the trust, $165,000, represents  prior transfers to the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As in Example 3, the allocation is a timely allocation as to  the 1997 transfer (and the applicable fraction as of July 1, 1997 is  .40) and a late allocation as of 1998. The amount of the late allocation  is $99,000, computed as follows: (.40 x $165,000 plus $99,000)/$165,000  = one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The balance of the allocation, $11,000 ($150,000 less the  timely allocation of $40,000 less the late allocation of $99,000) is a  timely allocation as of February 1, 1998. The applicable fraction with  respect to the trust, as of February 1, 1998, is .355, computed as  follows: $60,000 (the nontax portion of the trust immediately prior to  the February 1, 1998 transfer (.40 x $150,000)) plus $11,000 (the amount  of the timely allocation to the 1998 transfer)/$200,000 (the value of  the trust on February 1, 1998, after the transfer on that date) =  $71,000/$200,000 = .355.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The applicable fraction with respect to the trust, as of April  15, 1998, is .805 computed as follows: $78,100 (the nontax portion  immediately prior to the allocation (.355 x $220,000)) plus $99,000 (the  amount of the late allocation)/ $220,000 = $177,100/$220,000 = .805.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> T transfers $100,000 to an irrevocable trust. The trust instrument  provides that trust income is to be paid to T for 9 years or until T's  prior death. The trust principal is to be paid to T's grandchild, GC,   on the termination of T's income interest. The trustee has the power to  invade trust principal for the benefit of GC during the term of T's  income interest. The trust is subject to an ETIP while T holds the  retained income interest. T files a timely Form 709 reporting the  transfer and allocates $100,000 of GST exemption to the trust. In year  4, when the value of the trust is $200,000, the trustee distributes  $15,000 to GC. The distribution is a taxable distribution. Because of  the existence of the ETIP, the inclusion ratio with respect to the  taxable distribution is determined immediately prior to the occurrence  of the GST. Thus, the inclusion ratio applicable to the year 4 GST is  .50 (1 - ($100,000/$200,000)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In year 5, when the value of the trust is again $200,000, the  trustee distributes another $15,000 to GC. Because the trust is still  subject to the ETIP in year 5, the inclusion ratio with respect to the  year 5 GST is again computed immediately prior to the GST. In computing  the new inclusion ratio, the numerator of the applicable fraction is  reduced by the nontax portion of prior GSTs occurring during the ETIP.  Thus, the numerator of the applicable fraction with respect to the GST  in year 5 is $92,500 ($100,000 - (.50 x $15,000)) and the inclusion  ratio applicable with respect to the GST in year 5 is .537 (1 -  ($92,500/$200,000) = .463). Any additional GST exemption allocated on a  timely ETIP return with respect to the GST in year 5 is effective  immediately prior to the transfer.
