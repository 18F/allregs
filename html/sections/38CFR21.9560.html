                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overview. Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (f) of  this section, VA will base entitlement charges on the principle that an  eligible individual who is paid educational assistance for one day of  full-time pursuit should be charged one day of entitlement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determining entitlement charge. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> VA will make a charge  against entitlement as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Full-time pursuit. If the individual is pursuing a program of  education on a full-time basis, the entitlement charge will be one of  the following--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> During any period for which VA pays established charges to the  institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf, the  entitlement charge will be one day for each day of the certified  enrollment period;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> During any period for which VA does not pay established charges  to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf but  pays a monthly housing allowance to the individual, the entitlement  charge will be one day for each day of the certified enrollment period  and/or interval period for which the individual receives the monthly  housing allowance; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> During any period for which VA does not pay established charges  to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf or a  monthly housing allowance to the individual but makes a lump sum payment  to the individual for books, supplies, equipment, and other educational  costs, VA will make an entitlement charge of 1 day for every $41.67  paid, with any remaining amount rounded to the nearest amount evenly  divisible by $41.67.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Less than full-time pursuit. If the individual is pursuing a  program of education on a less than a full-time basis, the entitlement  charge will be one of the following--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> During any period for which VA pays established charges to the  institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf, the  individual will be charged a percentage of a day for each day of the  certified enrollment period determined by dividing the number of course  hours the individual is pursuing by the number of course hours required  for full-time pursuit (rounded to the nearest hundredth);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> During any period for which VA does not pay established charges  to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf but  pays a monthly housing allowance to the individual, the individual will  be charged a percentage of a day for each day of the certified  enrollment period and/or interval period for which the individual  receives the monthly housing allowance determined by dividing the number  of course hours the individual is pursuing by the number of course hours  required for full-time pursuit (rounded to the nearest hundredth); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> During any period for which VA does not pay established charges  to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf or a  monthly housing allowance to the individual but makes a lump sum payment  to the individual for books, supplies, equipment, and other educational  costs, VA will make an entitlement charge of 1   day for every $41.67 paid, with any remaining amount rounded to the  nearest amount evenly divisible by $41.67.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3313)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the individual changes his or her rate of pursuit after the  beginning date of the award, VA will--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Divide the certified enrollment period into separate periods of  time so that the individual's rate of pursuit is constant within each  period; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Compute the rate of pursuit separately for each time period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Individuals eligible for, or in receipt of, educational  assistance other than that authorized under chapter 33. If an individual  elected 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 by relinquishing educational assistance  under another program but receives educational assistance for a program  of education that is approved under the relinquished chapter but not  approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33, VA will make a charge against  entitlement equivalent to the entitlement charge--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That would be made under the provisions of Sec. 21.7076, if the  individual relinquished eligibility under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That would be made under the provisions of Sec. 21.7576 if the  individual relinquished eligibility under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That would be made under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1607 if the  individual relinquished eligibility under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1607.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No entitlement charge. VA will not make a charge against an  individual's entitlement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For an approved licensing or certification test as provided  under Sec. 21.9665; or   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3315)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For tutorial assistance as provided under Sec. 21.9685; or   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3314)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the rural relocation benefit as provided under Sec.  21.9660; or   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3318)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For pursuit of a course or courses when the individual--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Had to discontinue the course or courses as a result of being  ordered to--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Active duty service under 10 U.S.C. 688, 12301(a), 12301(d),  12301(g), 12302, or 12304; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A new duty location or assignment or to perform an increased  amount of work; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Did not receive credit or lost training time for any portion of  the period of enrollment in the course or courses for which the eligible  individual was pursuing to complete his or her approved educational,  professional, or vocational objective as a result of having to  discontinue pursuit.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3312(c))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Interruption to conserve entitlement. An individual may not  interrupt a certified period of enrollment for the purpose of conserving  entitlement. An institution of higher learning may not certify a period  of enrollment for a fractional part of the normal term, quarter, or  semester if the individual is enrolled for the entire term, quarter, or  semester. VA will make a charge against entitlement for the entire  period of certified enrollment, if the individual is otherwise eligible  for educational assistance, except when educational assistance is  interrupted for any of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Enrollment is terminated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The individual cancels his or her enrollment and does not  negotiate a check or receive a direct deposit for educational assistance  provided under this chapter for any part of the certified period of  enrollment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The individual interrupts his or her enrollment at the end of  any term, quarter, or semester within a certified period of enrollment  and does not negotiate a check or receive a direct deposit for  educational assistance provided under this chapter for the succeeding  term, quarter, or semester; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The individual requests interruption or cancellation for any  break when a school was closed during a certified period of enrollment,  and VA continued payments under an established policy based upon an  Executive Order of the President or an emergency situation regardless of  whether or not the individual negotiated a check or   received a direct deposit for educational assistance provided under this  chapter for any part of the certified enrollment period.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3323(c))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Overpayment cases. VA will make a charge against entitlement for  an overpayment only if the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy, is  waived and not recovered, or is compromised.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy or is waived and  not recovered, the charge against entitlement will be the appropriate  rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of  interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal  fees).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is  less than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection,  court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be at  the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment  (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs  and marshal fees).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is  equal to or greater than the amount of interest, administrative costs of  collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement  will be determined by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subtracting from the sum paid in the compromise offer the amount  attributable to interest, administrative costs of collection, court  costs and marshal fees;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subtracting the remaining amount of the overpayment balances as  determined in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section from the amount of the  original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of  collection, course costs and marshal fees);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Dividing the result obtained in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this  section from the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of  interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal  fees); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Multiplying the percentage obtained in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of  this section by the amount of entitlement otherwise chargeable for the  period of the original overpayment.
