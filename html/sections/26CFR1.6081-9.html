                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A corporation required to file a return on Form 990- T will be allowed an automatic six-month extension of time to file the  return after the date prescribed for filing if the corporation files an  application in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. In any  other case, an exempt organization required to file a return on Form 990  (series, except for Form 990-C), 1041-A, 4720, 5227, 6069, or 8870 will  be allowed an automatic three-month extension of time to file the return  after the date prescribed for filing if the exempt organization files an  application in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. For  guidance on extensions of time for an exempt organization to file Form  990-C, ``Farmer's Cooperative Association Income Tax Return,'' or Form  1120-POL, ``U.S. Income Tax Return for Certain Political  Organizations,'' see Sec. 1.6081-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, an application for  an automatic extension under this section must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be submitted on Form 8868, ``Application for Extension of Time  To File an Exempt Organization Return,'' or in any other manner as may  be prescribed by the Commissioner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be filed with the Internal Revenue Service office designated in  the application's instructions on or before the date prescribed for  filing the return;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Show the full amount properly estimated as tentative tax for the  exempt organization for the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Be accompanied by the full remittance of the amount properly  estimated as tentative tax which is unpaid as of the date prescribed for  the filing of the return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination of automatic extension. The Commissioner may  terminate an automatic extension at any time by mailing to the exempt  organization a notice of termination. The notice must be mailed at least  10 days prior to the termination date designated in such notice. The  notice of termination must be mailed to the address shown on the  application for extension or to the exempt organization's last known  address. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known  address, see Sec. 301.6212-2 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Penalties. See sections 6651 and 6652(c) for failure to file an  exempt organization return or failure to pay the amount shown as tax on  the return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Coordination with Sec. 1.6081-1. No extension of time will be  granted under Sec. 1.6081-1 for filing an exempt organization return  listed in paragraph (a) of this section until an automatic extension has  been allowed pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. This section applies to requests for extensions  of time to file an exempt organization return due after December 7,  2004.  [T.D. 9163, 69 FR 70549, Dec. 7, 2004]</p>
