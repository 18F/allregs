Insured Crop</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The crop insured will be each small grain you elect to insure, that is grown in the county on insurable acreage, and for which premium rates are provided by the actuarial documents:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In which you have a share;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That is planted for harvest as grain (a grain mixture in which barley or oats is the predominate grain may also be insured if allowed by the Barley or Oat Special Provisions, or if a written agreement allows insurance for such mixture. The production from such mixture will be considered as the predominate grain on a weight basis); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> That is not, unless insurance is allowed by a written agreement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interplanted with another crop except as allowed in section 6(a)(2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Planted into an established grass or legume; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Planted as a nurse crop, unless planted as a nurse crop for new forage seeding, but only if seeded at a normal rate and intended for harvest as grain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Buckwheat will be insured only if it is produced under a contract with a business enterprise equipped with facilities appropriate to handle and store buckwheat production. The contract must be executed by you and the business enterprise, in effect for the crop year, and a copy provided to us no later than the acreage reporting date. To be considered a contract, the executed document must contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A requirement that you plant, grow and deliver buckwheat to the business enterprise;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of production that will be accepted or a statement that all production from a specified number of acres will be accepted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The price to be paid for the contracted production or a method to determine such price; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other such terms that establish the obligations of each party to the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If you anticipate destroying any acreage prior to harvest you:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> May report all planted acreage when you report your acreage for the crop year and specify any acreage to be destroyed as uninsurable acreage (By doing so, no coverage will be considered to have attached on the specified acreage and no premium will be due for such acreage. If you do not destroy such acreage, you will be subject to the under-reporting provisions contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> May report all planted acreage as insurable when you report your acreage for the crop year. Premium will be due on all the acreage except as set forth herein. If the Special Provisions allow a reduced premium amount for acreage intentionally destroyed prior to harvest, you may qualify for such reduction only if you notify us in writing on or before the date designated in the Special Provisions of the intended destruction, and do not claim an indemnity on the acreage. No premium reduction will be allowed if the required notice is not given or if you claim an indemnity for the acreage. Upon receiving timely notice, insurance coverage on the acreage you do not intend to harvest will cease and we will revise your acreage report to indicate the applicable reduction in premium. If you do not destroy the crop as intended, you will be subject to the under-reporting provisions contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In counties for which the actuarial table provides premium rates for the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement (7 CFR 457.102), coverage is available for wheat or barley damaged between the time coverage begins and the spring final planting date. Coverage under the endorsement is effective only if you qualify under the terms of the endorsement and you execute the endorsement by the sales closing date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> In counties for which the actuarial table provides premium rates for malting barley coverage, an endorsement is available (7 CFR 457.118) that provides additional insurance protection for malting barley. This endorsement provides coverage for producers who grow malting barley under contract and for those who do not have a contract. Coverage under the endorsement is effective only if you qualify under the terms of the endorsement and you execute the endorsement by the sales closing date.</p><p class="depth0">7. Insurance Period</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 11 of the Basic Provisions, and subject to any provisions provided by the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement (if elected by you):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Insurance attaches on each unit or part thereof on the later of the date we accept your application or the date the insured crop is planted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For oats, rye, flax and buckwheat, the following limitations apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions for the insured crop except as allowed in section 12 of these Crop Provisions and section 16 of the Basic Provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that producers in the surrounding area would not normally further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical to replant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For barley and wheat, the following limitations apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions for the type (winter or spring) except as allowed in section 12 of these Crop Provisions and section 16 of the Basic Provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a fall final planting date, any acreage of winter barley or wheat damaged before such final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a winter type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whenever the Special Provisions designate both fall and spring final planting dates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any winter barley or winter wheat that is damaged before the spring final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a winter type of the insured crop to maintain insurance based on the winter type unless we agree that replanting is not practical. If it is not practical to replant to the winter type of wheat or barley but is practical to replant to a spring type, you must replant to a spring type to keep your insurance based on the winter type in force.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any winter barley or winter wheat acreage that is replanted to a spring type of the same crop when it was practical to replant the winter type will be insured as the spring type and the production guarantee, premium, projected price, and harvest price applicable to the spring type will be used. In this case, the acreage will be considered to be initially planted to the spring type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Notwithstanding sections 7(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B), if you have elected coverage under a barley or wheat winter coverage endorsement (if available in the county), insurance will be in accordance with the endorsement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whenever the Special Provisions designate a spring final planting date, any acreage of spring barley or wheat damaged before

such final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a spring type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a spring final planting date, any acreage of fall planted barley or fall planted wheat is not insured unless you request such coverage on or before the spring sales closing date, and we determine, in writing, that the acreage has an adequate stand in the spring to produce the yield used to determine your production guarantee.

For example, if damaged spring wheat is replanted to durum wheat, your projected price applicable to durum wheat will be used to calculate any replanting payment that may be due. A revised acreage report will be required to reflect the replanted type. Notwithstanding the previous two sentences, the following will have a replanting payment based on your production guarantee and your price election or your projected price, as applicable, for the crop type initially planted:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any damaged winter crop type that is replanted to a spring crop type, but that retains insurance based on the winter crop type; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any acreage replanted at a reduced seeding rate into a partially damaged stand of the insured crop.</p><p class="depth0">10.
