                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, (e), and (f)). Acceptable evidence  normally consists of a commitment or explicit arrangement, that will be  in existence at the time of contract award, to rent, purchase, or  otherwise acquire the needed facilities, equipment, other resources, or  personnel. Consideration of a prime contractor's compliance with  limitations on subcontracting shall take into account the time period  covered by the contract base period or quantities plus option periods or  quantities, if such options are considered when evaluating offers for  award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Satisfactory performance record. A prospective contractor that  is or recently has been seriously deficient in contract performance  shall be presumed to be nonresponsible, unless the contracting officer  determines that the circumstances were properly beyond the contractor's  control, or that the contractor has taken appropriate corrective action.  Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform  acceptably is strong evidence of nonresponsibility. Failure to meet the  quality requirements of the contract is a significant factor to consider  in determining satisfactory performance. The contracting officer shall  consider the number of contracts involved and the extent of deficient  performance in each contract when making this determination. If the  pending contract requires a subcontracting plan pursuant to Subpart  19.7, The Small Business Subcontracting Program, the contracting officer  shall also consider the prospective contractor's compliance with  subcontracting plans under recent contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Affiliated concerns. Affiliated concerns (see Concern in 19.001  and Affiliates in 19.101) are normally considered separate entities in  determining whether the concern that is to perform the contract meets  the applicable standards for responsibility. However, the contracting  officer shall consider the affiliate's past performance and integrity  when they may adversely affect the prospective contractor's  responsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Small business concerns. Upon making a determination of  nonresponsibility with regard to a small business concern, the  contracting officer shall refer the matter to the Small Business  Administration, which will decide whether to issue a Certificate of  Competency (see subpart 19.6).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A small business that is unable to comply with the limitations  on subcontracting at 52.219-14 may be considered nonresponsible.
