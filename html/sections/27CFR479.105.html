                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. As provided by 26 U.S.C. 5812 and 26 U.S.C. 5822, an  application to make or transfer a firearm shall be denied if the making,  transfer, receipt, or possession of the firearm would place the maker or  transferee in violation of law. Section 922(o), Title 18, U.S.C., makes  it unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine gun, except  a transfer to or by, or possession by or under the authority of, the  United States or any department or agency thereof or a State, or a  department, agency, or political subdivision thereof; or any lawful  transfer or lawful possession of a machine gun that was lawfully  possessed before May 19, 1986. Therefore, notwithstanding any other  provision of this part, no application to make, transfer, or import a  machine gun will be approved except as provided by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Machine guns lawfully possessed prior to May 19, 1986. A machine  gun possessed in compliance with the provisions of this part prior to  May 19, 1986, may continue to be lawfully possessed by the person to  whom the machine gun is registered and may, upon compliance with the  provisions of this part, be lawfully transferred to and possessed by the  transferee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Importation and manufacture. Subject to compliance with the  provisions of this part, importers and manufacturers qualified under  this part may import and manufacture machine guns on or after May 19,  1986, for sale or distribution to any department or agency of the United  States or any State or political subdivision thereof, or for use by  dealers qualified under this part as sales samples as provided in  paragraph (d) of this section. The registration of such machine guns  under this part and their subsequent transfer shall be conditioned upon  and restricted to the sale or distribution of such weapons for the  official use of Federal, State or local governmental entities. Subject  to compliance with the provisions of this part, manufacturers qualified  under this part may manufacture machine guns on or after May 19, 1986,  for exportation in compliance with the Arms Export Control Act (22  U.S.C. 2778) and regulations prescribed thereunder by the Department of  State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Dealer sales samples. Subject to compliance with the provisions  of this part, applications to transfer and register a machine gun  manufactured or imported on or after May 19, 1986, to dealers qualified  under this part will be approved if it is established by specific  information the expected governmental customers who would require a  demonstration of the weapon, information as to the availability of the  machine gun to fill subsequent orders, and letters from governmental  entities expressing a need for a particular model or interest in seeing  a demonstration of a particular weapon. Applications to transfer more  than one machine gun of a particular model to a dealer must also  establish the dealer's need for the quantity of samples sought to be  transferred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The making of machine guns on or after May 19, 1986. Subject to  compliance with the provisions of this part, applications to make and  register machine guns on or after May 19, 1986, for the benefit of a  Federal, State or local governmental entity (e.g., an invention for  possible future use of a governmental entity or the making of a weapon  in connection with research and development on behalf of such an entity)  will be approved if it is established by specific information that the  machine gun is particularly suitable for use by Federal, State or local  governmental entities and that the making of the weapon is at the  request and on behalf of such an entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Discontinuance of business. Since section 922(o), Title 18,  U.S.C., makes it unlawful to transfer or possess a machine gun except as  provided in the law, any qualified manufacturer, importer, or dealer  intending to discontinue business shall, prior to going out of business,  transfer in compliance with the provisions of this part any   machine gun manufactured or imported after May 19, 1986, to a Federal,  State or local governmental entity, qualified manufacturer, qualified  importer, or, subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this  section, dealer qualified to possess such, machine gun.
