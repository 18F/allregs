                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section prescribes the performance requirements for glide path equipment components of the ISMLS. These requirements are based on the assumption that the aircraft is heading directly toward the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The glide slope antenna system must be located near the approach end of the runway, and the equipment must be adjusted so that the vertical path line will be in a sloping horizontal plane containing the centerline of the runway being served, and satisfy the coverage requirements prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section. For the purpose of obstacle clearance, location of the glide slope antenna system must be in accordance with the criteria specified in subpart C of part 97 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The radiation from the glide path antenna system must produce a composite field pattern which is pulse duration modulated by a 90 Hz and a 150 Hz tone, which is the time average equivalent to amplitude modulation. The pattern must be arranged to provide a straight line descent path in the vertical plane containing the centerline of the runway, with the 150 Hz tone predominating below the path and the 90 Hz tone predominating above the path to at least an angle equal to 1.752[thetas]. As used in this section theta ([thetas]), denotes the nominal glide path angle. The glide path angle must be adjusted and maintained within 0.075[thetas].</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The glide path equipment must be capable of producing a radiated glide path from 3 to 9 degrees with respect to the horizontal. However, ISMLS glide path angles in excess of 3 degrees may be used to satisfy instrument approach procedures or to overcome an obstruction clearance problem, only in accordance with the criteria specified in subpart C of part 97 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The downward extended straight portion of the ISMLS glide path must pass through the ISMLS reference datum at a height ensuring safe guidance over obstructions and safe and efficient use of the runway served. The height of the ISMLS reference datum must be in accordance with subpart C of part 97 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The glide path equipment must operate in the band 5220 MHz to 5250 MHz. The frequency tolerance may not exceed 0.0001 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The emission from the glide path equipment must be vertically polarized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The glide path equipment must provide signals sufficient to allow satisfactory operation of a typical aircraft installation insectors of 8 degrees on each side of the centerline of the ISMLS glide path, to a distance of at least 10 nautical miles up to 1.75[thetas] and down to 0.45[thetas] above the horizontal or to such lower angle at which 0.22 DDM is realized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> To provide the coverage for glide path performance specified in paragraph (g) of this section, the minimum peak field strength within this coverage sector must be -82 dBW/m\2\. The peak field strength must be provided on the glide path down to a height of 30 meters (100 feet) above the horizontal plane containing the threshold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Bends in the glide path may not have amplitudes which exceed the following:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Amplitude</p><p class="depth0"><em>(DDM)</em> (95</p><p class="depth0">Zone                                 pct.</p><p class="depth0">probability)------------------------------------------------------------------------Outer limit of coverage to ISMLS point ``C.''.............        0.035.------------------------------------------------------------------------

The amplitude referred to is the DDM due to bends as realized on the mean ISMLS glide path correctly adjusted. In regions of the approach where ISMLS glide path curvature is significant, bend amplitude is calculated from the mean curved path, and not the downward extended straight line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Guidance modulation must be impressed on the microwave carrier of the radiated glide slope signal in the form of a unique summation of 90 Hz and 150 Hz sinusoidal modulation corresponding to the point direction of the particular beam which radiates the signal. Each of the effective beam positions must be illuminated in sequence for a short time interval. The scan rate must be synchronous with the 90 and 150 Hz tone base. The modulation impressed on each beam must be a sample of the combined 90 Hz and 150 Hz waveform appropriate for that particular beam direction and time slot. The actual modulation must be accomplished by appropriately varying the length of time the carrier is radiated during each beam illumination interval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> The nominal depth of modulation of the radio frequency carrier due to each of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz tones must be 40 percent along the ISMLS glide path. The depth of modulation may not deviate outside the limits of 37.5 percent to 42.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> The following tolerances apply to the frequencies of the modulating tones:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The modulating tones must be 90 Hz and 150 Hz within 2.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total harmonic content of the 90 Hz tone may not exceed 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The total harmonic content of the 150 Hz tone may not exceed 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> At every half cycle of the combined 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave form, the modulation must be phase-locked so that, within the ISMLS half glide path sector, the demodulated 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave forms pass through zero in the same direction within 20 degrees of phase relative to the 150 Hz component. However, the phase need not be measured within the ISMLS half glide path sector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> The nominal angular displacement sensitivity must correspond to a DDM of 0.0875 at an angular displacement above and below the glide path of 0.12[thetas]. The glide path angular displacement sensitivity must be adjusted and maintained within 25 percent of the nominal value selected. The upper and lower sectors must be as symmetrical as practicable within the limits prescribed in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> The DDM below the ISMLS glide path must increase smoothly for decreasing angle until a value of 0.22 DDM is reached. This value must be achieved at an angle not less than 0.30[thetas] above the horizontal. However, if it is achieved at an angle above 0.45[thetas], the DDM value may not be less than 0.22 at least down to an angle of 0.45[thetas].
