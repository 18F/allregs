                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> The purpose of the evaluation procedure specified in this section is to determine the effect of thermal stress on catalyst conversion efficiency. The thermal stress is imposed on the test catalyst by exposing it to quiescent heated air in an oven. The evaluation of the effect of such stress on catalyst performance is based on the resultant degradation of the efficiency with which the conversions of specific pollutants are promoted. The application of this evaluation procedure involves the several steps that are described in the following paragraphs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The purpose of the evaluation procedure specified in this section is to determine the effect of thermal stress on catalyst conversion efficiency.
