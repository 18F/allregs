                            <p class="depth0">S1. Purpose and scope. This standard establishes requirements for seat belt assembly anchorages to insure their proper location for effective occupant restraint and to reduce the likelihood of their failure.</p><p class="depth0">S2. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, and school buses.</p><p class="depth0">S3. Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">School bus torso belt adjusted height means the vertical height above the seating reference point (SgRP) of the horizontal plane containing a segment of the torso belt centerline located 25 mm to 75 mm forward of the torso belt height adjuster device, when the torso belt retractor is locked and the torso belt is pulled away from the seat back by applying a 20 N horizontal force in the forward direction through the webbing at a location 100 mm or more forward of the adjustment device as shown in Figure 5.</p><p class="depth0">School bus torso belt anchor point means the midpoint of the torso belt width where the torso belt first contacts the uppermost torso belt anchorage. Seat belt anchorage means any component, other than the webbing or straps, involved in transferring seat belt loads to the vehicle structure, including, but not limited to, the attachment hardware, seat frames, seat pedestals, the vehicle structure itself, and any part of the vehicle whose failure causes separation of the belt from the vehicle structure.</p><p class="depth0">Small occupant seating position is as defined in 49 CFR 571.222.</p><p class="depth0">S4. Requirements.</p><p class="depth0">S4.1 Type.</p><p class="depth0">S4.1.1 Seat belt anchorages for a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt assembly shall be installed for each designated seating position for which a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt assembly is required by Standard No. 208 (49 CFR 571.208). Seat belt anchorages for a Type 2 seat belt assembly shall be installed for each designated seating position for which a Type 2 seat belt assembly is required by Standard No. 208 (49 CFR 571.208).</p><p class="depth0">S4.1.2 (a) Notwithstanding the requirement of S4.1.1, each vehicle manufactured on or after September 1, 1987 that is equipped with an automatic restraint at the front right outboard designated seating position, which automatic restraint cannot be used for securing a child restraint system or cannot be adjusted by the vehicle owner to secure a child restraint system solely through the use of attachment hardware installed as an item of original equipment by the vehicle manufacturer, shall have, at the manufacturer's option, either anchorages for a Type 1 seat belt assembly installed at that position or a Type 1 or Type 2 seat belt assembly installed at that position. If a manufacturer elects to install anchorages for a Type 1 seat belt assembly to comply with this requirement, those anchorages shall consist of, at a minimum, holes threaded to accept bolts that comply with S4.1(f) of Standard No. 209 (49 CFR 571.209).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The requirement in S4.1.1 of this standard that seat belt anchorages for a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt assembly shall be installed for certain designated seating positions does not apply to any such seating positions that are equipped with a seat belt assembly that meets the frontal crash protection requirements of S5.1 of Standard No. 208 (49 CFR 571.208).</p><p class="depth0">S4.1.3 School bus passenger seats.</p><p class="depth0">S4.1.3.1 For school buses manufactured on or after October 21, 2011, seat belt anchorages for school bus passenger seats must be attached to the school bus seat structure, including seats with wheelchair positions or side emergency doors behind them.
