                                Sec.  250.457  What equipment is required to monitor drilling fluids?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Once you establish drilling fluid returns, you must install and maintain the following drilling fluid-system

monitoring equipment throughout subsequent drilling operations. This equipment must have the following indicators on the rig floor:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pit level indicator to determine drilling fluid-pit volume gains and losses. This indicator must include both a visual and an audible warning device;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Volume measuring device to accurately determine drilling fluid volumes required to fill the hole on trips;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Return indicator devices that indicate the relationship between drilling fluid-return flow rate and pump discharge rate. This indicator must include both a visual and an audible warning device; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Gas-detecting equipment to monitor the drilling fluid returns. The indicator may be located in the drilling fluid-logging compartment or on the rig floor. If the indicators are only in the logging compartment, you must continually man the equipment and have a means of immediate communication with the rig floor. If the indicators are on the rig floor only, you must install an audible alarm.</p>
