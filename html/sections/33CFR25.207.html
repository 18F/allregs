                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A settlement authority may administratively settle and approve a claim for final payment within two years from the date that the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, the claim is barred. This two-year period is not extended by presenting a claim nor by negotiations or correspondence. The existence of an administrative claim does not extend the two year statute of limitations in 46 U.S.C. 745.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a complaint is filed in a Federal District Court before the expiration of the two-year period, an administrative settlement may be negotiated by the settlement authority only with the consent of the Department of Justice. Payment is made upon final dismissal of the complaint.</p>
