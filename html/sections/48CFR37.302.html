However, the contracting officer may require the  contractor to furnish a performance bond or other security (see 28.103)  in an amount that the contracting officer considers adequate to (a)  ensure completion of the work, (b) protect property to be retained by  the Government, (c) protect property to be provided as compensation to  the contractor, and (d) protect the Government against damage to  adjoining property.
