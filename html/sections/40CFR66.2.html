Subpart A describes the scope of the part, defines key terms and states the manner of operation of these provisions subpart B states which sources of air pollution are subject to these penalties and the form and substance of the notice of noncompliance. Subpart C and the accompanying Technical Support Document and Manual state how a source must compute the penalty which it owes. Subpart D describes the conditions under which an exemption from the penalty may be available, and subpart E sets forth the procedures for requesting such an exemption. Subpart F states how EPA will review penalties calculated by sources under subpart C, and subpart G describes the method of payment. Subpart H provides for adjustment of the penalty after the source has come into compliance and the actual costs of doing so are known. Finally, subpart I states which actions under these regulations are subject to judicial review and on what conditions, and subpart J provides supplemental procedures for adjudicatory hearings.</p>
