The indexing year is never earlier than the second year before the

year of the employee's death.

In this instance, the widow(er)'s, remarried widow(er)'s, or surviving divorced spouse's tier I annuity component after applying any reduction for age is further reduced to the larger of amount the employee would have received as a tier I annuity component if still alive or 82\1/2\ percent of his or her primary insurance amount.</p>
