                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A State may qualify for Incentive Funds if it can demonstrate that its CMV safety program has shown improvement in any or all of the following five categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reduction of large truck-involved fatal accidents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reduction of large truck-involved fatal accident rate or maintenance of a large truck-involved fatal accident rate that is among the lowest 10 percent of such rates of MCSAP recipients.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upload of CMV accident reports in accordance with current FMCSA policy guidelines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Verification of CDLs during all roadside inspections.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Upload of CMV inspection data in accordance with current FMCSA policy guidelines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Incentive Funds will be distributed based upon the five following safety and program performance factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Five shares will be awarded to States that reduce the number of large truck-involved fatal accidents for the most recent calendar year for which data are available when compared to the 10-year average number of large truck-involved fatal accidents ending with the preceding year. The 10-year average will be computed from the number of large truck-involved fatal crashes, as reported by the FARS, administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Four shares will be awarded to States that reduce the fatal-accident rate for the most recent calendar year for which data are available when compared to each State's average fatal accident rate for the preceding 10-year period. States with the lowest 10 percent of accident rates in the most recent calendar year for which data are available will be awarded three shares if the rate for the State is the same as its average accident rate for the preceding 10-year period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Two shares will be awarded to States that upload CMV accident data within FMCSA policy guidelines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Two shares will be awarded to States that certify their MCSAP inspection agencies have departmental policies that stipulate CDLs are verified, as part of the inspection process, through Commercial Driver's License Information System (CDLIS), National Law Enforcement Tracking System (NLETS), or the State licensing authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Two shares will be awarded to States that upload CMV inspection reports within current FMCSA policy guidelines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The total of all States' shares awarded will be divided into the dollar amount of Incentive Funds available, thereby establishing the value of one share. Each State's incentive allocation will then be determined by multiplying the State's percentage participation in the formula allocation of Basic Program Funds, by the number of shares it received that year, multiplied by the dollar value of one share.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> States may use Incentive Funds for any eligible CMV safety purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Incentive Funds are subject to the same State matching requirements as Basic Program Funds.
