Following decision by the administrative law judge or  deputy commissioner pursuant to either paragraph (d) or (e) of this  section, a new notice of appeal shall be filed with the Clerk of the  Board by any party who wishes to appeal. During the pendency of an  appeal to the Board, any party having knowledge that a motion for  reconsideration of a decision or order of an administrative law judge or  deputy commissioner has been filed shall notify the Board of such  filing.</p>
