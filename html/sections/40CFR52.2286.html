The certification shall be submitted not later than February 15, 1978, for award of contracts and initiation of construction, and not later than October 15, 1978, for completion of construction and final compliance. The certification shall include the name(s) and street address(es) of the facility (facilities) for which the certification applies, and the date(s) the increment(s) of progress was (were) met--if met.
