                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Atomic weapons employer (AWE) means any entity, other than the United States, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> processed or produced, for use by the United States, material that emitted radiation and was used in the production of an atomic weapon, excluding uranium mining and milling; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> is designated by the Secretary of Energy as an atomic weapons employer for purposes of EEOICPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bioassay means the determination of the kinds, quantities, or concentrations, and in some cases, locations of radioactive material in the human body, whether by direct measurement or by analysis, and evaluation of radioactive material excreted or eliminated by the body.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claimant means the individual who has filed with the Department of Labor for compensation under EEOICPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Covered employee means, for the purposes of this part, an individual who is or was an employee of DOE, a DOE contractor or subcontractor, or an atomic weapons employer, and for whom DOL has requested HHS to perform a dose reconstruction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Covered facility means any building, structure, or premises, including the grounds upon which such building, structure, or premise is located:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In which operations are, or have been, conducted by, or on behalf of, the DOE (except for buildings, structures, premises, grounds, or operations covered by Executive Order 12344, dated February 1, 1982, pertaining to the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program); and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With regard to which the DOE has or had:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A proprietary interest; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Entered into a contract with an entity to provide management and operation, management and integration, environmental remediation services, construction, or maintenance services; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A facility owned by an entity designated by the Secretary of Energy as an atomic weapons employer for purposes of EEOICPA that is or was used to process or produce, for use by the United States, material that emitted radiation and was used in the production of an atomic weapon, excluding uranium mining or milling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> DOE means the U.S. Department of Energy, and includes predecessor agencies of DOE, including the Manhattan Engineering District.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> DOL means the U.S. Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> EEOICPA means the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. 7384-7385 [1994, supp. 2001].</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Equivalent dose is the absorbed dose in a tissue multiplied by a radiation weighting factor to account for differences in the effectiveness of the radiation in inducing cancer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> External dose means that portion of the equivalent dose that is received from radiation sources outside of the body.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Internal dose means that portion of the equivalent dose that is received from radioactive materials taken into the body.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> NIOSH means the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Primary cancer means a cancer defined by the original body site at which the cancer was incurred, prior to any spread (metastasis) resulting in tumors at other sites in the body.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Probability of causation means the probability or likelihood that a cancer was caused by radiation exposure incurred by a covered employee in the performance of duty. In statistical terms, it is the cancer risk attributable to radiation exposure divided by the sum of the baseline cancer risk (the risk to the general population) plus the cancer risk attributable to the radiation exposure. This concept is further

explained under 42 CFR part 81, which provides guidelines by which DOL will determine probability of causation under EEOICPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Radiation means ionizing radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, x rays, neutrons, protons and other particles capable of producing ions in the body. For purposes of this rule, radiation does not include sources of non-ionizing radiation such as radio-frequency radiation, microwaves, visible light, and infrared or ultraviolet light radiation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Specified cancer is a term defined in Section 3621(17) of EEOICPA and 20 CFR 30.5(dd) that specifies types of cancer that, pursuant to 20 CFR part 30, may qualify a member of the Special Exposure Cohort for compensation. It includes leukemia (other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia), multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cancers of the lung (other than carcinoma in situ diagnosed at autopsy), thyroid, male breast, female breast, esophagus, stomach, pharynx, small intestine, pancreas, bile ducts, gall bladder, salivary gland, urinary bladder, brain, colon, ovary, liver (not associated with cirrhosis or hepatitis), and bone. Pursuant to section 2403 of Public Law 107-20, this definition will include renal cancer effective October 1, 2001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Uncertainty distribution is a statistical term meaning a range of discrete or continuous values arrayed around a central estimate, where each value is assigned a probability of being correct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Worst-case assumption is a term used to describe a type of assumption used in certain instances for certain dose reconstructions conducted under this rule. It assigns the highest reasonably possible value, based on reliable science, documented experience, and relevant data, to a radiation dose of a covered employee.</p>
