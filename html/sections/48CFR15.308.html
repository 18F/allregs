                            <p class="depth0">The source selection authority's (SSA) decision shall be based on a  comparative assessment of proposals against all source selection  criteria in the solicitation. While the SSA may use reports and analyses  prepared by others, the source selection decision shall represent the  SSA's independent judgment. The source selection decision shall be  documented, and the documentation shall include the rationale for any  business judgments and tradeoffs made or relied on by the SSA, including  benefits associated with additional costs. Although the rationale for  the selection decision must be documented, that documentation need not  quantify the tradeoffs that led to the decision.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 15.4_Contract Pricing</p>
