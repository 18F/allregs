                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each engine must be subjected to those calibration tests necessary to establish its power characteristics and the conditions for the endurance test specified Sec. 33.87. The results of the power characteristics calibration tests form the basis for establishing the characteristics of the engine over its entire operating range of speeds, pressures, temperatures, and altitudes. Power ratings are based upon standard atmospheric conditions with no airbleed for aircraft services and with only those accessories installed which are essential for engine functioning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A power check at sea level conditions must be accomplished on the endurance test engine after the endurance test and any change in power characteristics which occurs during the endurance test must be determined. Measurements taken during the final portion of the endurance test may be used in showing compliance with the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In showing compliance with this section, each condition must stabilize before measurements are taken, except as permitted by paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the case of engines having 30-second OEI, and 2-minute OEI ratings, measurements taken during the applicable endurance test prescribed in Sec. 33.87(f) (1) through (8) may be used in showing compliance with the requirements of this section for these OEI ratings.
