CMS considers the following factors  in determining whether a nonparticipating hospital in a rural area meets  the accessibility requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The relative distances of participating and nonparticipating  hospitals in the area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The transportation facilities available to these hospitals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The quality of the roads to each hospital.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The availability of beds at each hospital.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other factors that bear on whether or not the services could  be provided sooner in the nonparticipating hospitals than in a  participating hospital in the general area.  In urban and suburban areas where both participating and  nonparticipating hospitals are similarly available, CMS presumes that  the services could have been provided in a participating hospital unless  clear and convincing evidence shows that there was a medical or  practical need to use the nonparticipating hospital.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Factors that are not considered. CMS gives no consideration to  the following factors in determining whether the nonparticipating  hospital was the most accessible hospital:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The personal preference of the beneficiary, the physician, or  members of the family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fact that the attending physician did not have staff  privileges in a participating hospital which was available and the most  accessible to the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The location of previous medical records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conditions under which the accessibility requirement is met. If  a beneficiary must be taken to a hospital immediately for required  diagnosis and treatment, the nonparticipating hospital meets the  accessibility requirement if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It was the nearest hospital to the point where the emergency  occurred, it was medically equipped to handle the type of emergency, and  it was the most accessible, on the basis of the factors specified in  paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There was a closer participating hospital equipped to handle the  emergency, but the participating hospital did not have a bed available  or would not accept the individual.</p>
