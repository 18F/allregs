                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recovery of funds. VA may terminate a grant agreement with any RVCP grantee that does not comply with the terms of the RVCP agreement. VA may recover from the grantee any funds that are not used in accordance with a RVCP grant agreement. If VA decides to recover funds, VA will issue to the grantee a notice of intent to recover RVCP grant funds, and the grantee will then have 30 days beginning from the date of the notice to submit documentation demonstrating why the RVCP grant funds should not be recovered. If the RVCP grantee does not respond or if the grantee responds but VA determines the documentation is insufficient to establish compliance, VA will make a final determination as to whether action to recover the RVCP grant funds will be taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prohibition of further grants. When VA determines action will be taken to recover grant funds from a grantee, the

grantee will be prohibited from receiving any further RVCP grant funds for the duration of the pilot program.
