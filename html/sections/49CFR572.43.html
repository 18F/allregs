The acceleration-time curve for the test shall be unimodal and shall lie at or above the + 20g level for an interval not less than 3 milliseconds and not more than 7 milliseconds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test Procedure. (1) Adjust the dummy legs as specified in Sec. 572.44(f). Seat the dummy on a seating surface as specified in Sec. 572.44(h) with the limbs extended horizontally forward.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjust the dummy legs as specified in Sec. 572.44(f).
