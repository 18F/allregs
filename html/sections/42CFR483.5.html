                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Facility defined. For purposes of this subpart, facility means a skilled nursing facility (SNF) that meets the requirements of sections 1819(a), (b), (c), and (d) of the Act, or a nursing facility (NF) that meets the requirements of sections 1919(a), (b), (c), and (d) of the Act. ``Facility'' may include a distinct part of an institution (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section and specified in Sec. 440.40 and Sec. 440.155 of this chapter), but does not include an institution for individuals with intellectual disabilities or persons with related conditions described in Sec. 440.150 of this chapter. For Medicare and Medicaid purposes (including eligibility, coverage, certification, and payment), the ``facility'' is always the entity that participates in the program, whether that entity is comprised of all of, or a distinct part of, a larger institution. For Medicare, an SNF (see section 1819(a)(1) of the Act), and for Medicaid, an NF (see section 1919(a)(1) of the Act) may not be an institution for mental diseases as defined in Sec. 435.1010 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Distinct part--(1) Definition. A distinct part SNF or NF is physically distinguishable from the larger institution or institutional complex that houses it, meets the requirements of this paragraph and of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and meets the applicable statutory requirements for SNFs or NFs in sections 1819 or 1919 of the Act, respectively. A distinct part SNF or NF may be comprised of one or more buildings or designated parts of buildings (that is, wings, wards, or floors)

that are: In the same physical area immediately adjacent to the institution's main buildings; other areas and structures that are not strictly contiguous to the main buildings but are located within close proximity of the main buildings; and any other areas that CMS determines on an individual basis, to be part of the institution's campus. A distinct part must include all of the beds within the designated area, and cannot consist of a random collection of individual rooms or beds that are scattered throughout the physical plant. The term ``distinct part'' also includes a composite distinct part that meets the additional requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. A distinct part SNF or NF is physically distinguishable from the larger institution or institutional complex that houses it, meets the requirements of this paragraph and of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and meets the applicable statutory requirements for SNFs or NFs in sections 1819 or 1919 of the Act, respectively. A distinct part SNF or NF may be comprised of one or more buildings or designated parts of buildings (that is, wings, wards, or floors)

that are: In the same physical area immediately adjacent to the institution's main buildings; other areas and structures that are not strictly contiguous to the main buildings but are located within close proximity of the main buildings; and any other areas that CMS determines on an individual basis, to be part of the institution's campus. A distinct part must include all of the beds within the designated area, and cannot consist of a random collection of individual rooms or beds that are scattered throughout the physical plant. The term ``distinct part'' also includes a composite distinct part that meets the additional requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requirements. In addition to meeting the participation requirements for long-term care facilities set forth elsewhere in this subpart, a distinct part SNF or NF must meet all of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The SNF or NF must be operated under common ownership and control (that is, common governance) by the institution of which it is a distinct part, as evidenced by the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The SNF or NF is wholly owned by the institution of which it is a distinct part.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The SNF or NF is subject to the by-laws and operating decisions of a common governing body.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The institution of which the SNF or NF is a distinct part has final responsibility for the distinct part's administrative decisions and personnel policies, and final approval for the distinct part's personnel actions.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The SNF or NF functions as an integral and subordinate part of the institution of which it is a distinct part, with significant common resource usage of buildings, equipment, personnel, and services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The administrator of the SNF or NF reports to and is directly accountable to the management of the institution of which the SNF or NF is a distinct part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The SNF or NF must have a designated medical director who is responsible for implementing care policies and coordinating medical care, and who is directly accountable to the management of the institution of which it is a distinct part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The SNF or NF is financially integrated with the institution of which it is a distinct part, as evidenced by the sharing of income and expenses with that institution, and the reporting of its costs on that institution's cost report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A single institution can have a maximum of only one distinct part SNF and one distinct part NF.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> (A) An institution cannot designate a distinct part SNF or NF, but instead must submit a written request with documentation that demonstrates it meets the criteria set forth above to CMS to determine if it may be considered a distinct part.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An institution cannot designate a distinct part SNF or NF, but instead must submit a written request with documentation that demonstrates it meets the criteria set forth above to CMS to determine if it may be considered a distinct part.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The effective date of approval of a distinct part is the date that CMS determines all requirements (including enrollment with the fiscal intermediary (FI)) are met for approval, and cannot be made retroactive.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The institution must request approval from CMS for all proposed changes in the number of beds in the approved distinct part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Composite distinct part--(1) Definition. A composite distinct part is a distinct part consisting of two or more noncontiguous components that are not located within the same campus, as defined in Sec. 413.65(a)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. A composite distinct part is a distinct part consisting of two or more noncontiguous components that are not located within the same campus, as defined in Sec. 413.65(a)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requirements. In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, a composite distinct part must meet all of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A SNF or NF that is a composite of more than one location will be treated as a single distinct part of the institution of which it is a distinct part. As such, the composite distinct part will have only one provider agreement and only one provider number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If two or more institutions (each with a distinct part SNF or NF) undergo a change of ownership, CMS must approve the existing SNFs or NFs as meeting the requirements before they are considered a composite distinct part of a single institution. In making such a determination, CMS considers whether its approval or disapproval of a composite distinct part promotes the effective and efficient use of public monies without sacrificing the quality of care.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If there is a change of ownership of a composite distinct part SNF or NF, the assignment of the provider agreement to the new owner will apply to all of the approved locations that comprise the composite distinct part SNF or NF.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> To ensure quality of care and quality of life for all residents, the various components of a composite distinct part must meet all of the requirements for participation independently in each location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Common area. Common areas are dining rooms, activity rooms, meeting rooms where residents are located on a regular basis, and other areas in the facility where residents may gather together with other residents, visitors, and staff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fully sprinklered. A fully sprinklered long term care facility is one that has all areas sprinklered in accordance with National Fire Protection Association 13 ``Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems'' without the use of waivers or the Fire Safety Evaluation System.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Major modification means the modification of more than 50 percent, or more than 4,500 square feet, of the smoke compartment.
