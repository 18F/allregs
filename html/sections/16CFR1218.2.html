A sleep product that only has inclined sleeping surfaces (intended to be greater than 10[deg] from horizontal while in the rest (non-rocking) position) does not fall under the scope of this standard. If a product can be converted to a bassinet/cradle use mode and meets the definition of a bassinet/cradle found in 3.1.1 while in that mode, the product shall be included in the scope of this standard, when it is in the bassinet/cradle use mode. For example, strollers that have a carriage/bassinet feature are covered by the stroller/carriage standard when in the stroller use mode. Carriage baskets/bassinets that are removable from the stroller base are covered under the scope of this standard when the carriage basket/bassinet meets the definition of a bassinet/cradle found in 3.1.1.

Bassinets with Segmented Mattresses: Flatness Test--If the bassinet or bassinet accessory has a folding or segmented mattress, or both, any angle when measured in 7.8 less than or equal to 10[deg] is an immediate pass. Any angle when measured in 7.8 greater than 10[deg] is an immediate failure. Segmented bassinet mattresses that have seams (located between segments or where the mattress folds) that are less than 15 inches in length are excluded from this requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In addition to complying with section 6.9.2 of ASTM F2194-13, comply with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 6.10. Removable Bassinet Bed Attachment--Any product containing a removable bassinet bed with a latching or locking device intended to secure the bassinet bed to the base/stand, shall comply with at least one of the following 6.10.1, 6.10.2, 6.10.3, 6.10.4 or 6.10.5 when tested in accordance with 7.12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 6.10.1. The base/stand shall not support the bassinet bed (i.e., the bassinet bed falls from the stand and contacts the floor or the base/stand collapses when the bassinet bed is not locked on the base/stand).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 6.10.2. The lock/latch shall automatically engage under the weight of the bassinet bed (without any other force or action) in all lateral positions (Figure 24).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> 6.10.3. The sleep surface of the bassinet bed shall be at an angle of at least 20[deg] from a horizontal plane when the bassinet bed is in an unlocked position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> 6.10.4. The bassinet/cradle shall provide a false latch/lock visual indicator(s). At a minimum, an indicator

shall be visible to a person standing near both of the two longest sides of the product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> 6.10.5.

Place the CAMI Newborn Dummy, Mark II, on the sleeping pad in the center of the product face up with the arms and legs straightened.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Rationale. The newborn CAMI dummy represents a 50th percentile newborn infant, which is a more appropriate user of a bassinet than the CAMI infant dummy, which represents a 50th percentile 6-month-old infant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> In addition to complying with section 7.11.4 of ASTM F2194-13, comply with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 7.12. Removable Bassinet Bed Attachment Tests</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 7.12.1. Assemble the bassinet/cradle base/stand only, in accordance with manufacturer's instructions in one of the manufacturer's recommended use positions. If the base/stand does not remain in the use position when the bassinet bed is not locked onto it, the product meets the requirements of 6.10.1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 7.12.2. Place the base/stand and the inclinometer on a flat level horizontal surface (0  -0.5[deg]) to establish a test plane. Zero the inclinometer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> 7.12.3. Remove the mattress pad from the bassinet bed.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (b)(7)(iv): For mattresses that are integral with the mattress support, do not remove the mattress and perform all angle measurements for 7.12 on a 6 by 6 by \3/8\-in. nominal aluminum block placed on the center of the mattress.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> 7.12.4. Place the bassinet bed on the base/stand in the intended use orientation without engaging any latch or lock mechanism between the base/stand and the bassinet bed. If the bed automatically engages to the base/stand do not disengage the lock/latch. If the bassinet bed can rest on the base/stand in its intended use orientation in one or more lateral unlocked position (Figure 24), the unit shall be evaluated in the lateral position most likely to fail the requirements specified in 6.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Figure 24: Bassinet Bed Resting on Stand, Showing Possible Alternate Lateral Positions.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23OC13.001</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> 7.12.4.1. If the base/stand supports the bassinet bed in any unlocked position, place the inclinometer on the mattress support at the approximate center of the mattress support. Care should be taken to avoid seams, snap fasteners, or other items that may affect the measurement reading. Record the angle measurement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> 7.12.4.2. If the base/stand supports the bassinet bed and the angle of the mattress support surface measured in 7.12.4.1 is less than 20 degrees from a horizontal plane, evaluate whether the bassinet has a false latch/lock visual indicator per 6.10.4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> 7.12.4.3. If the base/stand supports the bassinet bed, and the angle of the mattress support surface measured in 7.12.4.1 is less than 20 degrees from a horizontal plane, and the bassinet does not contain a false latch/lock visual indicator, test the unit in accordance with sections 7.4.2 through 7.4.7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> 7.12.5. Repeat 7.12.2 through 7.12.4 for all of the manufacturer's base/stand recommended positions and use modes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> 7.12.6. Repeat 7.12.4 through 7.12.5 with the bassinet bed rotated 180 degrees from the manufacturers recommended use orientation, if the base/stand supports the bassinet bed in this orientation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Rationale. (1) This test requirement addresses fatal and nonfatal incidents involving bassinet beds that tipped over or fell off their base/stand when they were not properly locked/latched to their base/stand or the latch failed to engage as intended. Products that appear to be in an intended use position when the lock or latch is not properly engaged can create a false sense of security by appearing to be stable. Unsecured or misaligned lock/latch systems are a hidden hazard because they are not easily seen by consumers due to being located beneath the bassinet or covered by decorative skirts. In addition, consumers will avoid activating lock/latch mechanisms for numerous reasons if a bassinet bed appears stable when placed on a stand/base. Because of these foreseeable use conditions, this requirement has been added to ensure that bassinets with a removable bassinet bed feature will be inherently stable or it is obvious that they are not properly secured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 6.10 allows bassinet bed designs that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cannot be supported by the base/stand in an unlocked configuration,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Automatically lock and cannot be placed in an unlocked position on the base/stand,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Are clearly and obviously unstable when the lock/latch is misaligned or unused,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provide a visual warning to consumers when the product is not properly locked onto the base/stand, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Have lock/latch mechanisms that are not necessary to provide needed stability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]
