The Regional Administrator will evaluate  an application submitted during the specified application period and  compare all claims in the application with the information in the  official LLP record. Claims in the application that are consistent with  information in the official LLP record will be accepted by the Regional  Administrator. Inconsistent claims in the application, unless verified  by evidence, will not be accepted. An applicant who submits inconsistent  claims, or an applicant who fails to submit the information specified in  paragraphs (g)(4)(iii) and (g)(4)(iv) of this section, will be provided  a 60-day evidentiary period pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(vii) of this  section to submit the specified information, submit evidence to verify  his or her inconsistent claims, or submit a revised application with  claims consistent with information in the official LLP record. An  applicant who submits claims that are inconsistent with information in  the official LLP record has the burden of proving that the submitted  claims are correct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Additional information or evidence. The Regional Administrator  will evaluate additional information or evidence to support an  applicant's inconsistent claims submitted within the 60-day evidentiary  period pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(vii) of this section. If the  Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or  evidence meets the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent  claims in his or her application are correct, the official LLP record  will be amended and the information will be used in determining whether  the applicant is eligible for a license. However, if the Regional  Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence  does not meet the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent  claims in his or her application is correct, the applicant will be  notified by an initial administrative determination, pursuant to  paragraph (g)(4)(viii) of this section, that the applicant did not meet  the burden of proof to change the information in the official LLP  record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> 60-day evidentiary period.

Also, an applicant who  fails to submit information as specified in paragraphs (g)(4)(iii) and  (g)(4)(iv) of this section will have 60 days to provide that  information. An applicant will be limited to one 60-day evidentiary  period. Additional information or evidence, or a revised application,  received after the 60-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has  expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial  administrative determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Initial administrative determinations (IAD). The Regional  Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following  the expiration of the 60-day evidentiary period if the Regional  Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by  the applicant fails to support the applicant's claims and is  insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official LLP record is  correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised  application is not provided within the time period specified in the  letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 60-day evidentiary  period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies in   the application, including any deficiencies with the information, the  evidence submitted in support of the information, or the revised  application. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved  based on the available information or evidence. An applicant who  receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to Sec. 679.43. An applicant who  avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD will not  receive a transferable license until after the final resolution of that  appeal in the applicant's favor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Issuance of a non-transferable license. The Regional  Administrator will issue a non-transferable license to the applicant at  the same time notification is provided to the applicant of his or her  60-day evidentiary period if issuance is required by the license renewal  provisions of 5 U.S.C. 558. A non-transferable license authorizes a  person to catch and retain scallops as specified on the non-transferable  license, and will have the specific endorsements and designations based  on the claims in his or her application. A non-transferable license will  expire upon final agency action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Transfer of a Scallop License--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General.

A person who holds a groundfish  license or a crab species license with a catcher/processor vessel  designation may, upon request to the Regional Administrator, have the  license reissued with a catcher vessel designation. The vessel  designation change to a catcher vessel will be permanent, and that  license will be valid for only those activities specified in the  definition of catcher vessel designation at Sec. 679.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Limited processing by catcher vessels. Up to 1 mt of round  weight equivalent of license limitation groundfish or crab species may  be processed per day on a vessel less than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m)  LOA that is authorized to fish with an LLP license with a catcher vessel  designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Vessel length categories. A vessel's eligibility will be  determined using the following three vessel length categories, which are  based on the vessel's LOA on June 17, 1995, or, if the vessel was under  reconstruction on June 17, 1995, the vessel's length on the date that  reconstruction was completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Vessel length category ``A'' if the LOA of the qualifying vessel  on the relevant date was equal to or greater than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Vessel length category ``B'' if the LOA of the qualifying vessel  on the relevant date was equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) but  less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Vessel length category ``C'' if the LOA of the qualifying vessel  on the relevant date was less than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Gear designations for groundfish licenses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General. A  vessel may only use gear consistent with the gear designation on the LLP  license authorizing the use of that vessel to fish for license  limitation groundfish or crab species, except that a vessel fishing  under authority of an LLP license endorsed only for trawl gear may fish  for slope rockfish with non-trawl gear within the Gulf of Alaska Slope  Habitat Conservation Areas, as described in Table 27 to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Trawl/non-trawl. A license will be assigned a trawl/non-trawl  gear designation if trawl and non-trawl gear were used to harvest LLP  species from the qualifying vessel during the period beginning January  1, 1988, through June 17, 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Trawl. A license will be assigned a trawl gear designation if  only trawl gear was used to harvest LLP species from the qualifying  vessel during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through June 17,  1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Non-trawl. A license will be assigned a non-trawl gear  designation if only non-trawl gear was used to harvest LLP species from  the qualifying   vessel during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through June 17,  1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Changing a gear designation. (1) An applicant may request a  change of gear designation based on gear used from the vessel during the  period beginning June 18, 1995, through February 7, 1998. Such a change  would be permanent and may only be used for a change from trawl to non- trawl or from non-trawl to trawl.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An applicant may request a change of gear designation based on a  significant financial investment in converting a vessel or purchasing  fishing gear on or before February 7, 1998, and making a documented  harvest with that gear on or before December 31, 1998. Such a change  would be permanent and may only be used for a change from trawl to non- trawl or from non-trawl to trawl.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Definitions of non-trawl gear and significant financial  investment. (1) For purposes of paragraph (k)(3)(iv) of this section,  non-trawl gear means any legal gear, other than trawl, used to harvest  license limitation groundfish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section,  ``significant financial investment'' means having spent at least  $100,000 toward vessel conversion and/or gear to change to trawl gear  from non-trawl gear, or having acquired groundline, hooks, pots, jig  machines, or hauling equipment to change to non-trawl gear from trawl  gear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(ii)</em> of this section. For purposes of the  license limitation program, evidence of a documented harvest must be  demonstrated by a state catch report, a Federal catch report, or other  valid documentation that indicates the amount of license limitation  groundfish harvested, the groundfish reporting area in which the license  limitation groundfish was harvested, the vessel and gear type used to  harvest the license limitation groundfish, and the date of harvesting,  landing, or reporting. State catch reports are Alaska, California,  Oregon, or Washington fish tickets.

A license  cannot be endorsed for more than one area, notwithstanding the fact that  the applicant may have the documented harvests to qualify for more than  one endorsement area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Unavoidable circumstances. If a person is claiming that  unavoidable circumstances prevented him or her from meeting certain  eligibility requirements for a license under paragraph (k) of this  section, he or she must provide the information required in the  particular paragraph of this section authorizing such a claim, and  include valid evidence of the date the vessel was lost, damaged, or  otherwise unable to participate in the fishery, and the date a  documented harvest was made after the vessel was unable to participate  in the fishery by the unavoidable circumstance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Application evaluation. The Regional Administrator will evaluate  an application submitted during the specified application period and  compare all claims in the application with the information in the  official LLP record. Claims in the application that are consistent with  information in the official LLP record will be accepted by the Regional  Administrator. Inconsistent claims in the application, unless verified  by evidence, will not be accepted. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(6)(vii) of  this section, an applicant who submits inconsistent claims, or an  applicant who fails to submit the information specified in paragraphs  (k)(6)(iii) and (k)(6)(iv) of this section, will be provided a 60-day  evidentiary period pursuant to paragraph (k)(6)(vii) of this section to  submit the specified information, submit evidence to verify his or her  inconsistent claims, or submit a revised application with claims  consistent with information in the official LLP record. An applicant who  submits claims that are inconsistent with information in the official  LLP record has the burden of proving that the submitted claims are  correct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Additional information or evidence. The Regional Administrator  will evaluate additional information or evidence to support an  applicant's inconsistent claims submitted within the 60-day evidentiary  period pursuant to paragraph (k)(6)(vii) of this section. If the  Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or  evidence meets the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent  claims in his or her application is correct, the official LLP record  will be amended and the information will be used in determining whether  the applicant is eligible for a license. However, if the Regional  Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence  does not meet the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent  claims in his or her application is correct, the applicant will be  notified by an initial administrative determination, pursuant to  paragraph (k)(6)(viii) of this section, that the applicant did not meet  the burden of proof to change the information in the official LLP  record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> 60-day evidentiary period. The Regional Administrator will  specify by letter a 60-day evidentiary period during which an applicant  may provide additional information or evidence to support the claims  made in his or her application, or to submit a revised application with  claims consistent with information in the official LLP record, if the  Regional Administrator determines that the applicant did not meet the  burden of proving that the information on the application is correct  through evidence provided with the application. Also, an applicant who  fails to submit information as specified in paragraphs (k)(6)(iii) and  (k)(6)(iv) of this section will have 60 days to provide that  information. An applicant will be limited to one 60-day evidentiary  period. Additional information or evidence, or a revised application,  received after the 60-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has  expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial  administrative determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Initial administrative determinations (IAD). The Regional  will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration  of the 60-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator  determines that the information or evidence provided by the applicant  fails to support the applicant's claims and is insufficient to rebut the  presumption that the official LLP record is correct, or if the  additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided  within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the  applicant of his or her 60-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate  the deficiencies in the application,   including any deficiencies with the information, the evidence submitted  in support of the information, or the revised application. The IAD will  also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available  information or evidence. An applicant who receives an IAD may appeal  pursuant to Sec. 679.43. An applicant who avails himself or herself of  the opportunity to appeal an IAD will not receive a transferable license  until after the final resolution of that appeal, notwithstanding the  eligibility of that applicant for some claims based on consistent  information in the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Issuance of a non-transferable license. The Regional  Administrator will issue a non-transferable license to the applicant on  issuance of an IAD if required by the license renewal provisions of 5  U.S.C. 558. A non-transferable license authorizes a person to deploy a  vessel to conduct directed fishing for license limitation groundfish or  crab species as specified on the non-transferable license, and will have  the specific endorsements and designations based on the claims in his or  her application. A non-transferable license will expire upon final  agency action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Surrender of groundfish or crab LLP. A groundfish or crab LLP  license may be voluntarily surrendered in accordance with paragraph  (a)(9) of this section. A surrendered groundfish or crab LLP license  will cease to exist and will not be subsequently reissued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Surrender and extinguishment of a groundfish LLP endorsement.  Endorsements specified on a groundfish LLP license are not severable  from a license and cannot be surrendered except that pot gear Pacific  cod endorsements specified on groundfish LLP licenses listed in Column C  of Table 9 to this part, can be permanently surrendered, removed, and  extinguished if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The holder of the groundfish LLP license listed in Column C of  Table 9 to this part requests, in writing, that NMFS permanently remove  and extinguish all pot gear Pacific cod endorsements specified on that  LLP license and acknowledges in that written request that the surrender  and removal are permanent and irreversible and that all pot gear Pacific  cod endorsements on that LLP license are extinguished;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The holder of the groundfish LLP license listed in Column C of  Table 9 to this part requests, in writing, that NMFS assign a 220-foot  (67 m) MLOA on that LLP license;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The holder of the eligible LLP license, or the authorized agent,  signs the request;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> NMFS receives the written request to permanently remove and  extinguish all pot gear Pacific cod endorsements specified on the LLP  groundfish license by February 6, 2017; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The written request is submitted to NMFS using one of the  following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mail: Regional Administrator, c/o Restricted Access Management  Program, NMFS, P.O.

The Regional Administrator will transfer a groundfish license,  Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph  (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section, or a crab species license if a complete  transfer application is submitted to Restricted Access Management,  Alaska Region, NMFS, and if the transfer meets the eligibility criteria  as specified in paragraph (k)(7)(ii) of this section. A transfer  application form may be requested from the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Eligibility criteria for transfers. A groundfish license,  Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph  (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section, or crab species license can be  transferred if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The designated transferee is eligible to document a fishing  vessel under Chapter 121, Title 46, U.S.C.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The parties to the transfer do not have any fines, civil  penalties, other payments due and outstanding, or outstanding permit  sanctions resulting from Federal fishing violations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The transfer will not cause the designated transferee to exceed  the license caps in Sec. 679.7(i); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The transfer does not violate any other provision specified in  this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Contents of application. To be complete, an application for a  groundfish license, Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under  paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section transfer, or a crab species  license transfer must be legible, have notarized and dated signatures of  the applicants, and the applicants must attest that, to the best of the  applicant's knowledge, all statements in the application are true. An  application to transfer will be provided by NMFS, or is available on the  NMFS Alaska Region website at http://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov. The  acceptable submittal methods will be specified on the application form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Incomplete applications. The Regional Administrator will return  an incomplete transfer application to the applicant and identify any  deficiencies if the Regional Administrator determines that the  application does not meet all the criteria identified in paragraph  (k)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Transfer by court order, operation of law, or as part of a  security agreement. The Regional Administrator will transfer a  groundfish license, Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under  paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section, or a crab species license  based on a court order, operation of law, or a security agreement if the  Regional Administrator determines that the transfer application is  complete and the transfer will not violate any of the provisions of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Voluntary transfer limitation. A groundfish license, Aleutian  Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of  this section, or a crab species license may be voluntarily transferred  only once in any calendar year. A voluntary transfer is a transfer other  than one pursuant to a court order, operation of law, or a security  agreement. An application for transfer that would cause a person to  exceed the transfer limit of this provision will not be approved. A  transfer of an Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under  paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section to another LLP license, or the  transfer of a groundfish license with an Aleutian Island area  endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section  attached to it will be considered to be a transfer of that Aleutian  Island area endorsement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Request to change the designated vessel. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A request to  change the vessel designated on an LLP groundfish or crab species  license must be made on a transfer application.

The MLOA modification specified at paragraph  (k)(3)(i)(C) of this section will be effective when a complete  application is submitted to NMFS in accordance with paragraph (k)(7) of  this section, and the application is approved by the Regional  Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Severability of licenses. (A) Area endorsements or area/ species endorsements specified on a license are not severable from the  license and must be transferred together, except that Aleutian Island  area endorsements on a groundfish license with a trawl gear designation  issued under the provisions of paragraph (k)(4)(ix)(A) of this section  and that are assigned to a groundfish license with an MLOA of less than  60 feet LOA may be transferred separately from the groundfish license to  which that Aleutian Island area endorsement was originally issued to  another groundfish license provided that the groundfish license to which  that Aleutian Island endorsement is transferred:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Was not derived in whole or in part from the qualifying fishing  history of an AFA vessel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Has a catcher vessel designation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Has a trawl gear designation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Has an MLOA of less than 60 feet LOA; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A complete transfer application is submitted to the Regional  Administrator as described under this paragraph (k)(7), and that  application is approved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A groundfish license and a crab species license issued based on  the legal landings of the same vessel and initially issued to the same  qualified person are not severable and must be transferred together.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Other transfer restrictions. The transfer of a LLP license that  was issued based on the documented harvests from a vessel that did not  have an FFP during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through October  8, 1998, must be accompanied by the vessel from which the documented  harvests were made or its replacement vessel, or if the LLP license and  vessel were separated by transfer prior to February 7, 1998, then by the  vessel that is currently being deployed by the license holder. The  Regional Administrator will deny a transfer application that requests  the transfer of a LLP license that was issued based on the documented  harvests from a vessel that did not have an FFP during the period  beginning January 1, 1988, through October 8, 1998, if the appropriate  vessel is not being transferred as part of the same transaction. A  license holder of an LLP license that was issued based on the documented  harvests from a vessel that did not have an FFP during the period  beginning January 1, 1988, through October 8, 1998, may replace the  vessel from which the documented harvests were made with another vessel  that meets the vessel designation and MLOA requirements specified on the  LLP license if the original qualifying vessel is lost or destroyed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Other provisions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any person committing, or a fishing vessel  used in the commission of, a violation of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery  Conservation and Management Act or any regulations issued pursuant  thereto, is subject to the civil and criminal penalty provisions and the  civil forfeiture provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation  and Management Act, part 621 of this chapter, 15 CFR part 904 (Civil  Procedure), and other applicable law.
