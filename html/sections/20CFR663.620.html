WIA participants who  are also determined WtW eligible, may be referred to the WtW operator  for job placement and other WtW assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The local TANF agency is specifically suggested under WIA as an  additional partner in the One-Stop system. TANF recipients will have  access to more information about employment opportunities and services  when the TANF agency participates in the One-Stop delivery system. The  Governor and Local Board should encourage the TANF agency to become a  One-Stop partner to improve the quality of services to the WtW and TANF- eligible populations. In addition, becoming a One-Stop partner will  ensure that the TANF agency is represented on the Local Board and  participates in developing workforce investment strategies that help  cash assistance recipients secure lasting employment.</p>
