                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. (1) The collection of an assessment under section 6851, 6861, or 6862 (referred to as a ``jeopardy assessment'' for purposes of this section), or under section 6852 (referred to as a political assessment for purposes of this section) of any tax may be stayed by filing with the district director a bond on the form to be furnished by the district director upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The collection of an assessment under section 6851, 6861, or 6862 (referred to as a ``jeopardy assessment'' for purposes of this section), or under section 6852 (referred to as a political assessment for purposes of this section) of any tax may be stayed by filing with the district director a bond on the form to be furnished by the district director upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The bond may be filed--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At any time before the time collection by levy is authorized under section 6331(a), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After collection by levy is authorized and before levy is made on any property or rights to property, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the discretion of the district director, after any such levy has been made and before the expiration of the period of limitations on collection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The bond must be in an amount equal to the portion (including interest thereon to the date of payment as calculated by the district director) of the jeopardy assessment or political assessment collection of which is sought to be stayed. See section 7101 and Sec. 301.7101-1, relating to the form of bond and the sureties thereon. The bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of the amount (together with interest thereon), the collection of which is stayed, at the time at which, but for the making of the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon the filing of a bond in accordance with this section, the collection of so much of the assessment as is covered by the bond will be stayed. The taxpayer may at any time waive the stay of collection of the whole or any part of the amount covered by the bond. If as a result of such waiver any part of the amount covered by the bond is paid, or if any portion of the jeopardy assessment or political assessment is abated by the district director, then the bond shall be at the request of the taxpayer be proportionately reduced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional conditions applicable to income, estate, gift, and chapter 41, 42, 43 and 44 tax assessments. In the case of jeopardy assessment or political assessment of income, estate, gift, chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 tax, the bond must be conditioned upon the payment of so much of the amount included therein as is not abated by a decision of the Tax Court which has become final, together with the interest on such amount. If the Tax Court determines that the amount assessed is greater than the correct amount of the tax, the bond will be proportionately reduced at the request of the taxpayer after the Tax Court renders its decision. If the bond is given before the taxpayer has filed his petition with the Tax Court, it must contain a further condition that if a petition is not filed before the expiration of the period provided in section 6213(a) for the filing of such petition the amount stayed by the bond will be paid upon notice and demand at any time after the expiration of such period, together with interest thereon at the annual rate referred to in the regulations under section 6621 from the date of the jeopardy (or political assessment) notice and demand to the date of the notice and demand made after the expiration of the period for filing petition with the Tax Court.
