                            <p class="depth0">Unless supplemented in a RFP, the criteria listed in this section will be used to evaluate grants under this subpart. The distribution of points to be awarded per criterion will be identified in the applicable RFP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ability to Deliver. The application will be evaluated as to whether it evidences unique abilities to deliver Producer Services so as to create sustainable Value-Added ventures. Abilities that are transferable to a wide range of agricultural Value-Added commodities are preferred over highly specialized skills. Strong skills must be accompanied by a credible and thoughtful plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Successful Track Record. The applicant's track record in achieving Value-Added successes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Work Plan/Budget. The work plan will be reviewed for detailed actions and an accompanying timetable for implementing the proposal. Clear, logical, realistic and efficient plans will result in a higher score. Budgets will be reviewed for completeness and the strength of non-Federal funding commitments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Qualifications of personnel. Proposals will be reviewed for whether the key personnel who are to be responsible for performing the proposed tasks have the necessary qualifications and whether they have a track record of performing activities similar to those being proposed. If a consultant or others are to be hired, points may be awarded for consultants only if the proposal includes evidence of their availability and commitment as well. Proposals using in-house employees with strong track records in innovative activities will receive higher points relative to proposals that out-source expertise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Local support. Proposed Centers must show local support and coordination with other developmental organizations in the proposed service area and with state and local institutions. Support documentation should include recognition of rural values that balance employment opportunities with environmental stewardship and other rural amenities. Proposed Centers that show strong support from potential

beneficiaries and coordination with other developmental organizations will receive more points than those not evidencing such support.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Future support. Applicants that can demonstrate their vision for funding center operations for future years, including diversification of funding sources and building in-house technical assistance capacity, will receive more points for this criterion.</p>
