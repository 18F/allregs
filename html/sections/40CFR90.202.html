                            <p class="depth0">The definitions in subpart A of this part apply to this subpart. The  following definitions also apply to this subpart:</p><p class="depth0">Averaging means the exchange of emission credits between engine  families within a given manufacturer's product line.</p><p class="depth0">Banking means the retention of emission credits by the manufacturer  generating the emission credits or obtaining such credits through  trading, for use in future model year averaging or trading as permitted  in this part.</p><p class="depth0">Emission credits represent the amount of emission reduction or  exceedance, by an engine family, below or above the applicable  HC+NOX (NMHC+NOX) emission standard, respectively.  FELs below the standard create ``positive credits,'' while FELs above  the standard create ``negative credits.'' In addition, ``projected  credits'' refer to emission credits based on the projected applicable  production volume of the engine family. ``Reserved credits'' are  emission credits generated within a model year waiting to be reported to  EPA at the end of the model year. ``Actual credits'' refer to emission  credits based on actual applicable production volume as contained in the  end-of-year reports submitted to EPA. Some or all of these credits may  be revoked if EPA review of the end-of-year reports or any subsequent  audit action(s) reveals problems or errors of any nature with credit  computations.</p><p class="depth0">Trading means the exchange of emission credits between  manufacturers.</p>
