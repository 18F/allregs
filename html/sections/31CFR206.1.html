These objectives seek to improve funds availability and the efficiency and effectiveness with which funds are transferred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Authority to implement this regulation has been delegated within the Department of the Treasury (hereinafter, ``Treasury'') to the Commissioner (hereinafter, ``the Commissioner'') of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (hereinafter, ``the Service).'' The Service maintains the final authority as granted under the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 to specify use of a particular method or mechanism of collection and deposit and to recover costs that result from noncompliance. Authority is also granted to the Service, under the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990, as amended by the Cash Management Improvement Act Amendments of 1992, to provide for the timely disbursement of funds. An agency will require the collection or disbursement of funds by the agency via EFT as a provision of new contractual agreements or renewal of existing
