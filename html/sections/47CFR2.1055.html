                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The frequency stability shall be measured with variation of  ambient temperature as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From -30 to + 50 centigrade for all equipment except that  specified in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From -20 to + 50 centigrade for equipment to be licensed for  use in the Maritime Services under part 80 of this chapter, except for  Class A, B, and S Emergency Position Indicating Radiobeacons (EPIRBS),  and equipment to be licensed for use above 952 MHz at operational fixed  stations in all services, stations in the Local Television Transmission  Service and Point-to-Point Microwave Radio Service under part 21 of this  chapter, equipment licensed for use aboard aircraft in the Aviation  Services under part 87 of this chapter, and equipment authorized for use  in the Family Radio Service under part 95 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> From 0 to + 50 centigrade for equipment to be licensed for use  in the Radio Broadcast Services under part 73 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Frequency measurements shall be made at the extremes of the  specified temperature range and at intervals of not more than 10  centigrade through the range. A period of time sufficient to stabilize  all of the components of the oscillator circuit at each temperature  level shall be allowed prior to frequency measurement. The short term  transient effects on the frequency of the transmitter due to keying  (except for broadcast transmitters) and any heating element cycling  normally occurring at each ambient temperature level also shall be  shown. Only the portion or portions of the transmitter containing the  frequency determining and stabilizing circuitry need be subjected to the  temperature variation test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to all other requirements of this section, the  following information is required for equipment incorporating heater  type crystal oscillators to be used in mobile stations, for which type  acceptance is first requested after March 25, 1974, except for battery  powered, hand carried, portable equipment having less than 3 watts mean  output power.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measurement data showing variation in transmitter output  frequency from a cold start and the elapsed time necessary for the  frequency to stabilize within the applicable tolerance. Tests shall be  made after temperature stabilization at each of the ambient temperature  levels; the lower temperature limit, 0 centigrade and + 30 centigrade  with no primary power applied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Beginning at each temperature level specified in paragraph  (c)(1) of this section, the frequency shall be measured within one  minute after application of primary power to the transmitter and at  intervals of no more than one minute thereafter until ten minutes have  elapsed or until sufficient measurements are obtained to indicate  clearly that the frequency has stabilized within the applicable  tolerance, whichever time period is greater. During each test, the  ambient temperature shall not be allowed to rise more than 10  centigrade above the respective beginning ambient temperature level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The elapsed time necessary for the frequency to stabilize within  the applicable tolerance from each beginning ambient temperature level  as determined from the tests specified in this paragraph shall be  specified in the instruction book for the transmitter furnished to the  user.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When it is impracticable to subject the complete transmitter to  this test because of its physical dimensions or power rating, only its  frequency determining and stabilizing portions need be tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The frequency stability shall be measured with variation of  primary supply voltage as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vary primary supply voltage from 85 to 115 percent of the  nominal value for other than hand carried battery equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For hand carried, battery powered equipment, reduce primary  supply voltage to the battery operating end point which shall be  specified by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The supply voltage shall be measured at the input to the cable  normally provided with the equipment, or at the power supply terminals  if cables are not normally provided. Effects on frequency of transmitter  keying (except for broadcast transmitters) and any heating element  cycling at the nominal supply voltage and at each extreme also shall be  shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When deemed necessary, the Commission may require tests of  frequency stability under conditions in addition to those specifically  set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section. (For  example measurements showing the effect of proximity to large metal  objects, or of various types of antennas, may be required for portable  equipment.)
