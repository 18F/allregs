                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 5307(d), as added by section  1322 of the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 (Title XIII of  Public Law 107-296, the Homeland Security Act of 2002; November 25,  2002), which provides a higher aggregate limitation on pay for certain  members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) under 5 U.S.C. 5382 and  5383 and employees in senior-level (SL) and scientific or professional  (ST) positions paid under 5 U.S.C. 5376. In addition, this subpart is  necessary to administer rates of basic pay for members of the SES under  5 U.S.C. 5382, as amended by section 1125 of the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004. The regulations in this subpart  strengthen the application of pay-for-performance principles to senior  executives and senior professionals. Specifically, the statutory  provisions authorize an agency to apply a higher maximum rate of basic  pay for senior executives (consistent with 5 CFR part 534, subpart D,  when effective) and apply a higher aggregate limitation on pay  (consistent with 5 CFR part 530, subpart B) to its senior employees, but  only after OPM, with OMB   concurrence, has certified that the design and application of the  agency's appraisal systems for these employees make meaningful  distinctions based on relative performance. This subpart establishes the  certification criteria and procedures that OPM will apply in considering  agency requests for such certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b))</em>.</p>
