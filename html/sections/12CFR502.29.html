                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the most recent examination rating assigned to the responsible savings and loan holding company (or most recent examination rating assigned to any savings and loan holding company in the holding company structure) is a composite rating of 4 or 5, OTS will assess a charge under the condition component. The amount of the condition component is equal to 100 percent of the sum of the base assessment amount, the risk/complexity component, and any organizational form component.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purposes of this section, examination ratings are the ratings that OTS assigns under the OTS holding company rating system. OTS uses the most recent rating of which the savings and loan holding company has been notified in writing before an assessment's due date.
