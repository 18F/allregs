                            <p class="depth0">Any interested person or organization may file a petition to  intervene which will include a statement of position and a statement of  what petitioner expects to contribute to the hearing, and a copy of the  petition will be served on all parties. Such petition should be filed  prior to the prehearing conference, or if none is held, before the  commencement of the hearing, unless the petitioner shows good cause for  filing the petition later. The hearing officer may grant the petition if  he believes that such participation will not unduly delay a hearing and  will contribute materially to the proceeding. An intervener is not a  party and may not introduce evidence at a hearing, or propound questions  to a witness, unless the hearing officer determines that the proposed  additional evidence is relevant and will clarify the facts. The  intervener may submit and serve on all parties a brief in support or  opposition to any brief of a party. All service and notice required by  and upon a party shall apply to an intervener.</p>
