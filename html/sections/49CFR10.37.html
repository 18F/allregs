                            <p class="depth0">No record or information contained in a system of records is  disclosed to an individual nor is any correction of a record in  accordance with subpart E made at the request of an individual unless  that individual demonstrates that he or she is who he or she claims to  be. Normally, identity can be proven for individuals who appear in  person by the presentation of an identifying document issued by a  recognized organization (e.g., a driver's license or a credit card) and  which contains a means of verification such as a photograph or a  signature. For requests by mail, the unique identifier used in the  system should be included if known. Responses to mail requests are  normally sent only to the name and address listed in the system of  records. In the case of particularly sensitive records, additional  identification requirements may be imposed. In such cases, these  additional requirements are listed in the public notice for the system.  [45 FR 8993, Feb. 11, 1980, as amended at 62 FR 23667, May 1, 1997]</p>
