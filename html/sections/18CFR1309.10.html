A recipient also has responsibility to maintain records, provide information, and afford TVA access to its records to the extent required by TVA to determine whether the recipient is in compliance with the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> TVA has responsibility to attempt to secure a recipient's compliance with the Act by voluntary means, to the fullest extent practicable, and to provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily. TVA may use the services of appropriate Federal, State, local, or private organizations for this purpose.

TVA also has the responsibility to enforce the Act when a recipient fails to eliminate violations of the Act.
