                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you exclusively use divers to examine the underwater hull plating, you must arrange to have a preliminary examination conducted by a third party examiner, with the assistance of qualified divers. The purpose of the preliminary examination is to assess the overall condition of the vessel's hull and identify any specific concerns to be addressed during the underwater hull examination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you use an underwater ROV as the predominate means to examine your vessel's hull plating, a preliminary examination and the participation of a third party examiner will not be necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The preliminary examination is required only upon the vessel's entry or review into the AHE program.
