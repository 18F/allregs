Such interrogatory shall state  the nature of   the evidence against him, setting forth with particularity the facts and  circumstances involved, in as much detail as security conditions permit,  in order to enable him to submit his answer, defense or explanation and  to submit affidavits. It will also inform the applicant or employee, of  his opportunity to reply to the interrogatory in writing, under oath or  affirmation, within ten (10) calendar days of the date of receipt by him  of the interrogatory or such longer time as the Board in specific cases  may prescribe, and of his opportunity for a hearing on the issues before  the Board or a panel of the Board, including his right to appear  personally at such hearing, to be represented by counsel of a  representative of his own choosing, to present evidence in his own  behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses offered in support of the  derogatory information.</p>
