                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applications for International station facilities are divided into two groups.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the first group are applications for new stations, or for major changes in the facilities of authorized stations. A major change is any change in or addition to authorized zones or areas of reception, any change in transmitter location other than one in the immediate vicinity of existing antennas of the station, or any change in power, or antenna directivity. However, the FCC may, within 15 days after the acceptance for filing of any other application for modification, advise the applicant that such application is considered to be one for a major change and therefore is subject to Sec. Sec.  1.1111 and 73.3580 pertaining to major changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The second group consists of applications for licenses and all other

changes in the facilities of authorized stations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an application is amended so as to effect a major change as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or so as to result in an assignment or transfer of control which, in the case of an authorized station, would require the filing of an application therefor on FCC Form 314 or 315 (see Sec.  73.3540), Sec.  73.3580 will apply to such amended application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applications for International stations will be processed as nearly as possible in the order in which they are filed.
