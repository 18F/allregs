                            <p class="depth0">No. Your permit or lease gives you an exclusive right to the mineral, but not to the lands. BLM may allow other uses or disposal of the lands, including leasing of other minerals, if those uses or disposals will not unreasonably interfere with your operation. If BLM issues other permits or leases covering the lands contained within your permit or lease, they will contain suitable stipulations for simultaneous operation based on consideration of safety, environmental protection, conservation, ultimate recovery of the resource, and other factors. You must also make all reasonable efforts to avoid interference with other authorized uses. In cases where the date of the lease is used to determine priority for development and a lease is renewed, BLM will use the effective date of the original lease to determine priority for development.</p>
