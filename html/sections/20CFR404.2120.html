The State or alternate participant shall permit us and  the Comptroller General of the United States (including duly authorized  representatives) access to and the right to examine records relating to  the services and costs for which payment was requested or made under  these regulations. These records shall be retained by the State or  alternate participant   for the periods of time specified for retention of records in the  Federal Procurement Regulations (41 CFR parts 1-20).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Audit basis. Auditing will be based on cost principles and  written guidelines in effect at the time services were provided and  costs were incurred. The State VR agency or alternate participant will  be informed and given a full explanation of any questioned items. It  will be given a reasonable time to explain questioned items. Any  explanation furnished by the State VR agency or alternate participant  will be given full consideration before a final determination is made on  questioned items in the audit report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeal of audit determinations. The appropriate SSA Regional  Commissioner will notify the State VR agency or alternate participant in  writing of his or her final determination on the audit report. If the  State VR agency (see Sec. 404.2118(b) for alternate participants)  disagrees with that determination, it may request reconsideration in  writing within 60 days after receiving the Regional Commissioner's  notice of the determination. The Commissioner will make a determination  and notify the State VR agency of that decision in writing, usually, no  later than 45 days from the date of appeal. The decision by the  Commissioner will be final and conclusive unless the State VR agency  appeals that decision in writing in accordance with 45 CFR part 16 to  the Department of Health and Human Services' Departmental Appeals Board  within 30 days after receiving it.
