After a claim becomes delinquent, the Administrator shall suspend or deny inspection and related services to any interested party who has failed to make timely payment of the fees and charges assessed, as well as any claims which have been rendered, and shall take such action as may be necessary to collect any amounts due. A deposit in advance sufficient to cover the fees and expenses for any subsequent service may be required of any person failing to pay his claim after issuance of such notice of delinquency.
