Notify the applicant in writing if additional time is required for the appellate review. The notification must include the reasons for the delay and state when the individual may expect an answer to the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Denial of appeals by failure to act. A requester may consider his or her appeal formally denied if the appeal authority fails:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To act on the appeal within 30 days;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To provide the requester with a notice of extension within 30 days; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To act within the time limits established in the Component's notice of extension (see paragraph (d)(5) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Denying access to OPM records held by the DoD Components.
