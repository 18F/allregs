                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appraisal. Upon receiving a notice of intent indicating an intent to extend the low income affordability restrictions under Sec. 248.153 or transfer the project under Sec. 248.157, the Commissioner shall provide for determination of the preservation values of the project pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice. Within 30 days after the filing of a notice of intent to extend the income restrictions or to transfer the project, the Commissioner shall provide the owner with written notice of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The need for, and the rules and guidelines governing, an appraisal of the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The filing deadline for submission of the appraisal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The need for an appraiser retained by the Commissioner to inspect the project and the project's financial records; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any delegation to an appropriate State agency, if any, by the Commissioner of responsibilities regarding the performance of an appraisal pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appraisers. The Commissioner and the owner shall each select and compensate an appraiser who shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Neither be an employee of the Federal Government nor an employee

or officer of any entity that is affiliated with the owner or the mortgagee of record;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be certified by the appropriate State agency under the standards established by the Federal Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 1451-1459); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Have six years of experience in the appraisal profession and at least three years experience in the practice of appraising multifamily residential properties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is not the subject of a charge issued following a reasonable cause determination under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Guidelines. The Commissioner shall provide to the owner and the appraiser retained by the Commissioner guidelines for conducting the appraisal. The guidelines established by the Commissioner shall be consistent with customary appraisal standards. The guidelines shall assume repayment of the existing federally-assisted mortgage(s), termination of the existing Federal low income affordability restrictions, simultaneous termination of any Federal rental assistance, and costs of compliance with any State or local laws of general applicability. The guidelines may permit reliance upon assessments of rehabilitation needs and other conversion costs determined by an appropriate State agency, as determined by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Operating expenses. For the purpose of determining preservation values, the guidelines shall instruct the appraiser to use the greater of actual project operating expenses at the time of the appraisal, based on the average of the actual project operating expenses during the preceding three years, or projected operating expenses after conversion, as determined by the Commissioner. However, if the current year operating expenses are higher than those of the preceding three years and the Commissioner has made a determination that these costs are unlikely to decrease in the future, the appraiser shall use current year operating expenses rather than operating expenses for the preceding three years for purposes of comparison with projected operating expenses after conversion. Likewise, if the current year operating expenses are lower than those of the preceding years and the Commissioner has made a determination that these costs are unlikely to increase in the future, the appraiser shall use current year operating expenses rather than operating expenses for the preceding three years for purposes of comparison with projected expenses after conversion. Where the highest and best use of a project is not as rental housing, the appraiser shall use projected operating expenses assuming conversion of the project to its highest and best use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Preservation values. The preservation values will be determined on the basis of the appraisals conducted by the owner's and the Commissioner's independent appraisers. Each appraiser will determine both the extension preservation value and the transfer preservation value, regardless of the owner's intentions as indicated in the notice of intent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Highest and best use as residential property. In determining the extension preservation value of the project, the appraiser shall assume conversion of the project to market-rate rental housing. The appraiser shall, in accordance with the guidelines established by the Commissioner, determine the amount of rehabilitation expenditures, if any, that would be necessary to bring the project up to quality standards required to attract and sustain a market-rate tenancy upon conversion and assess other costs that the owner could reasonably be expected to incur if the owner converted the property to market-rate multifamily rental housing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Highest and best use. In determining the transfer preservation value for the project, the appraiser shall assume conversion of the project to highest and best use for the property, and shall, in accordance with the guidelines established by the Commissioner, determine the amount of any rehabilitation expenditures, including demolition, that would be necessary to convert the project to such use and assess other costs that the owner could reasonably be expected to incur if the owner converted the property to its highest and best use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Submission of appraisal. Within four months after the filing of the notice of intent:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner shall submit to the HUD Field Office in whose jurisdiction the project is located, the appraisal made by the owner's selected appraiser; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commissioner's selected appraiser shall conduct and submit an appraisal to the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Joint determination of preservation values. No later than one month after the owner and the Commissioner exchange appraisals, the owner and the Commissioner shall, on the basis of the appraisals delivered to them, agree on the preservation values of the project. If no agreement as to preservation values can be reached, the owner and the Commissioner shall jointly select a third appraiser meeting the qualifications set forth in paragraph (c) of this section by the end of six months from the date that the notice of intent was filed. The cost of this third appraisal shall be borne equally by both parties. The third appraiser must comply with the guidelines set forth in paragraph (d) of this section and must conduct the appraisal and submit an appraisal within two months after accepting the assignment. The determination by the third appraiser of the project's preservation values shall be binding on both the owner and the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Timeliness of appraisals. The Commissioner may approve a plan of action to receive incentives under Sec. Sec. 248.153, 248.157 or 248.161 only based upon an appraisal conducted in accordance with this section that is not more than 30 months old, unless the failure of the Commissioner to approve the plan of action within the 30-month period was due to circumstances beyond the control of the owner.
