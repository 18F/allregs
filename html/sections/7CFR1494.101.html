                            <p class="depth0">This subpart contains the regulations governing the operation of the  Export Enhancement Program (EEP) of the Commodity Credit Corporation  (CCC). CCC will, from time to time, announce, through public press  release, initiatives to facilitate the export of U.S. agricultural  commodities to targeted markets. The public press release, which will  contain the name of a person for interested parties to contact, will be  followed by the issuance of an Invitation for Offers (Invitation).  Invitations will be issued pursuant to this subpart by the General Sales  Manager (GSM) and will specify the eligible country(ies) (the targeted  market), the unit of measure, the eligible commodity, the maximum  quantity of the eligible commodity eligible for a CCC bonus, the quality  specifications of the eligible commodity (including possible  restrictions on type, kind, grade and/or class or other quality  specifications), the eligible buyer(s), the method and rate for  determining liquidated damages and performance security requirements,  and any other terms and conditions peculiar to that Invitation.  Invitations may be one of the following two types: Those inviting  exporters which have a sales contract with an eligible buyer to submit a  competitive offer for a CCC Bonus; and those inviting exporters which  have a sales contract with an eligible buyer to apply for an Announced  CCC Bonus. After an interested person has qualified to submit an offer  for an eligible commodity, the eligible exporter may submit an offer to  CCC in response to an Invitation. Such offer must contain the  information required by this subpart and any additional information  required by   the applicable Invitation. The exporter's offer will include either the  Announced CCC Bonus, if applicable, or an amount in dollars and cents  for a bonus deemed necessary by the exporter to make a commercial sale  of the eligible commodity for export to the eligible country competitive  with export sales of the commodity by other exporting countries to  buyers in the eligible country. If the exporter has furnished the  required performance security and the offer is acceptable to CCC, then  CCC will notify the exporter that its offer has been accepted. CCC and  the exporter will enter into an Agreement in which CCC will agree to pay  the bonus to the exporter in return for the exporter's submission of  proof that the eligible commodity has been exported from the United  States and entered into the eligible country, in accordance with the  terms and conditions of the Agreement.</p>
