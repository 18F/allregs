                            <p class="depth0">Individuals do not always know what Act(s) to cite when requesting information. Nonetheless, it is DON policy to ensure that they receive the maximum access to information they are requesting. Accordingly, processing guidance is as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cite/imply PA. (1) Individuals who cite to the PA and/or seek access to records about themselves that are contained in a PA system of records that is retrieved by their name and personal identifier, will have their request processed under the provisions of the PA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Individuals who cite to the PA and/or seek access to records about themselves that are contained in a PA system of records that is retrieved by their name and personal identifier, will have their request processed under the provisions of the PA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If there is no ``Exemption Claimed for this System,'' then the record will be released to the requester unless: it contains classified information ((k)(1)

applies); was compiled in anticipation of litigation ((d)(5) applies); or contains information about another person. Although there is no ``privacy'' exemption under the PA, delete any information about other persons and explain in the response letter that ``information not about you'' was deleted from the response. There is no PA exemption to claim and no appeal rights to be given.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cite/imply FOIA. (1) Individuals who cite/imply FOIA when seeking access to records about themselves will have their request processed under PA, if the records they seek are contained in a PA system of records that is retrieved by their name and personal identifier. However, if the system of records notice contains an exemption rule, the release of information will be adjudicated using both PA and FOIA, ensuring that the individual receives the maximum amount of information allowable under the Acts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Individuals who cite/imply FOIA when seeking access to records about themselves will have their request processed under PA, if the records they seek are contained in a PA system of records that is retrieved by their name and personal identifier. However, if the system of records notice contains an exemption rule, the release of information will be adjudicated using both PA and FOIA, ensuring that the individual receives the maximum amount of information allowable under the Acts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Individuals who cite/imply FOIA and seek access to records about themselves that are not contained in a PA system of records that is retrieved by their name and personal identifier will have their request processed under FOIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Individuals who cite to the FOIA, but do not seek access to records about themselves, will have their request processed under FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cite to PA and FOIA. Individuals who cite to both PA and FOIA and seek access to records contained in a PA system of record retrieved by their name and personal identifier, will have their request as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the system of records does not cite to an exemption rule, does not contain classified information, or was not compiled in anticipation of litigation, the entire file is considered releasable under the PA. However, if the file contains information about another person, that information shall be withheld and the requester apprised that information about another individual has been deleted, since the information is not about them. Since no PA exemption exists for protecting privacy, no exemption rule can be cited and appeal rights do not have to be given.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the system of records does cite to a PA exemption rule, claim the exemption and process the request under the provisions of the FOIA, ensuring the requester receives the maximum release of information allowed under the Acts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Processing time limits. DON activities shall normally acknowledge receipt of PA requests within 10 working days and respond within 30 working days.</p>
