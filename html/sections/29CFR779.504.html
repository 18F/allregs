                            <p class="depth0">Section 12(c) was amended in 1961 to prohibit the employment of  oppressive child labor in any enterprise engaged in commerce or in the  production of goods for commerce. Thus, employers in every enterprise  which is covered under the Act must comply with section 12(c) of the  child labor provisions of the Act. As stated in Sec. 779.503,  compliance with this provision is necessary even though the employers in  a particular establishment or establishments of a covered enterprise are  exempt from the requirement of compensating employees in accordance with  sections 6 and 7 of the Act.    Sec. 779.505  ``Oppressive child labor'' defined.</p><p class="depth0">Section 3(1) of the Act defines oppressive child labor as follows:</p><p class="depth0">``Oppressive child labor'' means a condition of employment under  which (1) any employee under the age of 16 years is employed by an  employer (other than a parent or a person standing in place of a parent  employing his own child or a child in his custody under the age of 16  years in an occupation other than manufacturing or mining or an  occupation found by the Secretary of Labor to be particularly hazardous  for the employment of children between the ages of 16 and 18 years or  detrimental to their health or well-being) in any occupation, or (2) any  employee between the ages of 16 and 18 years is employed by an employer  in any occupation which the Secretary of Labor shall find and by order  declare to be particularly hazardous for the employment of children  between such ages or detrimental to their health or well-being; but  oppressive child labor shall not be deemed to exist by virtue of the  employment in any occupation of any person with respect to whom the  employer shall have on file an unexpired certificate issued and held  pursuant to regulations of the Secretary of Labor certifying that such  person is above the oppressive child labor age. The Secretary of Labor  shall provide by regulation or by order that the employment of employees  between the ages of 14 and 16 years in occupations other than  manufacturing and mining shall not be deemed to constitute oppressive  child labor if and to the extent that the Secretary of Labor determines  that such employment is confined to periods which will not interfere  with their schooling and to conditions which will not interfere with  their health and well-being.</p>
