                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Maintenance of effort. No assistance provided under this part (or any State or local government funds used to supplement this assistance) may be used to replace State or local funds previously used, or designated for use, to assist homeless persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Faith-based activities. (1) Equal treatment of program participants and program beneficiaries. (i) Program participants. Organizations that are religious or faith-based are eligible, on the same

basis as any other organization, to participate in the Continuum of Care program. Neither the Federal Government nor a State or local government receiving funds under the Continuum of Care program shall discriminate against an organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or affiliation. Recipients and subrecipients of program funds shall not, in providing program assistance, discriminate against a program participant or prospective program participant on the basis of religion or religious belief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Equal treatment of program participants and program beneficiaries. (i) Program participants. Organizations that are religious or faith-based are eligible, on the same

basis as any other organization, to participate in the Continuum of Care program. Neither the Federal Government nor a State or local government receiving funds under the Continuum of Care program shall discriminate against an organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or affiliation. Recipients and subrecipients of program funds shall not, in providing program assistance, discriminate against a program participant or prospective program participant on the basis of religion or religious belief.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Program participants. Organizations that are religious or faith-based are eligible, on the same

basis as any other organization, to participate in the Continuum of Care program. Neither the Federal Government nor a State or local government receiving funds under the Continuum of Care program shall discriminate against an organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or affiliation. Recipients and subrecipients of program funds shall not, in providing program assistance, discriminate against a program participant or prospective program participant on the basis of religion or religious belief.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Beneficiaries. In providing services supported in whole or in part with federal financial assistance, and in their outreach activities related to such services, program participants shall not discriminate against current or prospective program beneficiaries on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Separation of explicitly religious activities. Recipients and subrecipients of Continuum of Care funds that engage in explicitly religious activities, including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, must perform such activities and offer such services outside of programs that are supported with federal financial assistance separately, in time or location, from the programs or services funded under this part, and participation in any such explicitly religious activities must be voluntary for the program beneficiaries of the HUD-funded programs or services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Religious identity. A faith-based organization that is a recipient or subrecipient of Continuum of Care program funds is eligible to use such funds as provided under the regulations of this part without impairing its independence, autonomy, expression of religious beliefs, or religious character. Such organization will retain its independence from federal, State, and local government, and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that it does not use direct program funds to support or engage in any explicitly religious activities, including activities that involve overt religious content, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, or any manner prohibited by law. Among other things, faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to provide program-funded services, without removing or altering religious art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a Continuum of Care program-funded religious organization retains its authority over its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its organization's mission statements and other governing documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Alternative provider. If a program participant or prospective program participant of the Continuum of Care program supported by HUD objects to the religious character of an organization that provides services under the program, that organization shall, within a reasonably prompt time after the objection, undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the program participant to an alternative provider to which the prospective program participant has no objection. Except for services provided by telephone, the Internet, or similar means, the referral must be to an alternate provider in reasonable geographic proximity to the organization making the referral. In making the referral, the organization shall comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations. Recipients and subrecipients shall document any objections from program participants and prospective program participants and any efforts to refer such participants to alternative providers in accordance with the requirements of Sec.  578.103(a)(13). Recipients shall ensure that all subrecipient agreements make organizations receiving program funds aware of these requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Structures. Program funds may not be used for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of structures to the extent that those structures are used for explicitly religious activities. Program funds may be used for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of structures only to the extent

that those structures are used for conducting eligible activities under this part. When a structure is used for both eligible and explicitly religious activities, program funds may not exceed the cost of those portions of the acquisition, new construction, or rehabilitation that are attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the cost accounting requirements applicable to the Continuum of Care program. Sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that a Continuum of Care program-funded religious congregation uses as its principal place of worship, however, are ineligible for Continuum of Care program-funded improvements. Disposition of real property after the term of the grant, or any change in the use of the property during the term of the grant, is subject to governmentwide regulations governing real property disposition (see 24 CFR parts 84 and 85).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Supplemental funds. If a State or local government voluntarily contributes its own funds to supplement federally funded activities, the State or local government has the option to segregate the federal funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are commingled, this section applies to all of the commingled funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Restriction on combining funds. In a single structure or housing unit, the following types of assistance may not be combined:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Leasing and acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tenant-based rental assistance and acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Short- or medium-term rental assistance and acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rental assistance and leasing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Rental assistance and operating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Program fees. Recipients and subrecipients may not charge program participants program fees.</p>
