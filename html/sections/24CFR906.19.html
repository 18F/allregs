                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. In the case of a purchase of units for resale to low-income families by a PRE, the PHA must have an approved homeownership program that describes the use of a PRE to sell the units to low-income families within 5 years from the date of the PRE's acquisition of the units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> PRE requirements. The PHA must demonstrate in its homeownership program that the PRE has the necessary legal capacity and administrative capability to carry out its responsibilities under the program. The PHA's homeownership program also must contain a written agreement (not required to be submitted as part of the homeownership plan) that specifies the respective rights and obligations of the PHA and the PRE, and which includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assurances that the PRE will comply with all provisions of the HUD-approved homeownership program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assurances that the PRE will be subject to a title restriction providing that the property must be resold or otherwise transferred only by conveyance of individual dwellings to eligible families, in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership program, or by reconveyance to the PHA, and that the property will not be encumbered by the PRE without the written consent of the PHA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Protection against fraud or misuse of funds or other property on the part of the PRE, its employees, and agents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Assurances that the resale proceeds will be used only for the purposes specified by the HUD-approved homeownership program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Limitation of the PRE's administrative and overhead costs, and of any compensation or profit that may be realized by the PRE, to amounts that are reasonable in relation to its responsibilities and risks;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Accountability to the PHA and residents for the recordkeeping, reporting, and audit requirements of Sec. 906.33;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Assurances that the PRE will administer its responsibilities under the plan on a nondiscriminatory basis, in accordance with the Fair Housing Act, its implementing regulations, and other applicable civil rights statutes and authorities, including the authorities cited in Sec. 5.105(a) of this title; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Adequate legal remedies for the PHA and residents, in the event of the PRE's failure to perform in accordance with the agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sale to low-income families. The requirement for a PRE to sell units

under a homeownership program only to low-income families must be recorded as a deed restriction at the time of purchase by the PRE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Resale within five years. A PRE must agree that, with respect to any units it acquires under a homeownership program under this part, it will transfer ownership to the PHA if the PRE fails to resell the unit to a low-income family within 5 years of the PRE's acquisition of the unit.</p>
