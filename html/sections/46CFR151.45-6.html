If specific filling densities are designated in Subpart 151.50 of this part, they shall take precedence over that noted above.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Refrigerated and semirefrigerated tanks shall be filled so that there is an outage of at least 2 percent of the volume of the tank at the temperature corresponding to the vapor pressure of the cargo at the safety relief valve setting. A reduction in the required outage may be permitted by the Commandant when warranted by special design considerations. Normally, then, the maximum volume to which a tank may be loaded is:
VL = 0.98drV / dL
where:
VL = Maximum volume to which tank may be loaded.V = Volume of tank.dr = Density of cargo at the temperature required for a cargo</p><p class="depth2">vapor pressure equal to the relief valve setting.dL = Density of cargo at the loading temperature and pressure.</p>
