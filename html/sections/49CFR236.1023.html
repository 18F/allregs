The PTCPVL shall be made available to FRA upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> The railroad shall specify within its PTCSP all contractual arrangements with hardware and software suppliers or vendors for immediate notification between the parties of any and all safety-critical software failures, upgrades, patches, or revisions, as well as any hardware repairs, replacements, or modifications for their PTC system, subsystems, or components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The railroad shall specify within its PTCSP all contractual arrangements with hardware and software suppliers or vendors for immediate notification between the parties of any and all safety-critical software failures, upgrades, patches, or revisions, as well as any hardware repairs, replacements, or modifications for their PTC system, subsystems, or components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A vendor or supplier, on receipt of a report of any safety-critical failure to their product, shall promptly notify all other railroads that are using that product, whether or not the other railroads have experienced the reported failure of that safety-critical system, subsystem, or component.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The notification from a supplier to any railroad shall include explanation from the supplier of the reasons for such notification, the circumstances associated with the failure, and any recommended mitigation actions to be taken pending determination of the root cause and final corrective actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The railroad shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specify the railroad's process and procedures in its PTCSP for action upon their receipt of notification of safety-critical failure, as well as receipt of a safety-critical upgrade, patch, revision, repair, replacement, or modification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify configuration/revision control measures in its PTCSP that are designed to ensure the safety-functional requirements and the safety-critical hazard mitigation processes are not compromised as a result of any change and that such a change can be audited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The railroad shall provide to the applicable vendor or supplier the railroad's procedures for action upon notification of a safety-critical failure, upgrade, patch, or revision for the PTC system, subsystem, component, product, or process, and actions to be taken until the faulty system, subsystem, or component has been adjusted, repaired or replaced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> After the product is placed in service, the railroad shall maintain a database of all safety-relevant hazards as set forth in the PTCSP and those that had not previously been identified in the PTCSP. If the frequency of the safety-relevant hazard exceeds the thresholds set forth in the PTCSP, or has not been previously identified in the appropriate risk analysis, the railroad shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notify the applicable vendor or supplier and FRA of the failure, malfunction, or defective condition that decreased or eliminated the safety functionality;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Keep the applicable vendor or supplier and FRA apprised on a continual basis of the status of any and all subsequent failures; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Take prompt counter measures to reduce or eliminate the frequency of the safety-relevant hazards below the threshold identified in the PTCSP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each notification to FRA required by this section shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be made within 15 days after the vendor, supplier, or railroad discovers the failure, malfunction, or defective condition.
