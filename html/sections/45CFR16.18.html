If the Board decides that  mediation would be useful to resolve a dispute, the Board, in  consultation with the parties, may suggest use of mediation techniques  and will provide or assist in selecting a mediator. The mediator may  take any steps agreed upon by the parties to resolve the dispute or  clarify issues. The results of mediation are not binding on the parties  unless the parties so agree in writing. The Board will internally  insulate the mediator from any Board or staff members assigned to handle  the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In other cases. In any other grants dispute, the Board may,  within the limitations of its resources, offer persons trained in  mediation skills to aid in resolving the dispute. Mediation services  will only be offered at the request, or with the concurrence, of a  responsible federal program official in the program under which the  dispute arises. The Board will insulate the mediator if any appeal  subsequently arises from the dispute.</p>
