When  such an agreement is developed, and the territory covered by the  agreement extends outside the territorial limits of the originating  association or bank, the written consent of all affected banks or  associations is required. Reasonable compensation may be paid for  services rendered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Production credit associations and agricultural credit  associations may enter into agreements with private dealers or  cooperatives permitting them to take applications for loans from the  association to purchase farm   or aquatic equipment, supplies, and machinery. Such agreements shall  normally be limited to persons or businesses selling to farmers,  ranchers, or producers or harvesters of aquatic products and shall  contain credit limits consistent with sound credit standards. When the  sales territory of a dealer or cooperative extends outside the territory  of the originating association or the Farm Credit district, written  consent of each bank and association affected shall be obtained before  making such loans. Reasonable compensation may be paid or charged to a  dealer or cooperative for services rendered in connection with such  programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Farm Credit System institutions that are direct lenders may  enter into memoranda of understanding among themselves or with other  lenders for the simultaneous processing and closing of loans to a mutual  borrower. The basic policies and principles of each System lender shall  apply.  [47 FR 12146, Mar. 22, 1982.
