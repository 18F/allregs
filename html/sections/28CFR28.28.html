Violations of section 3600A may also be  subject to criminal sanctions as prescribed in subsection (f) of that  section. Section   3600A(f) makes it a felony offense, punishable by up to five years of  imprisonment, for anyone to knowingly and intentionally destroy, alter,  or tamper with biological evidence that is required to be preserved  under section 3600A with the intent to prevent that evidence from being  subjected to DNA testing or prevent the production or use of that  evidence in an official proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No effect on validity of convictions. Section 3600A's  requirements are enforceable through the disciplinary sanctions and  criminal sanctions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.  A failure to preserve biological evidence as required by section 3600A  does not provide a basis for relief in any postconviction proceeding.</p>
