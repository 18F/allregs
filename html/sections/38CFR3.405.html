                            <p class="depth0">Public Laws 106-377 and 108-183, which provide disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation at full-dollar rates to certain Filipino veterans and their survivors, are considered liberalizing laws. As such, the provisions of 38 CFR 3.114(a) apply when determining the effective date of an award. If the requirements of Sec.  3.114(a) are not satisfied, then the effective date of an award of benefits at the full-dollar rate under Sec.  3.42 will be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial entitlement to full-dollar rate. The latest of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Date entitlement arose;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Date on which the veteran or survivor first met the residency and citizenship or permanent resident alien status requirements in Sec.  3.42, if VA receives evidence of this within one year of that date; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effective date of service connection, provided VA receives evidence that the veteran or survivor meets the residency and citizenship or permanent resident alien status requirements in Sec.  3.42 within one year of the date of notification of the decision establishing service connection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Resumption of full-dollar rate. (1) Date the veteran or survivor returned to the United States after an absence of more than 60 consecutive days; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Date the veteran or survivor returned to the United States after an absence of more than 60 consecutive days; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> First day of the calendar year following the year in which the veteran or survivor was absent from the United States for a total of 183 days or more, or the first day after that date that the veteran or survivor returns to the United States.
