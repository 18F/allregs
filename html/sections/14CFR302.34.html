                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time for filing. Within ten (10) days after service of any  tentative decision of the DOT decisionmaker, any party to a proceeding  may file exceptions to such decision with the DOT decisionmaker.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form and contents of exceptions. Each exception shall be  separately numbered and shall be stated as a separate point, and  appellants shall not restate the same point in several exceptions. Each  exception shall state, sufficiently identify, and be limited to, an  ultimate conclusion in the decision to which exception is taken (such  as, selection of one carrier rather than another to serve any point or  points; points included in or excluded from a new route; imposition or  failure to impose a given restriction; determination of a rate at a  given amount rather than another). No specific exception shall be taken  with respect to underlying findings or statements, but exceptions to an  ultimate conclusion shall be deemed to include exceptions to all  underlying findings and statements pertaining thereto; Provided,  however, That exceptions shall specify any matters of law, fact, or  policy that were not argued before the administrative law judge but will  be set forth for the first time on brief to the DOT decisionmaker.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of failure to file timely and adequate exceptions. No  objection may be made on brief or at a later time to an ultimate  conclusion that is not expressly made the subject of an exception in  compliance with the provisions of this section; Provided, however, That  any party may file a brief in support of the decision and in opposition  to the exceptions filed by any other party.</p>
