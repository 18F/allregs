An employee or applicant who wishes to file a class complaint must seek counseling and be counseled in accordance with Sec. 268.104.

If a complainant moves for class certification after completing the counseling process contained in Sec. 268.104, no additional counseling is required. The administrative judge shall deny class certification when the complainant has unduly delayed in moving for certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing and presentation of a class complaint.

subclass be treated as a class, and the provisions of this section then shall be construed and applied accordingly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The administrative judge shall transmit his or her decision to accept or dismiss a complaint to the Board and the agent. The Board shall take final action by issuing a final order within 40 days of receipt of the hearing record and administrative judge's decision.

If a party fails without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to a request made or approved by the administrative judge for documents, records, comparative data, statistics or affidavits, and the information is solely in the control of one party, such failure may, in appropriate circumstances, cause the administrative judge:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To draw an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To consider the matters to which the requested information pertains to be established in favor of the opposing party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To exclude other evidence offered by the party failing to produce the requested information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> To recommend that a decision be entered in favor of the opposing party; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> To take such other actions as the administrative judge deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During the period for development of evidence, the administrative judge may, in his or her discretion, direct that an investigation of facts relevant to the class complaint or any portion be conducted by an agency certified by the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Both parties shall furnish to the administrative judge copies of all materials that they wish to be examined

It shall state that within 30 days of the date of the notice of resolution, any member of the class may petition the administrative judge to vacate the resolution because it benefits only the class agent, or is otherwise not fair, adequate and reasonable to the class as a whole. The administrative judge shall review the notice of resolution and consider any petitions to vacate filed. If the administrative judge finds that the proposed resolution is not fair, adequate and reasonable to the class as a whole, the administrative judge shall issue a decision vacating the agreement and may replace the original class agent with a petitioner or some other class member who is eligible to be the class agent during further processing of the class complaint. The decision shall inform the former class agent or the petitioner of the right to appeal the decision to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and include EEOC Form 573, Notice of Appeal/Petition.

The Board shall transmit the final decision to the agent within five days of the expiration of the 60-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The final decision of the Board shall require any relief authorized by law and determined to be necessary or desirable to resolve the issue of discrimination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The final decision on a class complaint shall, subject to subpart E of this part, be binding on all members of the class and the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The final decision shall inform the agent of the right to appeal or to file a civil action in accordance with subpart E of this part and of the applicable time limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Notification of decision. The Board shall notify class members of the final decision and relief awarded, if any, through the same media employed to give notice of the existence of the class complaint. The notice, where appropriate, shall include information concerning the rights of class members to seek individual relief, and of the procedures to be followed. Notice shall be given by the Board within 10 days of the transmittal of its final decision to the agent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Relief for individual class members.

The Board shall also, within 60 days of the issuance of the final decision finding no class-wide discrimination, issue the acknowledgment of receipt of an individual complaint as required by Sec. 268.105(d) and process in accordance with the provisions of subpart B of this part, each individual complaint that was subsumed into the class complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When discrimination is found in the final decision and a class member believes that he or she is entitled to individual relief, the class member may file a written claim with the Board or the Board's EEO Programs Director within 30 days of receipt of notification by the Board of its final decision. Administrative judges shall retain jurisdiction over the complaint in order to resolve any disputed claims by class members. The claim must include a specific, detailed showing that the claimant is a class member who was affected by the discriminatory policy or practice, and that this discriminatory action took place within the period of time for which the Board found class-wide discrimination in its final decision. Where a finding of discrimination against a class has been made, there shall be a presumption of discrimination as to each member of the class. The Board must show by clear and convincing evidence that any class member is not entitled to relief. The administrative judge may hold a hearing or otherwise supplement the record on a claim filed by a class member. The Board or the Commission may find class-wide discrimination and order remedial action for any policy or practice in existence within 45 days of the agent's initial contact with the Counselor. Relief otherwise consistent with this Part may be ordered for the time the policy or practice was in effect. The Board shall issue a final decision on each such claim within 90 days of filing. Such decision must include a notice of the right to file an appeal or a civil action in accordance with subpart E of this part and the applicable time limits.</p>
