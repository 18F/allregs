                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standard measures. A standard measure is a measure that can be  calculated in full or in part from claims data from other sources and  the standardized extracts of Medicare Parts A and B claims, and Part D  prescription drug event data and meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meets one of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is endorsed by the entity with a contract under section 1890(a)  of the Social Security Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is time-limited endorsed by the entity with a contract under  section 1890(a) of the Social Security Act until such time as the full  endorsement status is determined.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is developed under section 931 of the Public Health Service  Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Can be calculated from standardized extracts of Medicare Parts  A or B claims or Part D prescription drug event data, was adopted  through notice-and-comment rulemaking, and is currently being used in  CMS programs that include quality measurement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Is endorsed by a CMS-approved consensus-based entity. CMS will  approve organizations as consensus-based entities based on review of  documentation of the consensus-based entity's measure approval process.  To receive approval as a consensus-based entity, an organization must  submit information to CMS documenting its processes for stakeholder  consultation and measures approval; an organization will only receive  approval as a consensus-based entity if all measure specifications are  publically available. An organization will retain CMS acceptance as a  consensus-based entity for 3 years after the approval date, at which  time CMS will review new documentation of the consensus-based entity's  measure approval process for a new 3-year approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is used in a manner that follows the measure specifications as  written (or as adopted through notice-and-comment rulemaking), including  all numerator and denominator inclusions and exclusions, measured time  periods, and specified data sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alternative measure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An alternative measure is a measure  that is not a standard measure, but that can be calculated in full, or  in part, from claims data from other sources and the standardized  extracts of Medicare Parts A and B claims, and Part D prescription drug  event data, and that meets one of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Rulemaking process: Has been found by the Secretary, through a  notice-and comment-rulemaking process, to be more valid, reliable,  responsive to consumer preferences, cost-effective, or relevant to  dimensions of quality and resource use not addressed by standard  measures, and is used by a qualified entity in a manner that follows the  measure specifications as adopted through notice-and-comment rulemaking,  including all numerator and denominator inclusions and exclusions,  measured time periods, and specified data sources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Stakeholder consultation approval process: Has been found by  the Secretary, using documentation submitted by a qualified entity that  outlines its consultation and agreement with stakeholders in its  community, to be more valid, responsive to consumer preferences, cost- effective, or relevant to dimensions of quality and resource use not  addressed by standard measures, and is used by a qualified entity in a  manner that follows the measure specifications as submitted, including  all numerator and denominator inclusions and exclusions, measured time  periods, and specified data sources. If a CMS decision on approval or  disapproval of alternative measures submitted using the stakeholder  consultation approval process is not forthcoming within 60 days of  submission of the measure by the qualified entity, the measure will be  deemed approved. However, CMS retains the right to disapprove a measure  if, even after 60 days, we find it to not be ``more valid,   reliable, responsive to consumer preferences, cost-effective, or  relevant to dimensions of quality and resource'' than a standard  measure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An alternative measure approved under the process at paragraph  (b)(1)(i) of this section may be used by any qualified entity. An  alternative measure approved under the process at paragraph (b)(1)(ii)  of this section may only be used by the qualified entity that submitted  the measure for consideration by the Secretary. A qualified entity may  use an alternative measure up until the point that an equivalent  standard measure for the particular clinical area or condition becomes  available at which point the qualified entity must switch to the  standard measure within 6 months or submit additional scientific  justification and receive approval, via either paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or  (b)(1)(ii) of this section, from the Secretary to continue using the  alternative measure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To submit an alternative measure for consideration under the  notice-and-comment-rulemaking process, for use in the calendar year  following the submission, an entity must submit the following  information by May 31st:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the alternative measure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name of the developer or owner of the alternative measure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Detailed specifications for the alternative measure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Evidence that use of the alternative measure would be more  valid, reliable, responsive to consumer preferences, cost-effective, or  relevant to dimensions of quality and resource use not addressed by  standard measures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To submit an alternative measure for consideration under the  documentation of stakeholder consultation approval process described in  paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, for use once the measure is  approved by the Secretary, an entity must submit the following  information to CMS:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the alternative measure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name of the developer or owner of the alternative measure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Detailed specifications for the alternative measure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A description of the process by which the qualified entity  notified stakeholders in the geographic region it serves of its intent  to seek approval of an alternative measure. Stakeholders must include a  valid cross representation of providers, suppliers, payers, employers,  and consumers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A list of stakeholders from whom feedback was solicited,  including the stakeholders' names and roles in the community.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A description of the discussion about the proposed alternative  measure, including a summary of all pertinent arguments supporting and  opposing the measure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Unless CMS has already approved the same measure for use by  another qualified entity, no new scientific evidence on the measure is  available, and the subsequent qualified entity wishes to rely upon the  scientific evidence submitted by the previously approved applicant, an  explanation backed by scientific evidence that demonstrates why the  measure is more valid, reliable, responsive to consumer preferences,  cost-effective, or relevant to dimensions of quality and resource use  not addressed by a standard measure.</p>
