                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within 30 days after a transaction is completed, the importer must send to the Administration a return declaration containing particulars of the transaction, including the date, quantity, chemical, container, name of transferees, and any other information as the Administration may specify. A single return declaration may include the particulars of both the importation and distribution. If the importer has not distributed all chemicals imported by the end of the initial 30-day period, the importer must file supplemental return declarations no later than 30 days from the date of any further distribution, until the distribution or other disposition of all chemicals imported under the import notification or any update are accounted for.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an importation for which a Form 486 has been filed fails to take place, the importer must file an amended Form 486 notifying the Administration that the importation did not occur.
