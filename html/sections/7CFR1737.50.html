RUS shall review the LD  to determine that the system design is acceptable to RUS, that the  design is technically correct, that the cost estimates are reasonable,  and that the design provides for area coverage service. RUS shall also  review the population and incorporation status of all communities served  or to be served by the borrower to determine if any nonrural areas are  served and if municipal franchises are required. Any RUS lending for  nonrural areas must be in accordance with 7 CFR part 1735. RUS shall  also check the ``List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement of  Nonprocurement Programs'', compiled, maintained and distributed by  General Services Administration, to determine whether the borrower is  debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded (see 2 CFR  180.430).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> RUS will notify the borrower if RUS recommends major changes in  subscriber projections, design, cost estimates, or other significant  matters. RUS will not continue loan processing until RUS and the  borrower agree on all major changes.  [54 FR 13356, Apr. 3, 1989; 54 FR 16194, Apr. 21, 1989.
