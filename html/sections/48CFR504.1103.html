                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements found in FAR 4.1103, prior to awarding a contractual instrument the contracting officer must--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Verify that the prospective contractor's legal business name, Doing-Business-As (DBA) name (if any), physical street address, and Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number or DUNS+4 number, as found in the CCR, match the information that will be included in the contract, order, or agreement resulting from the vendor's quote or proposal. Correct any mismatches by having the vendor amend the information in the CCR and/or the quote or proposal. The CCR information can be accessed through GSA's CCR repository (contact the GSA Systems Programming Branch for instructions, a user ID, and password).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Ensure that the contractor's address code exists in Pegasys and that it is CCR enabled with the contractor's DUNS or DUNS+4 number. This can be done by searching Pegasys records using the contractor's Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). If no code exists, request that a new address code be established by the Finance Center for CCR compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Ensure that the contractor's identifying information is correctly placed on the contractual instrument, using special care to ensure that the legal name and ``remit to'' name match exactly. (Note: Lockbox names or numbers should not be used to replace the contractor's name in the remittance block on the contractual instrument.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Unless one of the exceptions to registration in CCR applies (see FAR 4.1102(a)), the contracting officer must not award a contract to a prospective contractor who is not registered in CCR. If no exceptions are applicable, and the needs of the requiring activity

allows for a delay in award, see FAR 4.1103(b)(1).
