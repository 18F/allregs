unnecessary, or contrary to patients' best interests. Requests from applicants should be submitted to the director of the FDA division responsible for reviewing the marketing application for the drug product, or for a biological product, to the application division in the office with product responsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the licensed practitioner who prescribes a drug product subject to this part determines that it is not in a particular patient's best interest to receive a Medication Guide because of significant concerns about the effect of a Medication Guide, the licensed practitioner may direct that the Medication Guide not be provided to the particular patient. However, the authorized dispenser of a prescription drug product subject to this part shall provide a Medication Guide to any patient who requests information when the drug product is dispensed regardless of any such direction by the licensed practitioner.</p>
