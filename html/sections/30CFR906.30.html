The MLRD shall conduct inspections on Federal lands and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the Program.</p><p class="depth0">14. The MLRD shall, subsequent to conducting any inspection, and on a timely basis, file with the Director a copy of each inspection report. Such report shall adequately describe (1) the general conditions of the lands under the permit; (2) the manner in which the operations are being conducted; and (3) whether the operator is complying with applicable performance and reclamation requirements.</p><p class="depth0">15. The MLRD will be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except as described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Federal inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 743, as part 743 relates to obligations under laws other than the Act.</p><p class="depth0">16. OSM shall ordinarily give the MLRD reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide State inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection. When OSM is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public health and safety or significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1(ii)(C), it will contact MLRD no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection.

During any joint inspection by OSM and MLRD, MLRD shall have primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. The MLRD shall consult OSM prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit.</p><p class="depth0">19. During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection where the

MLRD and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement action shall be based on the performance standards included in the regulations of the approved Program, and shall be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.</p><p class="depth0">20. The MLRD and the Department shall promptly notify each other of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits subject to this Agreement and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.</p><p class="depth0">21. Personnel of the State and representatives of the Department shall be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.</p><p class="depth0">22. This Agreement does not limit the Department's authority to enforce violations of Federal law which establish standards and requirements which are authorized by laws other than the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Article IX: Bonds</p><p class="depth0">23. For all surface coal mining operations on Federal lands, the MLRD and the Secretary shall require each operator to submit a single performance bond payable to the State and to the United States, if required by Federal regulations, to cover the operator's responsibilities under the Act and the Program. Such performance bond shall be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the Act, the Program and any other requirements imposed by the Department under the MLA, as amended. If the Agreement is terminated, all bonds will revert to being payable only to the United States to the extent that Federal lands are involved. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 30 CFR subpart3473 or a lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in certain circumstances, by section 715 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">24. Prior to releasing the operator from an obligation under a performance bond required by the Program, the MLRD shall obtain the concurrence of OSM. the MLRD shall also advise OSM of annual adjustments to the performance bond, pursuant to the Program. Departmental concurrence shall include coordination with other Federal agencies having authority over the lands involved.</p><p class="depth0">25.

The Department or the State may from time to time promulgate new or revised performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement and administration procedures. Each party shall, if it determines it to be necessary to keep this Agreement in force, change or revise its regulations and request necessary legislative action. Such changes shall be made under the procedures of 30 CFR part 732 for changes to the State Program and under the procedures of section 501 of the Act for changes to the Federal lands program.</p><p class="depth0">31. The MLRD and the Department shall provide each other with copies of any changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations and standards pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Article XV: Changes in Personnel and Organization</p><p class="depth0">32. Each party to this Agreement shall notify the other, when necessary, of any changes in personnel, organization and funding or other changes that will affect the implementation of this Agreement to ensure coordination of responsibilities and facilitate cooperation.</p><p class="depth0">Article XVI: Reservation of Rights</p><p class="depth0">33. In accordance with 30 CFR 745.13, this Agreement shall not be construed as waiving or preventing the assertion of any rights that have not been expressly addressed in this Agreement that the State or the Secretary may have under other laws or regulations, including but not limited to those listed in appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">Dated: September 27, 1982.</p><p class="depth0">Richard D.
