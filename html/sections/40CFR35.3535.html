A State may use up to 2  percent of its allotment to provide technical assistance to small  systems. A State may use these funds for activities such as supporting a  State technical assistance team or contracting with outside  organizations or other parties to provide technical assistance to small  systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> State program management. A State may use up to 10 percent of  its allotment for State program management activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This set-aside may only be used for the following activities:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To administer the State PWSS program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To administer or provide technical assistance through source  water protection programs (including a Class V Underground Injection  Control Program), except for enforcement actions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To develop and implement a capacity development strategy; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> To develop and implement an operator certification program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Match requirement. A State must provide a dollar for dollar  match for expenditures made under this set-aside.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The match must be provided at the time of the capitalization  grant award or in the same year that funds for this set-aside are  expected to be expended in accordance with a workplan approved by EPA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A State is authorized to use the amount of State funds it  expended on its PWSS program in fiscal year 1993 (including PWSS match)  as a credit toward meeting its match requirement. The value of this  credit can be up to, but not greater than, 50 percent of the amount of  match that is required. After determining the value of the credit that  it is eligible to receive, a State must provide the additional funds  necessary to meet the remainder of the match requirement. The source of  these additional funds can be State funds (excluding PWSS match) or  documented in-kind services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Local assistance and other State programs.

A system must demonstrate how the purchase of land or easements will  protect the source water of the system from contamination and ensure  compliance with national primary drinking water regulations. A State  must develop a priority setting process for determining what parcels of  land or easements to purchase or use an established priority setting  process that meets the same goals. A State must seek public review and  comment on its priority setting process and must identify the systems  that received loans and include a description of the specific parcels of  land or easements purchased in the Biennial Report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A State may provide assistance only in the form of loans to  community water systems to assist in implementing voluntary, incentive- based source water protection measures in areas delineated under a  source water assessment program under section 1453 of the Act and for  source water petitions under section 1454 of the Act. A State must  develop a list of systems that may receive loans, giving priority to  activities that facilitate compliance with national primary drinking  water regulations applicable to the systems or otherwise significantly  further the health protection objectives of the Act. A State must seek  public review and comment on its priority setting process and its list  of systems that may receive loans.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A State may make expenditures to establish and implement  wellhead protection programs under section 1428 of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A State may provide assistance, including technical and  financial assistance, to public water systems as part of a capacity  development strategy under section 1420(c) of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A State may make expenditures from its fiscal year 1997  capitalization grant to delineate and assess source water protection  areas for public water systems under section 1453 of the Act.
