The reviewing authority may terminate coverage under this permit by rule, and thereby terminate that permittee's authorization to construct or modify, and that permitted source's authorization to operate under this permit by rule for cause as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. The reviewing authority may provide the permittee with notice of the intent to terminate, and delay the effective date of the termination to allow the permittee to obtain a source specific permit as required by the reviewing authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Permit becomes invalid. Authority to construct and operate under this permit by rule becomes invalid if the permittee does not commence construction within 18 months after the Notification of Coverage is received by the reviewing authority, if the permittee discontinues construction for a period of 18 months or more, or if the permittee does not complete construction within a reasonable time. The reviewing authority may extend the 18-month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified according to 40 CFR 49.156(e)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Vapor balance system design criteria, management practices, and performance testing.
