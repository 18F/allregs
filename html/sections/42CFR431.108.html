                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraph  (a)(2) of this section, this section applies to Medicaid provider  agreements with entities that, as a basis for participation in  Medicaid--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are subject to survey and certification by CMS or the State  survey agency; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Are deemed to meet Federal requirements on the basis of  accreditation by an accrediting organization whose program has CMS  approval at the time of accreditation survey and accreditation decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. A Medicaid provider agreement with a laboratory is  effective only while the laboratory has in effect a valid CLIA  certificate issued under part 493 of this chapter, and only for the  specialty and subspecialty tests it is authorized to perform.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All requirements are met on the date of survey. The agreement is  effective on the date the onsite survey (including the Life Safety Code  survey if applicable) is completed, if on that date the provider meets--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All applicable Federal requirements as set forth in this  chapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any other requirements imposed by the State for participation in  the Medicaid program. (If the provider has a time-limited agreement, the  new agreement is effective on the day following expiration of the  current agreement.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All requirements are not met on the date of survey. If on the  date the survey is completed the provider fails to meet any of the  requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the following  rules apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An NF provider agreement is effective on the date on which--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The NF is found to be in substantial compliance as defined in  Sec.  488.301 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> CMS or the State survey agency receives from the NF, if  applicable, an approvable waiver request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For an agreement with any other provider, the effective date is  the earlier of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date on which the provider meets all requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date on which a provider is found to meet all conditions of  participation but has lower level deficiencies, and CMS or the State  survey agency receives from the provider an acceptable plan of  correction for the lower level deficiencies, or an approvable waiver  request, or both. (The date of receipt is the effective date of the  agreement, regardless of when CMS approves the plan of correction or  waiver request, or both.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Accredited provider requests participation in the Medicaid  program--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. If a provider is currently accredited by a  national accrediting organization whose program had CMS approval at the  time of accreditation survey and accreditation decision, and on the  basis of accreditation, CMS has deemed the provider to meet Federal  requirements, the effective date depends on whether the provider is  subject to requirements in addition to those included in the accrediting  organization's approved program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provider subject to additional requirements. For a provider that  is subject to additional requirements, Federal or State, or both, the  effective date is the date on which the provider meets all requirements,  including the additional requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provider not subject to additional requirements. For a provider  that is not subject to additional requirements, the effective date is  the date of the provider's initial request for participation if on that  date the provider met all Federal requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rule: Retroactive effective date. If the provider meets  the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) of  this section, the effective   date may be retroactive for up to one year, to encompass dates on which  the provider furnished, to a Medicaid beneficiary, covered services for  which it has not been paid.
