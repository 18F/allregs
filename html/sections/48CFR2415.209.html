The Contracting Officer shall adapt paragraph (c) of the provision (i.e., include, delete, revise, or further supplement subparagraphs) to address the particular

requirements of the immediate solicitation. The provision may be used in simplified acquisitions when it is necessary to obtain technical and management information in making the award selection. When award selection will be made through the lowest-priced technically acceptable source selection process, the provision shall be used with its Alternate I. If the proposed contract requires work on, or access to, HUD systems or applications (see the clause at 2452.239-70), the provision shall be used with its Alternate II. When the contracting officer has determined that it is necessary to limit the size of the technical and management portion of offers submitted by offerors, the provision shall be used with its Alternate III. The contracting officer shall clearly identify in the provision any contents of the technical and management portion of offers that are excluded from the size limitation (e.g., proposed contractor staff resumes).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contracting Officer shall insert a provision substantially the same as the provision at 2452.215-70, Proposal Content, in all solicitations for negotiated procurements using the tradeoff selection process (see FAR 15.101-1) expected to exceed the simplified acquisition limit.
