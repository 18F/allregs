                                Sec. 11.38  Assessment Plan--preliminary estimate of damages.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement. When performing a type B assessment pursuant to the  requirements of subpart E of this part, the authorized official shall  develop a preliminary estimate of: the anticipated costs of restoration,  rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources  for the injured natural resources; and the compensable value, as defined  in Sec. 11.83(c) of this part, of the injured natural resources, if the  authorized official intends to include compensable value in the damage  claim. This preliminary estimate is referred to as the preliminary  estimate of damages. The authorized official shall use the guidance  provided in this section, to the extent possible, to develop the  preliminary estimate of damages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. The purpose of the preliminary estimate of damages is  for reference in the scoping of the Assessment Plan to ensure that the  choice of the scientific, cost estimating, and valuation methodologies  expected to be used in the damage assessment fulfills the requirements  of reasonable cost, as that term is used in this part. The authorized  official will also use the preliminary estimate of damages in the review  of the Assessment Plan, as required in Sec. 11.32(f) of this part, to  ensure the requirements of reasonable cost are still met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Steps. The preliminary estimate of damages should include  consideration of the ability of the resources to recover naturally and,  if relevant, the compensable value through the recovery period with and  without possible alternative actions. The authorized official shall  consider the following factors, to the extent possible, in making the  preliminary estimate of damages:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The preliminary estimate of costs of restoration,  rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources  should include consideration of a range of possible alternative actions  that would accomplish the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/ or acquisition of the equivalent of the injured natural resources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The preliminary estimate of costs should take into account the  effects, or anticipated effects, of any response actions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The preliminary estimate of costs should represent the expected  present value of anticipated costs, expressed in constant dollars, and  should include direct and indirect costs, and include the timing of  those costs. The provisions detailed in Sec. Sec. 11.80-11.84 of this  part are the basis for the development of the estimate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The discount rate to be used in developing the preliminary  estimate of costs shall be that determined in accordance with the  guidance in Sec. 11.84(e) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The preliminary estimate of compensable value should be  consistent with the range of possible alternatives for restoration,  rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources  being considered.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The preliminary estimate of compensable value should represent  the expected present value of the anticipated compensable value,  expressed in constant dollars, accrued through the period for the  restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of  equivalent resources to baseline conditions, i.e., between the  occurrence of the discharge or release and the completion of (A) the  restoration or rehabilitation of the injured natural resources to a  condition where they can provide the level of services available at  baseline, or (B) the replacement and/or acquisition of equivalent  natural resources capable of providing such services. The estimate  should use the same base year as the preliminary estimate of costs of  restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of  equivalent resources. The provisions detailed in Sec. Sec. 11.80-11.84  of this part are the basis for the development of this estimate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The preliminary estimate of compensable value should take into  account the effects, or anticipated effects, of any response actions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The discount rate to be used in developing the preliminary  estimate of compensable value shall be that determined in accordance  with the guidance in Sec. 11.84(e) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Content and timing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In making the preliminary estimate of  damages, the authorized official should rely upon   existing data and studies. The authorized official should not undertake  significant new data collection or perform significant modeling efforts  at this stage of the assessment planning phase.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where possible, the authorized official should make the  preliminary estimate of damages before the completion of the Assessment  Plan as provided for in Sec. 11.31 of this part. If there is not  sufficient existing data to make the preliminary estimate of damages at  the same time as the assessment planning phase, this analysis may be  completed later, at the end of the Injury Determination phase of the  assessment, at the time of the Assessment Plan review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The authorized official is not required to disclose the  preliminary estimate before the conclusion of the assessment. At the  conclusion of the assessment, the preliminary estimate of damages, along  with its assumptions and methodology, shall be included in the Report of  the Assessment as provided for in Sec. 11.91 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Review. The authorized official shall review, and revise as  appropriate, the preliminary estimate of damages at the end of the  Injury Determination and Quantification phases. If there is any  significant modification of the preliminary estimate of damages, the  authorized official shall document it in the Report of the Assessment.  [59 FR 14282, Mar. 25, 1994.
