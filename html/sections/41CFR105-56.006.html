                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The employee may request a pre-offset hearing by filing a  written petition with the appropriate program official indicated in the  pre-offset notice, within 15 days of receipt of the written notice. The  petition must state why the employee believes GSA's determination  concerning the existence and/or amount of the debt is in error, set  forth any objections to the involuntary repayment schedule, and, if the  employee is seeking an oral hearing, set forth reasons for an oral  hearing. The timely filing of a petition will suspend the commencement  of collection proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The employee's petition or statement must be signed and dated by  the employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Petitions for hearing made after the expiration of the 15-day  period may be accepted if the employee can show that the delay was  because of circumstances beyond his or her control or because of failure  to receive notice of the time limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the employee timely requests a pre-offset hearing or the  timeliness is waived, the appropriate program official must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Promptly notify the CBCA and arrange for a hearing official (see  Sec. 105-56.003(m) of this subpart). The hearing official will notify  the employee whether he or she may have an oral or a ``paper hearing,''  i.e., a review on the written record (see 31 CFR 901.3(e)); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide the hearing official with a copy of all records on which  the determination of the debt and any involuntary repayment schedule are  based.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If an oral hearing is to be held, the hearing official will  notify the appropriate program official and the employee of the date,  time, and location of the hearing. The debtor may choose to have the  hearing conducted in the hearing official's office located at 1800 M  Street NW., 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20036, at another location  designated by the hearing official, or by telephone. The debtor and any  witnesses are responsible for any personal expenses incurred to arrive  at a hearing official's office or other designated location (see Sec.  105-56.007(c)). All telephonic charges incurred during a hearing will be  the responsibility of GSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the employee later elects to have the hearing based only on  the written submissions, notification must be given to the hearing  official and the appropriate program official at least 3 days before the  date of the oral hearing. The hearing official may waive the 3-day  requirement for good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If either party, without good cause as determined by the hearing  official, does not appear at a scheduled oral hearing, the hearing  official will make a determination on the claim which takes into account  that party's position as presented in writing only.  [68 FR 68752, Dec. 10, 2003, as amended at 78 FR 29247, May 20, 2013]</p>
