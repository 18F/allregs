In cases where a State agency can demonstrate that a local, dedicated, or single function (issuance or certification only) system will provide for more efficient and effective administration of the program, FNS may grant an exception to the State wide integrated requirement. These exceptions will be based on an assessment of the proposed system's ability to meet the State agency's need for automation. Systems funded as exceptions to this rule, however, should be capable to the extent necessary, of an automated data exchange with the State agency system used to administer TANF. In no circumstances will funding be available for systems which duplicate other State agency systems, whether presently operational or planned for future development.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Basis for continued Federal financial participation (FFP)--(1) FNS will continue FFP at the levels approved in the Planning APD and the Implementation APD provided that project development proceeds in accordance with the conditions and terms of the approved APD and that IS resources are used for the purposes authorized. FNS will use the APDU to monitor IS project development. The submission of the Update as prescribed in Sec. 277.18(d) for the duration of project development is a condition for continued FFP.

In addition, periodic onsite reviews of IS project development and State and local agency IS operations may be conducted by or for FNS to assure compliance with approved APDs, proper use of IS resources, and the adequacy of State or local agency IS operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pre-implementation. The State agency must demonstrate through thorough testing that the system meets all program functional and performance requirements. FNS may require a pre-implementation review of the system to validate system functionality prior to State agency testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Testing. The State agency must provide a complete test plan prior to the start of the testing phase. The State agency must provide documentation to FNS of the results of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) before the system is piloted in a production environment. FNS concurrence to advance from testing to pilot is a condition for continued FFP. All aspects of program eligibility must be tested to ensure that the system makes accurate eligibility determinations in accordance with federal statutes and regulations and approved State policies, and that system functionality meets the required functional specifications. The State agency shall describe how all system testing will be conducted and the resources to be utilized in order to verify the system complies with SNAP requirements, system design specifications, and performance standards including responsiveness, usability, capacity and security. Testing includes but is not limited to unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, end-to-end testing, UAT and regression testing. During UAT detailed scripts covering all areas of program functionality shall be used so that any errors identified can be replicated, corrected and re-tested. At a minimum, the Test Plan shall address:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The types of testing to be performed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The organization of the test team and associated responsibilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Test database generation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Test case development;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Test schedule;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Documentation of test results;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Acceptance testing, to include functional requirements testing, error condition handling and destructive

testing, security testing, recovery testing, controls testing, stress and throughput performance testing, and regression testing; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The decision criteria, including specific test results which must be met before the State may exit the testing phase, the roles or titles of the individuals responsible for verifying that these criteria have been met, and the sign-off process which will document that the criteria have been met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> FNS may require any or all of these tests to be repeated in instances where significant modifications are made to the system after these tests are initially completed or if problems that surfaced during initial testing warrant a retest. FNS reserves the right to participate and conduct independent testing, as necessary, during UAT and at appropriate times during system design, development, implementation and operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pilot. Prior to statewide rollout of the system there must be a test of the fully operational system in a live production environment. Pilots must operate until a state of routine operation is reached with the full caseload in the pilot area. The design of this pilot shall provide an opportunity to test all components of the system as well as the data conversion process and system performance. The duration of the pilot must be for a sufficient period of time to thoroughly evaluate the system (usually a minimum duration of three months). The State agency must provide documentation to FNS of the pilot evaluation. FNS approval to implement the system more broadly is a condition for continued FFP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Post-implementation Review. After the system is fully implemented, FNS may conduct a review to validate that program policy is correctly applied, whether project goals and objectives were met, that IS equipment and services are being properly used and accurate inventory records exist, and the actual costs of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Disallowance of Federal financial participation (FFP). If FNS finds that any acquisition approved under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section fails to comply with the criteria, requirements and other undertakings described in the approved or modified APD, payment of FFP may be suspended or may be disallowed in whole or in part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Emergency acquisition requirements. The State agency may request FFP for the costs of IS equipment and services acquired to meet emergency situations in which the State agency can demonstrate to FNS an immediate need to acquire IS equipment or services in order to continue operation of SNAP; and the State agency can clearly document that the need could not have been anticipated or planned for and precludes the State from following the prior approval requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. FNS may provide FFP in emergency situations if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State agency must submit a written request to FNS prior to the acquisition of any IS equipment or services. The written request shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A brief description of the IS equipment and/or services to be acquired and an estimate of their costs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A brief description of the circumstances which result in the State agency's need to proceed with the acquisition prior to fulfilling approval requirements at paragraph (c) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the adverse impact which would result if the State agency does not immediately acquire the IS equipment and/or services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upon receipt of a written request for emergency acquisition FNS shall provide a written response to the State agency within 14 days. The FNS response shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Inform the State agency that the request has been disapproved and the reason for disapproval; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FNS recognizes that an emergency situation exists and grants conditional approval pending receipt of the State agency's formal submission of the IAPD information specified at paragraph (d)(2) of this section within 90 days from the date of the State agency's initial written request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If FNS approves the request submitted under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, FFP will be available from the date the State agency acquires the IS equipment and services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the complete IAPD submission required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section is not received by FNS within 90 days from the date of the initial written request, costs may be subject to disallowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> General cost requirements--(1) Cost determination. Actual costs must be determined in compliance with OMB Circular A-87 (available on OMB's Web site at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_default/) and an FNS approved budget, and must be reconcilable with the approved FNS funding level. A State agency shall not claim reimbursement for costs charged to any other Federal program or uses of IS systems for purposes not connected with SNAP. The approved APD cost allocation plan includes the methods which will be used to identify and classify costs to be claimed. This methodology must be submitted to FNS as part of the request for FNS approval of funding as required in paragraph (d) of this section. Operational costs are to be allocated based on the statewide cost allocation plan rather than the APD cost plan. Approved cost allocation plans for ongoing operational costs shall not apply to IS system development costs under this section unless documentation required under paragraph (c) of this section is submitted to and approvals are obtained from FNS. Any APD-related costs approved by FNS shall be excluded in determining the State agency's administrative costs under any other section of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cost determination.

Any APD-related costs approved by FNS shall be excluded in determining the State agency's administrative costs under any other section of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cost identification for purposes of FFP claims. State agencies shall assign and claim the costs incurred under an approved APD in accordance with the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Development costs. Using its normal departmental accounting system, in accordance with the cost principles set forth in OMB Circular A-87 (available on OMB's Web site at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_default/), the State agency shall specifically identify what items of costs constitute development costs, assign these costs to specific project cost centers, and distribute these costs to funding sources based on the specific identification, assignment and distribution outlined in the approved APD. The methods for distributing costs set forth in the APD should provide for assigning identifiable costs, to the extent practicable, directly to program/functions. The State agency shall amend the cost allocation plan required by Sec. 277.9 (administrative cost principles) to include the approved APD methodology for the identification, assignment and distribution of the development costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Operational costs. Costs incurred for the operation of an IS shall be identified and assigned by the State agency to funding sources in accordance with the approved cost allocation plan required by Sec. 277.9 (administrative cost principles).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Service agreement costs. States that operate a central data processing facility shall use their approved central service cost allocation plan required by OMB Circular A-87 (available on OMB's Web site at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_default/) to identify and assign costs incurred under service agreements with the State agency. The State agency shall then distribute these costs to funding sources in accordance with paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Capital expenditures. The State agency shall charge the costs of IT equipment having unit acquisition costs or total aggregate costs, at the time of acquisition, of more than $25,000 by means of depreciation or use allowance, unless a waiver is specifically granted by FNS. If the equipment acquisition is part of an APD that is subject to the prior approval requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the State agency may submit the waiver request as part of the APD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Claiming costs. Prior to claiming funding under this section the State agency shall have complied with the requirements for obtaining approval and prior approval of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Budget authority. FNS approval of requests for funding shall provide notification to the State agency of the budget authority and dollar limitations under which such funding may be claimed. FNS shall provide this amount as a total authorization for

Sec. Appendix A to Part 277--Principles for Determining Costs Applicable</p><p class="depth0">to Administration of the Food Stamp Program by State Agencies</p><p class="depth0">This appendix sets forth the procedures implementing uniform requirements for the negotiations and approval of cost allocation plans with State agencies, in accordance with the provisions of Federal Management Circular (FMC) 74-4 and OASC-10, ``Cost Principles and Procedures for Establishing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Grants and Contracts with the Federal Government,'' U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. This material is adapted substantially from the circular; changes have been made only when necessary in order to conform with legislative constraints.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Purpose and scope.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Objectives. This appendix sets forth principles for determining the allowable costs of administering the Food Stamp Program by State agency under FNS-approved State Plans of Operation. The principles are for the purpose of cost determination and are not intended to identify the circumstances or dictate the extent of Federal and State or local participation in the financing of the Program. They are designed to provide that all federally assisted programs bear their fair share of costs recognized under these principles, except where restricted or prohibited by law. No provision for profit or other increment above cost is intended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Policy guides. The application of these principles is based on the fundamental premises that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> State agencies are responsible for the efficient and effective administration of the Food Stamp Program through the application of sound management practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The State agency assumes the responsibility for seeing that Food Stamp Program funds have been expended and accounted for consistent with underlying agreements and program objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Each State agency, in recognition of its own unique combination of staff facilities and experience, will have the primary responsibility for employing whatever form of organization and management techniques as may be necessary to assure proper and efficient administration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application. These principles will be applied by FNS in determining costs incurred by State agencies receiving FNS payments for administering the Food Stamp Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">Approval or authorization by FNS means documentation evidencing consent prior to incurring specific costs.</p><p class="depth0">Cognizant Federal Agency means the Federal agency recognized by OMB as having the predominate interest in terms of program dollars.</p><p class="depth0">Cost allocation plan means the documentation identifying, accumulating, and distributing allowable costs of program administration together with the allocation methods used.</p><p class="depth0">Cost, as used herein, means cost as determined on a cash, accrual, or other basis acceptable to FNS as a discharge of the State agency's accountability for FNS funds.</p><p class="depth0">Cost center means a pool, summary account, objective or area established for the accumulation of costs. Such areas include objective organizational units, functions, objects or items of expense, as well as ultimate cost objective(s) including specific costs, products, projects, contracts, programs and other operations.</p><p class="depth0">Federal agency means FNS and also any department, agency, commission, or instrumentality in the executive branch of the Federal Government which makes grants to or contracts with State or local governments.</p><p class="depth0">Payments for administrative costs means reimbursement or advances for costs to State agencies pursuant to any agreement whereby FNS provides funds to carry out programs, services, or activities in connection with administration of the Food Stamp Program. The principles and policies stated in this appendix as applicable to program payments in general also apply to any State agency obligations under a cost reimbursement type of agreement performed by a subagency, including contracts and subcontracts.</p><p class="depth0">Food Stamp Program administration means those activities and operations of the State agency which are necessary to carry out the purposes of the Food Stamp Act, including any portion of the Program financed by the State agency.</p><p class="depth0">Local unit means any political subdivision of government below the State level.</p><p class="depth0">Other agencies of the State means departments or agencies of the State or local unit which provide goods, facilities, and services to a State agency.</p><p class="depth0">Subagencies means the organization or person to which a State agency makes any payment for acquisition of goods, materials or services for use in administering the Food Stamp Program and which is accountable to the State agency for the use of the funds provided.</p><p class="depth0">Service, as used herein, means goods and facilities, as well as services.</p><p class="depth0">Supporting services means auxiliary functions necessary to sustain the direct effort of administering the Program. These services may be centralized in the State agency or in some other agency, and include procurement, payroll, personnel functions, maintenance and operation of space, data processing, accounting, budgeting, auditing, mail and messenger service, and the like.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Basic guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Factors affecting allowability of costs. To be allowable under the Program, costs must meet the following general criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient administration of the Program, be allocable thereto under these principles, and, except as specifically provided herein, not be a general expense required to carry out the overall responsibilities of State or local governments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Be authorized or not prohibited under State or local laws or regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these principles, Federal Laws, or other governing limitations as to types or amounts of cost items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Be consistent with policies, regulations, and procedures that apply uniformly to both federally assisted and other activities of the unit of government of which the State agency is a part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Be accorded consistent treatment through application of generally accepted accounting principles appropriate to the circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Not be allocable to or included as a cost to any other federally financed program in either the current or a prior period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Be the net of all applicable credits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocable costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A cost allocable to a particular cost objective to the extent of benefits received by such objective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any cost allocable to a particular program or cost objective under these principles may not be shifted to other Federal programs to overcome fund deficiencies, avoid restrictions imposed by law or grant agreement, or for other reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Where an allocation of joint cost will ultimately result in charges to the Program, an allocation plan will be required as prescribed in section I of these principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Applicable credits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicable credits refer to those receipts or reduction of expenditure-type transactions which offset or reduce expense items allocable to programs as direct or indirect costs. Examples of such transactions are: Purchase discounts; rebates or allowances; recoveries or indemnities on losses; sale of publications, equipment, and scrap; income from personal or incidental services; and adjustments of overpayments or erroneous charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicable credits may also arise when Federal funds are received or are available from sources other than FNS to finance operations or capital items donated or financed by the Federal Government to fulfill matching requirements under another program. These types of credits should likewise be used to reduce related expenditures in determining the rates or amounts applicable to a given program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Composition of cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Total cost. The total cost of a program is comprised of the allowable direct cost incident to its performance, plus its allocable portion of allowable indirect costs, less applicable credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Classification costs. There is no universal rule for classifying certain costs as either direct or indirect under every accounting system. A cost may be direct with respect to some specific service or function, but indirect with respect to a program or other ultimate cost objective. However, it is essential that each item of cost be treated consistently either as a direct or an indirect cost. Specific guides for determining direct and indirect costs allocable under the Program are provided in the section which follows.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Direct costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Direct costs are those that can be identified specifically with a particular cost objective. These costs may be charged directly to the Program, contracts, or to other programs against which costs are finally lodged. Direct costs may also be charged to cost objectives used for the accumulation of costs pending distribution in the course to programs and other ultimate costs objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application. Typical direct costs chargeable to the Program are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Compensation of employees for the time and effort devoted specifically to the administration of the Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Cost of materials acquired, consumed, or expended specifically for the purpose of the Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Equipment and other approved capital expenditures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Other items of expense incurred specifically for efficiently and effectively administering the Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Service furnished specifically for the Program by other agencies, provided such charges are consistent with criteria outlined in section G of these principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Indirect costs are those (a) incurred for a common or joint purpose benefiting more than one cost objective, and (b) not readily assignable to the cost objectives specifically benefited, without effort disproportionate to the result achieved. The term indirect cost as used herein applies to costs of this type originating in the State agency, as well as those incurred by other departments in supplying goods, services, and facilities, to the State agency. To facilitate equitable distribution of indirect expenses to the cost objectives served, it may be necessary to establish a number of pools of indirect costs within a State agency or in other agencies providing services to a State agency. Indirect cost pools should be distributed to benefiting cost objectives on bases which will produce an equitable result in consideration of relative benefits derived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> State agency indirect costs. All State agency indirect costs, including the various levels of supervision, are eligible for allocation to the program provided they meet the conditions set forth in their principles. In lieu of determining the actual amount of State agency indirect cost allocable to the program the following methods may be used:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Predetermined fixed rates for indirect costs. A predetermined fixed rate for computing indirect costs applicable to program administration may be negotiated annually in situations where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to enable the parties to reach an informed judgment (1) as to the probable level of indirect costs in the State agency during the period to be covered by the negotiated rate, and (2) that the amount allowable under the predetermined rate would not exceed actual indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Negotiated lump sum for overhead. A negotiated fixed amount in lieu of indirect costs may be appropriate under circumstances where the benefits derived from a State agency's indirect services cannot be readily determined as in the case of a small self-contained or isolated activity. When this method is used, a determination should be made that the amount negotiated will be approximately the same as the actual indirect cost that may be incurred. Such amounts negotiated in lieu of indirect costs will be treated as an offset to total indirect expenses of the State agency before allocation to remaining activities. The base on which such remaining expenses are allocated should be appropriately adjusted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitation on indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Some Federal programs may be subject to laws that limit the amount of indirect cost that may be allowed. Agencies that sponsor programs of this type will establish procedures which will assure that the amount actually allowed for indirect costs under each such program does not exceed the maximum allowable under the statutory limitation or the amount otherwise allowable under these principles, whichever is the smaller.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When the amount allowable under a statutory limitation is less than the amount otherwise allocable as indirect costs under these principles, the amount not recoverable as indirect costs under a program may not be shifted to another federally sponsored program or contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Cost incurred by other agencies of the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. The cost of service provided by other agencies may only include allowable direct costs of the service plus a pro rata share of allowable supporting costs and supervision directly required in performing the service, but not supervision of a general nature such as that provided by the head of a department and his staff assistants not directly involved in operations. However, supervision by the head of a department or agency whose sole function is providing the service furnished would be an eligible cost. Supporting costs include those furnished by other units of the supplying department or by other agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Alternative methods of determining indirect cost. In lieu of determining actual indirect cost related to a particular service furnished by other agencies of the State, either of the following alternative methods may be used provided only one method is used for a specific service during the fiscal year involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Standard indirect rate. An amount equal to ten percent of direct labor cost in providing the service performed by other agencies of the State (excluding overtime, shift, or holiday premiums, and fringe benefits) may be allowed in lieu of actual allowable indirect cost for that service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Predetermined fixed rate. A predetermined fixed rate for indirect cost of the unit or activity providing service may be negotiated as set forth in section F(2)(a) of these principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Cost incurred by State agency for others. The principles provided in section G will also be used in determining the cost of services provided by the State agency to another agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Cost allocation plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A cost allocation will be required to support the distribution of any indirect costs. All costs allocable to the Food Stamp Program under cost allocation plans will be supported by formal accounting records which will substantiate the propriety of eventual charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> There are two types of cost allocation plans:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Statewide or central service cost allocation plan identifies and distributes the

cost of services provided by support organizations to those departments or units participating in Federal programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Indirect cost proposals distribute the administrative or joint costs incurred by the State agency and the cost of service allocable to it under the Statewide or central service cost allocation plan in a ratio to all work performed by the State agency. The process involves applying a percentage relationship of indirect cost to direct cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Requirements. The cost allocation plan of the State agency shall cover all allocated costs of the department as well as costs to be allocated under plans of other agencies or organizational units which are to be included in the costs of federally sponsored programs. The cost allocation plans of all the agencies rendering services to the State agency, to the extent feasible, should be presented in a single document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Instructions for preparation of cost allocation plans. The Department of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the other Federal agencies concerned, will be responsible for developing and issuing the instructions for use by State agencies in preparation of cost allocation plans. This responsibility applies to both central support services at the State and local government level and indirect cost proposals of individual State agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Submitting plans for approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Responsibility for approving cost allocation plans for individual State agencies has been assigned by the Office of Management and Budget to the cognizant Federal agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> State cost allocation plans must be submitted to the cognizant Federal agency within six months after the last day of the State's fiscal year. Upon request by the State agency, an extension of time for submittal of the cost allocation plan may be granted by the cognizant Federal agency. It is essential that cost allocation plans be submitted in a timely manner. Failure to submit the plans when required will cause the State agency to become delinquent. In the event a State becomes delinquent, FNS will not provide for the recovery of central service and indirect costs, and such costs already made and claimed against Food Stamp Program funds will be subject to disallowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Negotiation and approval of cost allocation plans for States. The cognizant Federal agency, in collaboration with Federal agencies concerned, will be responsible for negotiation, approval, and audit of cost allocation plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Negotiation and approval of cost allocation plans for local governments. Cost allocation plans will be retained at the local government level for audit by the cognizant Federal agency except in those cases where that agency requests that cost allocation plans be submitted to it for negotiation and approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A current list of cognizant Federal agencies is maintained by the Office of Management and Budget.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Resolution of problems. The Office of Management and Budget will lend assistance in resolving problems encountered by Federal agencies on cost allocation plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Approval by FNS. FNS reserves the right to disapprove costs not meeting the general criteria outlined in section C of these principles. FNS shall promptly notify the State agency in writing of the disapproval, the reason for the disapproval and the effective date. Costs incurred by State agencies after disapproval may not be charged to FNS unless if FNS subsequently approves the cost.</p><p class="depth0">Standards for Selected Items of Cost</p><p class="depth0">A. Allowable cost. Standards for allowability of costs are established by Federal Management Circular 74-4. These standards will apply regardless of whether a particular item of cost is treated as direct or indirect. Failure to mention a particular item of cost in these standards is not intended to imply that it is either allowable or unallowable. Rather, determination of allowability in each case should be based on the treatment of standards provided for similar or related items of cost. The allowability of the selected items of cost is subject to the general policies and principles as stated in Attachment A to Federal Management Circular 74-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Accounting. The cost of establishing and maintaining accounting and other information systems required for the management of the Food Stamp Program is allowable. This includes costs incurred by central service agencies of the State government for these purposes. The cost of maintaining central accounting records required for overall State or local government purposes, such as appropriation and fund accounts by the Treasurer, Comptroller, or similar officials, is considered to be a general expense of government and is not allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Advertising. Advertising media includes newspapers, magazines, radio and television programs, direct mail, trade papers, and the like. The advertising costs allowable are those which are solely for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Recruitment of personnel required for the Program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Solicitation of bids for the procurement of goods and services required;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disposal of scrap or surplus materials acquired in the performance of the agreement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Other purposes specifically provided for by FNS regulations or approved by FNS in the administration of the Food Stamp Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Advisory councils. Costs incurred by State advisory councils or committees established to carry out Food Stamp Program goals are allowable. The cost of like organizations is allowable when used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Audit service. The cost of audits necessary for the administration and management of functions related to the Program is allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Bonding. Costs of premiums on bonds covering employees who handle Food Stamp Program funds or food coupons are allowable. The amount of allowable coverage shall be limited to the anticipated maximum amount of food stamp funds or food coupons handled at one time by that employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Budgeting. Costs incurred for the development, preparation, and execution of budgets are allowable. Costs for services of a central budget office are generally not allowable since these are costs of general government. However, where employees of the central budget office actively participate in the State agency's budget process, the cost of services identifiable to the Food Stamp Program are allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Building lease management. The administrative cost for lease management which includes review of lease proposals, maintenance of a list of available property for lease, and related activities is allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Central stores. The cost of maintaining and operating a central stores organization for supplies, equipment, and materials used either directly or indirectly for the Food Stamp Program is allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Communications. Communication costs incurred for telephone calls or service, telegraph, teletype service, wide area telephone service (WATS), centrex, telpak (tie lines), postage, messenger service and similar expenses are allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Compensation for personal services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Compensation for personal services includes all remuneration, paid currently or accrued, for services rendered during the period of performance in the administration of the program including but not necessarily limited to wages, salaries, and supplementary compensation and benefits as defined in section A.(13) of these principles. The costs of such compensation are allowable to the extent that total compensation for individual employees: is reasonable for the services rendered; follows an appointment made in accordance with State or local government laws and rules and which meets Federal Merit System or other requirements, where applicable; and is determined and supported as provided in section A of these principles. Compensation for employees engaged in federally assisted activities will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is consistent with that paid for similar work in other activities of the State or local government. In cases where the kinds of employees required for the Food Stamp Program activities are not found in the other activities of the State or local government, compensation will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is comparable to that paid for similar work in the labor market in which the employing government competes for the kind of employees involved. Compensation surveys providing data representative of the labor market involved will be an acceptable basis for evaluating reasonableness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Payroll and distribution of time. Amounts charged to the program for personal services, regardless of whether treated as direct or indirect costs, will be based on payrolls documented and approved in accordance with the generally accepted practice of the State or local agency. Payrolls must be supported by time and attendence or equivalent records for individual employees. Distribution of salaries and wages of employees chargeable to more than one program or other cost objective will be supported by appropriate time reports or approved time study methodologies. The method used should be included in the cost allocation plan and should be approved by FNS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Depreciation and use allowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> State agencies may be compensated for the use of buildings, capital improvements, and equipment through use allowances or depreciation. Use allowances are the means of providing compensation in lieu of depreciation or other equivalent costs. However, a combination of the two methods may not be used in connection with a single class of fixed assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The computation of depreciation or use allowances will be based on acquisition cost. Where actual cost records have not been maintained, a reasonable estimate of the original acquisition cost may be used in the computation. The computation will exclude the cost of any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment donated or borne directly or indirectly by the Federal Government through charges to Federal programs or otherwise, irrespective of where title was originally vested or where it presently resides. In addition, the computation will also exclude the cost of acquisition of land. Depreciation or a use allowance on idle or excess facilities is not allowable, except when specifically authorized by FNS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Where the depreciation method is followed, adequate property records must be maintained, and any generally accepted method of computing depreciation may be used. However, the method of computing depreciation must be consistently applied for any specific asset or class of assets for all affected federally sponsored programs and must result in equitable charges considering the extent of the use of the assets for the benefit of such programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In lieu of depreciation, a use allowance for buildings and improvements may be computed at an annual rate not exceeding two percent of acquisition cost. The use allowance for equipment (excluding items properly capitalized as building cost) will be computed at an annual rate not exceeding six and two-thirds percent of acquisition cost of usable equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> No depreciation or use charge may be allowed on any assets that would be considered as fully depreciated, provided, however, that reasonable use charges may be negotiated for any such assets if warranted after taking into consideration the cost of the facility or item involved, the estimated useful life remaining at time of negotiation, the effect of any increased maintenance charges or decreased efficiency due to age, and any other factors pertinent to the utilization of the facility or item for the purpose contemplated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Disbursing service. The cost of disbursing program funds by the State Treasurer or other designated officer is allowable. Disbursing services cover the processing of checks or warrants, from preparation to redemption, including the necessary records of accountability and reconciliation of such records with related cash accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Employee fringe benefits. Costs identified are allowable to the extent that total compensation for employees is reasonable as defined in paragraph (10)(a) of these principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Employee benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to employees during periods of authorized absences from the job, such as for annual leave, sick leave, court leave, military leave, and the like, if they are provided pursuant to an approved leave system, and the cost thereof is equitably allocated to all related activities, including federally assisted programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Employee benefits in the form of employers' contributions or expense for social security, employees' life and health insurance plans, unemployment insurance coverage, workers' compensation insurance, pension plans, severance pay, and the like, provided such benefits are granted under approved plans and are distributed equitably to programs and to other activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Employee morale, health And welfare costs. The costs of health or first-aid clinics and/or infirmaries, recreational facilities, employees' counseling services, employee information publications, and any related expenses incurred in accordance with general State or local policy, are allowable. Income generated from any of these activities will be offset against expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Exhibits. Costs of exhibits relating specifically to the Food Stamp Program are allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Legal expenses. The cost of legal expenses required in the administration of the program is allowable. Legal services furnished by the chief legal officer of a State or local government or his staff solely for the purpose of discharging his general responsibilities as legal officer are unallowable. Legal expenses for the prosecution of claims against the Federal Government is unallowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Maintenance and repair. Costs incurred for necessary maintenance, repair, or upkeep of property which neither add to the permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolong its intended life, but keep it in an efficient operating condition, are allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Materials and supplies. The cost of materials and supplies necessary to carry out the program is allowable. Purchases made specifically for the program should be charged thereto at their actual prices after deducting all cash discounts, trade discounts, rebates, and allowances received by the State agency. Withdrawals from general stores or stockrooms should be charged at cost under any recognized method of pricing consistently applied. Incoming transportation charges are a proper part of material cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Memberships, subscriptions and professional activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The cost of membership in civic, business, technical, and professional organizations is allowable, provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The benefit from the membership is related to the program,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The expenditure is for agency membership,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The cost of the membership is reasonably related to the value of the services or benefits received, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The expenditure is not for membership in an organization which devotes a substantial part of its activities to influencing legislation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reference material.
