Where:
GCH4 = Modeled methane generation rate in reporting year T</p><p class="depth0">(metric tons CH4).x = Year in which waste was disposed.S = Start year of calculation. Use the year 1960 or the opening year of</p><p class="depth0">the landfill, whichever is more recent.T = Reporting year for which emissions are calculated.WX = Quantity of waste disposed in the landfill in year x</p><p class="depth0">from measurement data, tipping fee receipts, or other company</p><p class="depth0">records (metric tons, as received (wet weight)).MCF = Methane correction factor (fraction). Use the default value of 1</p><p class="depth0">unless there is active aeration of waste within the landfill</p><p class="depth0">during the reporting year. If there is active aeration of</p><p class="depth0">waste within the landfill during the reporting year, use</p><p class="depth0">either the default value of 1 or select an alternative value</p><p class="depth0">no less than 0.5 based on site-specific aeration parameters.DOC = Degradable organic carbon from Table HH-1 of this subpart</p><p class="depth0">[fraction (metric tons C/metric ton waste)].DOCF = Fraction of DOC dissimilated (fraction).

Use the appropriate parameter values for k, DOC, MCF, DOCF, and F shown in Table HH-1 of this subpart. The annual quantity of each type of waste disposed must be calculated as the sum of the

daily quantities of waste (of that type) disposed. You may use the bulk waste parameters for a portion of your waste materials when using the material-specific modeling approach for mixed waste streams that cannot be designated to a specific material type. For years when waste composition data are not available, use the bulk waste parameter values for k and DOC in Table HH-1 to this subpart for the total quantity of waste disposed in those years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Beginning in the first emissions reporting year and for each year thereafter, if scales are in place, you must determine the annual quantity of waste (in metric tons as received, i.e., wet weight) disposed of in the landfill using paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section for all containers and for all vehicles used to haul waste to the landfill, except for passenger cars, light duty pickup trucks, or waste loads that cannot be measured using the scales due to physical limitations (load cannot physically access or fit on the scale) and/or operational limitations of the scale (load exceeding the limits or sensitivity range of the scale). If scales are not in place, you must use paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section to determine the annual quantity of waste disposed. For waste hauled to the landfill in passenger cars or light duty pickup trucks, you may use either paragraph (a)(3)(i) or paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section to determine the annual quantity of waste disposed. For loads that cannot be measured using the scales due to physical and/or operational limitations of the scale, you must use paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section or similar engineering calculations to determine the annual quantity of waste disposed. The approach used to determine the annual quantity of waste disposed of must be documented in the monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use direct mass measurements of each individual load received at the landfill using either of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Weigh using mass scales each vehicle or container used to haul waste as it enters the landfill or disposal area; weigh using mass scales each vehicle or container after it has off-loaded the waste; determine the quantity of waste received from the individual load as the difference in the two mass measurements; and determine the annual quantity of waste received as the sum of all waste loads received during the year. Alternatively, you may determine annual quantity of waste by summing the weights of all vehicles and containers entering the landfill and subtracting from it the sum of all the weights of vehicles and containers after they have off-loaded the waste in the landfill.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Weigh using mass scales each vehicle or container used to haul waste as it enters the landfill or disposal area; determine a representative tare weight by vehicle or container type by weighing no less than 5 of each type of vehicle or container after it has off-loaded the waste; determine the quantity of waste received from the individual load as the difference between the measured weight in and the tare weight determined for that container/vehicle type; and determine the annual quantity of waste received as the sum of all waste loads received during the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determine the working capacity in units of mass for each type of container or vehicle used to haul waste to the landfill (e.g., using volumetric capacity and waste density measurements; direct measurement of a selected number of passenger vehicles and light duty pick-up trucks; or similar methods); record the number of loads received at the landfill by vehicle/container type; calculate the annual mass per vehicle/container type as the mass product of the number of loads of that vehicle/container multiplied by its working capacity; and calculate the annual quantity of waste received as the sum of the annual mass per vehicle/container type across all of the vehicle/container types used to haul waste to the landfill.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For years prior to the first emissions reporting year, use methods in paragraph (a)(3) of this section when waste disposal quantity data are readily available. When waste disposal quantity data are not readily available, WX shall be estimated using one of the applicable methods in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iii) of this section. You must determine which method is most applicable to the conditions

and disposal history of your facility. Historical waste disposal quantities should only be determined once, as part of the first annual report, and the same values should be used for all subsequent annual reports, supplemented by the next year's data on new waste disposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume all prior years waste disposal quantities are the same as the waste quantity in the first year for which waste quantities are available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use the estimated population served by the landfill in each year, the values for national average per capita waste disposal rates found in Table HH-2 to this subpart, and calculate the waste quantity landfilled using Equation HH-2 of this section.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28OC10.034

If no data are available for</p><p class="depth0">estimating YrOpen for a closed landfill, use 30 years as the</p><p class="depth0">default operating life of the landfill.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For landfills with gas collection systems, calculate the quantity of CH4 destroyed according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If you continuously monitor the flow rate, CH4 concentration, temperature, pressure, and, if necessary, moisture content of the landfill gas that is collected and routed to a destruction device (before any treatment equipment) using a monitoring meter specifically for CH4 gas, as specified in Sec. 98.344, you must use this monitoring system and calculate the quantity of CH4 recovered for destruction using Equation HH-4 of this section.
