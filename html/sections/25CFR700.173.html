                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Computing net earnings. For purposes of this subpart, the  average annual net earnings of a business or farm operation is one-half  of its net earnings before Federal, State and local income taxes, during  the two taxable years immediately prior to the taxable year in which it  was displaced. However, if the business or farm was not in operation for  the full two taxable years prior to displacement, net earnings shall be  computed on the basis of the actual period of operation on the acquired  site, projected to an annual rate. Also, average annual net earnings may  be based upon a different period of time when the Commission determines  it to be more equitable. Net earnings include any compensation obtained  from the business or farm operation by its owner, his spouse, or  dependents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Documentation. A displaced person who elects to receive a fixed  payment in lieu of actual expenses incurred in moving his business or  farm shall furnish the Commission proof of his net earnings through  income tax returns, certified financial statements or other reasonable  evidence.</p>
