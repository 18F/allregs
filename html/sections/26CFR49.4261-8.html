                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In addition to a payment specifically exempt under section 4263,  4292, 4293, or 4294 the following are examples of payments not subject  to tax:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exchange of prepaid order, scrip, etc., for tickets. A ticket  issued pursuant to an exchange order, prepaid order, airline pilot  order, or scrip, is not subject to tax where the tax is paid at the time  of payment for the order or scrip.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Caretakers and messengers accompanying freight shipments. The  tax on the transportation of persons does not apply to amounts paid for  transportation of freight that includes also the transportation of  caretakers or messengers for which no specific charge as such is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special baggage transportation equipment. An amount paid for  special baggage transportation equipment is not subject to the tax on  the transportation of persons if separable from the payment for  transportation of persons and if shown in the exact amount of the charge  on the records covering the taxable transportation payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Circus or show conveyances. The amount paid pursuant to a  contract for the movement of a circus or show conveyance where the  amount covers only the transportation of the performers, laborers,  animals, equipment, etc., by such conveyances is not subject to the tax  on the transportation of persons imposed by section 4261. However, if  the contract payment also covers the issuance to advance agents, bill  posters, etc., of circus or show scrip books, or other evidence of the  right to transportation, for use on regular passenger conveyances, that  portion of the contract payment properly allocable to such scrip books  or other evidence is subject to the tax on the transportation of  persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Corpses. The tax on the transportation of persons does not apply  to the amount paid for the transportation of a corpse, but does apply to  the amount paid for the transportation of any person accompanying the  corpse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Miscellaneous charges. Where the charge is separable from the  payment for the transportation of a person and is shown in the exact  amount thereof on the records pertaining to the transportation payment,  the tax on the transportation of persons does not   apply to the following and similar charges:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Charges for transportation of baggage, including incidental  charges such as excess value, storage, transfer, parcel checking,  special delivery, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Charges for transportation of an automobile in connection with  the transportation of a person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Charges for bridge or road toll, or a ferry charge of 60 cents  or less, made in connection with the transportation beginning before  November 16, 1962, of a person by bus. Charges incurred by the carrier  which are part of its costs of operation, such as bridge tolls, road  tolls, or ferry charges, paid by the carrier on account of the bus and  driver, cannot be deducted from the charge made to the passenger in  determining the taxable charges for transportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Charges for admissions, guides, meals, hotel accommodations, and  other nontransportation services, for example, where such items are  included in a lump sum payment for an all-expense tour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Charges in connection with the charter of a land, water, or air  conveyance for the transportation of persons beginning before November  16, 1962, or an air conveyance for transportation of persons which  begins after November 15, 1962, such as for parking, icing, sanitation,  ``layover'' or ``waiting time'', movement of equipment in deadhead  service, dockage, or wharfage, etc.  [T.D. 6430, 24 FR 9665, Dec. 3, 1959, as amended by T.D. 6618, 27 FR  11223, Nov. 14, 1962]</p>
