Upon such termination, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: Provided, That to the extent practicable, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part.
