                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Producers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Counting the ballots. Under the supervision of  FSA CED, acting on behalf of the Administrator, AMS, the in-person  registration and certification form envelopes (Form LS-72-2) and the  absentee ``Pork Referendum'' envelopes (Form LS-73-1) containing the  ``Pork Ballot'' envelopes for producer voters will be checked against  the In-Person Voter Registration List (Form LS-75) and the Absentee  Voter Request List (Form LS-74), respectively, to determine properly  registered voters. The ballots of producers voting in-person whose names  are not on the In-Person Voter Registration List (Form LS-75), will be  declared invalid. Likewise, the ballots of producers voting absentee  whose names are not on the Absentee Voter Request List (Form LS-74) will  be declared invalid. All ballots of challenged producer voters declared  ineligible and invalid ballots will be kept separate from the other  ballots and the envelopes containing these ballots will not be opened.  The valid ballots will be counted on November 29, 2000, during regular  business hours on the 46th business day after the last day of the in- person voting period. FSA county office employees will remove the sealed  ``Pork Ballot'' envelopes (Form LS-72-1) from the registration form  envelopes and ``Pork Referendum'' envelopes (absentee voting) envelopes  of all eligible producer voters and all challenged producer voters  determined to be eligible. After removing all ``Pork Ballot'' envelopes,  FSA county employees will shuffle the sealed ``Pork Ballot'' envelopes  or otherwise mix them up so that ballots cannot be matched with  producers' names. After shuffling the ``Pork Ballot'' envelopes, FSA  county employees will open them and count the ballots. The ballots will  be counted as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Number of eligible producers casting valid ballots;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Number of producers favoring continuation of the Pork Checkoff  Program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Number of producers favoring termination of the Pork Checkoff  Program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Number of challenged producer ballots deemed ineligible;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Number of invalid ballots; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Number of spoiled ballots.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Invalid ballots. Ballots will be declared invalid if a producer  voting in-person has failed to print his or her name and address on the  In-Person Voter Registration List (Form LS-75) or if an absentee voter's  name and address is not recorded on the Absentee Voter Request List  (Form LS-74), or the registration form or ballot was incomplete or  incorrectly completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Spoiled ballots. Ballots will be considered spoiled if they are  mutilated or marked in such a way that it cannot be determined whether  the voter is voting ``yes'' or ``no.'' Spoiled ballots shall not be  considered as approving or disapproving the Pork Checkoff Program, or as  a ballot cast in the referendum.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Confidentiality. All ballots shall be confidential and the  contents of the ballots not divulged except as the Secretary may direct.  The public may witness the opening of the ballot box and the counting of  the votes but may not interfere with the process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Importers--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Counting the ballots. FSA headquarters personnel,  acting on behalf of the Administrator, AMS, will   check the registration forms and ballots for all importer voters against  the Importer Ballot Request List (Form LS-77) to determine properly  registered voters. The ballots of importers voting whose names are not  recorded on the Importer Ballot Request List (Form LS-77), will be  declared invalid. All ballots of importer voters declared invalid will  be kept separate from the other ballots and the envelopes containing  these ballots will not be opened. The valid ballots will be counted on  November 29, 2000, during regular office hours on the 46th business day  after the date of the last day of the in-person voting period. FSA  headquarter office employees will remove the sealed ``Pork Ballot''  envelope (Form LS-72-1) from the ``Pork Referendum'' envelopes (Form LS- 73-1) of all eligible importer voters. After removing all ``Pork  Ballot'' envelopes, FSA headquarter employees will shuffle the sealed  ``Pork Ballot'' envelopes or otherwise mix them up so that ballots  cannot be matched with importers' names.
