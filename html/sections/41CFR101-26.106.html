                                Sec. 101-26.106  Consolidation of requirements.

                            <p class="depth0">Full consideration shall be given to the consolidation of individual  small volume requirements to enable the Government to benefit from lower  prices normally obtainable through definite quantity contracts for  larger volume procurements. This policy pertains to procurement from  commercial sources either directly or through an intermediary agency and  does not apply to GSA stock items or small volume requirements normally  obtained from GSA customer supply centers. When it is practical, each  agency shall establish procedures that will permit planned requirements  consolidation on an agencywide basis. When it is impractical to plan  requirements on an agencywide consolidated basis, the requirements  consolidation effort may be limited to a bureau, to other agency  segments, or to a program, if such limited consolidation will provide  significant price advantages when procurement is effected on a volume  basis. Requisitions for item requirements exceeding maximum order  limitations in Federal Supply Schedule contracts shall be submitted to  GSA in accordance with the applicable instructions in the respective  schedules. Special buying services desired by agencies for procurement  of other consolidated item requirements shall be requested from GSA in  accordance with Sec. 101-26.102.
