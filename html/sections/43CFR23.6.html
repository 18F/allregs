                            <p class="depth0">An application or offer for a permit, lease, or contract to conduct  exploratory or extractive operations may be denied any applicant or  offeror who has forfeited a required bond because of failure to comply  with an exploration or mining plan. However, a permit, lease, or  contract may not be denied an applicant or offeror because of the  forfeiture of a bond if the lands disturbed under his previous permit,  lease, or contract have subsequently been reclaimed without cost to the  Federal Government.</p>
