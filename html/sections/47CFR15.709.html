                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Power limits for TVBDs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For fixed TVBDs, the maximum power  delivered to the transmitting antenna shall not exceed one watt per 6  megahertz of bandwidth on which the device operates. The power delivered  to the transmitting antenna is the maximum conducted output power  reduced by the signal loss experienced in the cable used to connect the  transmitter to the transmit antenna. If transmitting antennas of  directional gain greater than 6 dBi are used, the maximum conducted  output power shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the directional  gain of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For personal/portable TVBDs, the maximum EIRP shall not exceed  100 milliwatts (20 dBm) per 6 megahertz of bandwidth on which the device  operates with the following exceptions; Mode II personal/portable TVBDs  that do not meet the adjacent channel separation requirements in  Sec. 15.712(a) and Mode I personal/portable TVBDs that operate on  available channels (provided by a Mode II TVBD) that do not meet the  adjacent channel separation requirements of Sec. 15.712(a) are limited  to a maximum EIRP of 40 milliwatts (16 dBm) per 6 megahertz of bandwidth  on which the device operates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> TVBDs shall incorporate transmit power control to limit their  operating power to the minimum necessary for successful communication.  Applicants for equipment certification shall include a description of a  device's transmit power control feature mechanism.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Maximum conducted output power is the total transmit power over  the occupied bandwidth delivered to all antennas and antenna elements  averaged across all symbols in the signaling alphabet when the  transmitter is operating at its maximum power control level. Power must  be summed across all antennas and antenna elements. The average must not  include any time intervals during which the transmitter is off or is  transmitting at a reduced power level. If multiple modes of operation  are possible (e.g., alternative modulation methods), the maximum  conducted output power is the highest total transmit power occurring in  any mode.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The power spectral density from the TVBD shall not be greater  than the following values when measured in any 100 kHz band during any  time interval of continuous transmission.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fixed devices: 12.6 dBm conducted power. If transmitting  antennas of directional gain greater than 6 dBi are used, this conducted  power level shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the directional  gain of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Personal/portable device operating adjacent to occupied TV  channels: -1.4 dBm EIRP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Sensing-only devices: -0.4 dBm EIRP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All other personal/portable devices: 2.6 dBm EIRP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> TVBDs shall incorporate adequate security measures to prevent  the   TVBD from accessing databases not approved by the FCC and to ensure that  unauthorized parties can not modify the TVBD or configure its control  features to operate inconsistent with the rules and protection criteria  set forth in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Antenna requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All transmit and receive antenna(s) of  personal/portable devices shall be permanently attached.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The transmit antenna used with fixed devices may not be more  than 30 meters above the ground. In addition, fixed devices may not be  located at sites where the antenna height above average terrain is more  than 250 meters. The HAAT is to be calculated by the TV bands database  that the device contacts for available channels using computational  software employing the methodology in Sec. 73.684(d) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For personal/portable TVBDs operating under Sec. 15.717, the  provisions of Sec. 15.204(c)(4) do not apply to an antenna used for  transmission and reception/spectrum sensing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For personal/portable TVBDs operating under Sec. 15.717 that  incorporate a separate sensing antenna, compliance testing shall be  performed using the lowest gain antenna for each type of antenna to be  certified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Emission limits for TVBDs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the television channels  immediately adjacent to the channel in which the TVBD is operating,  emissions from the TVBD shall not exceed the following levels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fixed devices: -42.8 dBm conducted power.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Personal/portable device operating adjacent to occupied TV  channels: -56.8 dBm EIRP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Sensing-only devices: -55.8 dBm EIRP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All other personal/portable devices: -52.8 dBm EIRP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Emission measurements in the adjacent channels shall be  performed using a minimum resolution bandwidth of 100 kHz with an  average detector. A narrower resolution bandwidth may be employed near  the band edge, when necessary, provided the measured energy is  integrated to show the total power over 100 kHz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At frequencies beyond the television channels immediately  adjacent to the channel in which the TVBD is operating, the radiated  emissions from TVBDs shall meet the requirements of Sec. 15.209.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Emissions in the band 602-620 MHz must also comply with the  following field strength limits at a distance of one meter.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Field strength dBV/meter/</p><p class="depth3">Frequency (MHz)                          120 kHz ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 602-607.............................  120-5[F(MHz)-602] 607-608.............................  95 608-614.............................  30 614-615.............................  95 615-620.............................  120-5[620-F(MHz)] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> TVBDs connected to the AC power line are required to comply with  the conducted limits set forth in Sec. 15.207.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Compliance with radio frequency exposure requirements. To ensure  compliance with the Commission's radio frequency exposure requirements  in Secs. 1.1307(b), 2.1091 and 2.1093 of this chapter, fixed TVBDs shall  be accompanied by instructions on measures to take to ensure that  persons maintain a distance of at least 40 cm from the device, as well  as any necessary hardware that may be needed to implement that  protection. These instructions shall be submitted with the application  for certification. Personal/portable TVBDs that meet the definition of  portable devices under Sec. 2.1093 of this chapter and that operate with  a source-based time-averaged output of less than 20 mW will not be  subject to routine evaluation for compliance with the radio frequency  exposure guidelines, while devices that operate with a source-based  time-average output power greater than 20 mW will be subject to the  routine evaluation requirements.
