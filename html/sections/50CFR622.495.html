The trip limit of paragraph (b) of this section  applies to a vessel that has at least one person on board with a valid  commercial fishing license issued by Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin  Islands. If no person on board the vessel has a valid commercial fishing  license issued by Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, the bag limit  specified in Sec. 622.494(b) applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Trip limit.
