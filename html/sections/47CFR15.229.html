The provisions in Sec. 15.35 for limiting peak emissions apply where compliance of these devices is demonstrated under this alternative emission limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The field strength of any emissions appearing outside of this band shall not exceed the general radiated emission limits in Sec. 15.209.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The frequency tolerance of the carrier signal shall be maintained within [0.01% of the operating frequency over a temperature variation of -20 degrees to + 50 degrees C at normal supply voltage, and for a variation in the primary supply voltage from 85% to 115% of the rated supply voltage at a temperature of 20 degrees C. For battery operated equipment, the equipment tests shall be performed using a new battery.
