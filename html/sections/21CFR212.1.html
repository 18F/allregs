Other definitions of these words may apply when they  are used in other parts of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Acceptance criteria means numerical limits, ranges, or other  criteria for tests that are used for or in making a decision to accept  or reject a unit, lot, or batch of a PET drug product.</p><p class="depth0">Act means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (21  U.S.C. 321 et seq.).</p><p class="depth0">Active pharmaceutical ingredient means a substance that is intended  for incorporation into a finished PET drug product and is intended to  furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis  or monitoring of a disease or a manifestation of a disease in humans,  but does not include intermediates used in the synthesis of such  substance.</p><p class="depth0">Batch means a specific quantity of PET drug intended to have uniform  character and quality, within specified limits, that is produced  according to a single production order during the same cycle of  production.</p><p class="depth0">Batch production and control record means a unique record that  references an accepted master production and control record and  documents specific details on production, labeling, and quality control  for a single batch of a PET drug.</p><p class="depth0">Component means any ingredient intended for use in the production of  a PET drug, including any ingredients that may not appear in the final  PET drug product.</p><p class="depth0">Conditional final release means a final release made prior to  completion of a required finished-product test because of a malfunction  involving analytical equipment.</p><p class="depth0">Final release means the authoritative decision by a responsible  person in a PET production facility to permit the use of a batch of a  PET drug in humans.</p><p class="depth0">Inactive ingredient means any intended component of the PET drug  other than the active pharmaceutical ingredient.</p><p class="depth0">In-process material means any material fabricated, compounded,  blended, or derived by chemical reaction that is produced for, and is  used in, the preparation of a PET drug.</p><p class="depth0">Lot means a batch, or a specifically identified portion of a batch,  having uniform character and quality within specified limits. In the  case of a PET drug produced by continuous process, a lot is a  specifically identified amount produced in a unit of time or quantity in  a manner that ensures its having uniform character and quality within  specified limits.</p><p class="depth0">Lot number, control number, or batch number means any distinctive  combination of letters, numbers, or symbols from which the complete  history of the production, processing, packing, holding, and  distribution of a batch or lot of a PET drug can be determined.</p><p class="depth0">Master production and control record means a compilation of  instructions containing the procedures and specifications for the  production of a PET drug.</p><p class="depth0">Material release means the authoritative decision by a responsible  person in a PET production facility to permit the use of a component,  container and closure, in-process material, packaging material, or  labeling in the production of a PET drug.</p><p class="depth0">PET means positron emission tomography.</p><p class="depth0">PET drug means a radioactive drug that exhibits spontaneous  disintegration of unstable nuclei by the emission of positrons and is  used for providing dual photon positron emission tomographic diagnostic  images. The definition includes any nonradioactive reagent, reagent kit,  ingredient, nuclide generator, accelerator, target material, electronic  synthesizer, or other apparatus or computer program to be used in the  preparation of a PET drug. ``PET drug'' includes a ``PET drug product''  as defined in this section.</p><p class="depth0">PET drug product means a finished dosage form of a PET drug, whether  or not in association with one or more other ingredients.</p><p class="depth0">PET drug production facility means a facility that is engaged in the  production of a PET drug.</p><p class="depth0">Production means the manufacturing, compounding, processing,  packaging, labeling, reprocessing, repacking, relabeling, and testing of  a PET drug.</p><p class="depth0">Quality assurance means a system for ensuring the quality of active  ingredients, PET drugs, intermediates, components that yield an active  pharmaceutical ingredient, analytical supplies, and other components,  including container-closure systems and in-process materials, through  procedures, tests, analytical methods, and acceptance criteria.</p><p class="depth0">Receiving facility means any hospital, institution, nuclear  pharmacy, imaging facility, or other entity or part of an entity that  accepts a PET drug product that has been given final release, but does  not include a common or contract carrier that transports a PET drug  product from a PET production facility to a receiving facility.</p><p class="depth0">Specifications means the tests, analytical procedures, and  appropriate acceptance criteria to which a PET drug, PET drug product,  component, container-closure system, in-process material, or other  material used in PET drug production must conform to be considered  acceptable for its intended use. Conformance to specifications means  that a PET drug, PET drug product, component, container-closure system,  in-process material, or other material used in PET drug production, when  tested according to the described analytical procedures, meets the  listed acceptance criteria.</p><p class="depth0">Strength means the concentration of the active pharmaceutical  ingredient (radioactivity amount per volume or weight at the time of  calibration).</p><p class="depth0">Sub-batch means a quantity of PET drug having uniform character and  quality, within specified limits, that is produced during one succession  of multiple irradiations, using a given synthesis and/or purification  operation.</p><p class="depth0">Verification means confirmation that an established method, process,  or system meets predetermined acceptance criteria.</p>
