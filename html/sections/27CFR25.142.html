                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Label requirements. Each bottle of beer shall show by label or  otherwise   the name or trade name of the brewer, the net contents of the bottle,  the nature of the product such as beer, ale, porter, stout, etc., and  the place of production (city and, when necessary for identification,  State). No statement as to payment of internal revenue taxes may be  shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Breweries of same ownership. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If two or more breweries are  owned or operated by the same person, firm, or corporation (as defined  in Sec. 25.181), the place of production:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> May be shown as the only location on the label;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> May be included in a listing of the locations of breweries  qualified under this part if the place of production is not given less  emphasis than any of the other locations; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Need not be shown if the brewer's principal place of business  is shown in lieu of any other location. The brewer's principal place of  business will be the location of a brewery operated by the brewer and  qualified under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the location of two or more breweries is shown on the label  (paragraph (b)(1)(ii)), or if the brewer's principal place of business  is shown on the label in lieu of the actual place of production  (paragraph (b)(1)(iii)), the brewer shall indicate the actual place of  production by printing, coding or other markings on the label, bottle,  crown or lid. The coding system employed will permit an appropriate TTB  officer to determine the place of production (including street address  if two or more breweries are located in the same city) of the beer. The  brewer must notify the appropriate TTB offcer prior to employing a  coding system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Distinctive names. If the brewer's name, trade name or brand  name includes the name of a city which is not the place where the beer  was produced, the appropriate TTB officer may require the brewer to  state the actual place of production on the label.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tolerances. The statement of net contents shall indicate exactly  the volume of beer within the bottle except for variations in measuring  as may occur in filling conducted in compliance with good commercial  practice. The barrel equivalent of bottles filled during a consecutive  three month period, calculated on the basis of the brewer's fill test  records, may not vary more than 0.5 percent from the barrel equivalent  of bottles filled during the same period, calculated on the basis of the  stated net contents of the bottles. The brewer is liable for the tax on  the entire amount of beer removed, without benefit of tolerance, when  the fill of bottles and cans exceeds the tolerance for the three month  period, or when filling is not conducted in compliance with good  commercial practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Label approval required. Labels used by brewers shall be covered  by certificates of label approval, Form 5100.31, when required by part 7  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Short-fill bottles. A brewer may dispose of taxpaid short-fill  bottles of beer to employees for their use but not for resale. These  bottles need not be labeled, but if labeled they need not show an  accurate statement of net contents.
