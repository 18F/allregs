                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Who is eligible for CSFP? To be eligible for CSFP, individuals must be at least 60 years of age and meet the income eligibility requirements outlined in paragraph (c) of this section; or the individual must be a woman, infant, or child who was certified and receiving CSFP benefits as of February 6, 2014, and whose enrollment in CSFP has continued without interruption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> What are the income eligibility requirements for women, infants, and children? (1) The State agency must establish household income limits that are at or below 185 percent of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines published annually by the Department of Health and Human Services, but not below 100 percent of these guidelines. However, the State agency must accept as income-eligible, regardless of actual income, any applicant who is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Certified as eligible to receive food stamps under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) under Part A of Title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), or Medical Assistance (i.e., Medicaid) under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A member of a family that is certified eligible to receive assistance under TANF, or a member of a family in which a pregnant woman or an infant is certified eligible to receive assistance under Medicaid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State agency may consider women, infants, and children participating in another Federal, State, or local food, health, or welfare program as automatically eligible for CSFP if the income eligibility limits for the program are equal to or lower than the established CSFP limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For a pregnant woman, the State agency must count each embryo or fetus in utero as a household member in determining if the household meets the income eligibility standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The eligibility requirements in this section apply only to women, infants, and children who were certified and receiving CSFP benefits as of February 6, 2014, and whose enrollment has continued without interruption. Effective February 7, 2014, no new applications from women, infants, or children may be approved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> What are the income eligibility requirements for elderly persons? The State agency must use a household income limit at or below 130 percent of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines. Elderly persons in households with income at or below this level must be considered eligible for CSFP benefits (assuming they meet other requirements contained in this part). However, elderly persons certified before September 17, 1986 (i.e., under the three elderly pilot projects) must remain subject to the eligibility criteria in effect at the time of their certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> When must the State agency revise the CSFP income guidelines to reflect the annual adjustments of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines? Each year, FNS will notify State agencies, by memorandum, of adjusted income guidelines by household size at 185 percent, 130 percent, and 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines. The memorandum will reflect the annual adjustments to the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Human Services. The State agency must implement the adjusted guidelines for elderly applicants immediately upon receipt of the memorandum. However, for the recertification of women, infants, and children, the State agency must implement the adjusted guidelines at the same time that the WIC agency implements the adjusted guidelines in WIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> How is income defined and considered as it relates to CSFP eligibility? (1) Income means gross income before deductions for such items as income taxes, employees' social security taxes, insurance premiums, and bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State agency may exclude from consideration the following sources of income listed under the WIC regulations at Sec. 246.7(d)(2)(iv) of this chapter:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any basic allowance for housing received by military services personnel residing off military installations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The value of inkind housing and other inkind benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The State agency must exclude from consideration all income sources excluded by legislation, which are listed in Sec. 246.7(d)(2)(iv)(D) of this chapter. FNS will notify State agencies of any new forms of income excluded by statute through program policy memoranda.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The State agency may authorize local agencies to consider the household's average income during the previous 12 months and current household income to determine which more accurately reflects the household's status. In instances in which the State makes the decision to authorize local agencies to determine a household's income in this manner, all local agencies must comply with the State's decision and apply this method of income determination in situations in which it is warranted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> What other options does the State agency have in establishing eligibility requirements for CSFP? (1) The State agency may require that an individual be at nutritional risk, as determined by a physician or by local agency staff.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State agency may require that an individual reside within the service area of the local agency at the time of application for CSFP benefits. However, the State agency may not require that an individual reside within the area for any fixed period of time.
