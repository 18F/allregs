                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All chest radiographs which are first classified by an A or B  Reader will be submitted by NIOSH to a B Reader qualified as described  in Sec.  37.52. If there is agreement between the two classifications,  as described in paragraph (b) of this section, the result will be  considered final and reported to MSHA for transmittal to the miner. When  agreement is lacking, NIOSH must obtain a third classification from the  panel of B Readers. If any two of the three classifications demonstrate  agreement, the result must be considered the final determination. If  agreement is lacking among the three classifications, NIOSH will obtain  independent classifications from two additional B Readers selected from  the panel, and the final determination will be the median category  derived from the total of five classifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Two classifications must be considered to be in agreement when  they are derived from complete classifications recorded using approved  paper or electronic versions of the Chest Radiograph Classification Form  (Form CDC/NIOSH (M)2.8) and received by NIOSH, and both find either  stage A, B, or C complicated pneumoconiosis, or, for simple  pneumoconiosis, are both in the same major category or (with one  exception noted below) are within one minor category (ILO Classification  12-point scale) of each other. In the last situation, the higher of the  two classifications must be reported. The only exception to the one  minor category principle is a reading sequence of \0/1\, \1/0\,   or \1/0\, \0/1\, which is not considered agreement.
