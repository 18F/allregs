                            <p class="depth0">Each application for a license under this part must include a Safety Analysis Report describing the proposed ISFSI or MRS for the receipt, handling, packaging, and storage of spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, and/or reactor-related GTCC waste as appropriate, including how the ISFSI or MRS will be operated. The minimum information to be included in this report must consist of the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A description and safety assessment of the site on which the ISFSI or MRS is to be located, with appropriate attention to the design bases for external events. Such assessment must contain an analysis and evaluation of the major structures, systems, and components of the ISFSI or MRS that bear on the suitability of the site when the ISFSI or MRS is operated at its design capacity. If the proposed ISFSI or MRS is to be located on the site of a nuclear power plant or other licensed facility, the potential interactions between the ISFSI or MRS and such other facility--including shared common utilities and services--must be evaluated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A description and discussion of the ISFSI or MRS structures with special attention to design and operating characteristics, unusual or novel design features, and principal safety considerations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The design of the ISFSI or MRS in sufficient detail to support the findings in Sec. 72.40 for the term requested in the application, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The design criteria for the ISFSI or MRS pursuant to subpart F of this part, with identification and justification for any additions to or departures from the general design criteria;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> the design bases and the relation of the design bases to the design criteria;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information relative to materials of construction, general arrangement, dimensions of principal structures, and descriptions of all structures, systems, and components important to safety, in sufficient detail to support a finding that the ISFSI or MRS will satisfy the design bases with an adequate margin for safety; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Applicable codes and standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An analysis and evaluation of the design and performance of structures, systems, and components important to safety, with the objective of assessing the impact on public health and safety resulting from operation of the ISFSI or MRS and including determination of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The margins of safety during normal operations and expected operational occurrences during the life of the ISFSI or MRS; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The adequacy of structures, systems, and components provided for the prevention of accidents and the mitigation of the consequences of accidents, including natural and manmade phenomena and events.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The means for controlling and limiting occupational radiation exposures within the limits given in part 20 of this chapter, and for meeting the objective of maintaining exposures as low as is reasonably achievable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The features of ISFSI or MRS design and operating modes to reduce to the extent practicable radioactive waste volumes generated at the installation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An identification and justification for the selection of those subjects that will be probable license conditions and technical specifications. These subjects must cover the design, construction, preoperational testing, operation, and decommissioning of the ISFSI or MRS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A plan for the conduct of operations, including the planned managerial and administrative controls system, and the applicant's organization, and program for training of personnel pursuant to subpart I.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If the proposed ISFSI or MRS incorporates structures, systems, or components important to safety whose functional adequacy or reliability have not been demonstrated by prior use for that purpose or cannot be demonstrated by reference to performance data in related applications or to widely accepted engineering principles, an identification of these structures, systems, or components along with a schedule showing how safety questions will be resolved prior to the initial receipt of spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, and/or reactor-related GTCC waste as appropriate for storage at the ISFSI or MRS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The technical qualifications of the applicant to engage in the proposed activities, as required by Sec. 72.28.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> A description of the applicant's plans for coping with emergencies, as required by Sec. 72.32.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> A description of the equipment to be installed to maintain control over radioactive materials in gaseous and liquid effluents produced during normal operations and expected operational occurrences. The description must identify the design objectives and the means to be used for keeping levels of radioactive material in effluents to the environment as low as is reasonably achievable and within the exposure limits stated in Sec. 72.104. The description must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An estimate of the quantity of each of the principal radionuclides expected to be released annually to the environment in liquid and gaseous effluents produced during normal ISFSI or MRS operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the equipment and processes used in radioactive waste systems; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A general description of the provisions for packaging, storage, and disposal of solid wastes containing radioactive materials resulting from treatment of gaseous and liquid effluents and from other sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> An analysis of the potential dose equivalent or committed dose equivalent to an individual outside the controlled area from accidents or natural phenomena events that result in the release of radioactive material to the environment or direct radiation from the ISFSI or MRS. The calculations of individual dose equivalent or committed dose equivalent must be performed for direct exposure, inhalation, and ingestion occurring as a result of the postulated design basis event.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> A description of the quality assurance program that satisfies the requirements of subpart G to be applied to the design, fabrication, construction, testing, operation, modification, and decommissioning of the structures, systems, and components of the ISFSI or MRS important to safety. The description must identify the structures, systems, and components important to safety. The program must also apply to managerial and administrative controls used to ensure safe operation of the ISFSI or MRS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> A description of the detailed security measures for physical protection, including design features and the plans required by subpart H. For an application from DOE for an ISFSI or MRS, DOE will provide a description of the physical protection plan for protection against radiological sabotage as required by subpart H.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> A description of the program covering preoperational testing and initial operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> A description of the decommissioning plan required under Sec. 72.30.
