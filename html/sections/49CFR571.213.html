Adjustable seats are in the adjustment position midway between the forwardmost and rearmost positions, and if separately adjustable in a vertical direction, are at the lowest position. If an adjustment position does not exist midway between the forwardmost and rearmost position, the closest adjustment position to the rear of the midpoint is used. Adjustable seat backs are in the manufacturer's nominal design riding position. If such a position is not specified, the seat back is positioned so that the longitudinal center line of the child test dummy's neck is vertical, and if an instrumented test dummy is used, the accelerometer surfaces in the dummy's head and thorax, as positioned in the vehicle, are horizontal.
