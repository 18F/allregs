                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Steep gradient sections of streams are sometimes characterized  by riffle and pool complexes. Such stream sections are recognizable by  their hydraulic characteristics. The rapid movement of water over a  coarse substrate in riffles results in a rough flow, a turbulent  surface, and high dissolved oxygen levels in the water. Pools are deeper  areas associated with riffles. Pools are characterized by a slower  stream velocity, a steaming flow, a smooth   surface, and a finer substrate. Riffle and pool complexes are  particularly valuable habitat for fish and wildlife.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Possible loss of values: Discharge of dredged or fill material  can eliminate riffle and pool areas by displacement, hydrologic  modification, or sedimentation. Activities which affect riffle and pool  areas and especially riffle/pool ratios, may reduce the aeration and  filtration capabilities at the discharge site and downstream, may reduce  stream habitat diversity, and may retard repopulation of the disposal  site and downstream waters through sedimentation and the creation of  unsuitable habitat. The discharge of dredged or fill material which  alters stream hydrology may cause scouring or sedimentation of riffles  and pools. Sedimentation induced through hydrological modification or as  a direct result of the deposition of unconsolidated dredged or fill  material may clog riffle and pool areas, destroy habitats, and create  anaerobic conditions. Eliminating pools and meanders by the discharge of  dredged or fill material can reduce water holding capacity of streams  and cause rapid runoff from a watershed. Rapid runoff can deliver large  quantities of flood water in a short time to downstream areas resulting  in the destruction of natural habitat, high property loss, and the need  for further hydraulic modification.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Possible actions to minimize adverse impacts on site or  material characteristics can be found in subpart H.</p>
