Brief consultation may be obtained at no  charge; the fee for extended effort will be based upon actual costs  incurred. The services outlined in this paragraph do not include  services in connection with legal proceedings not involving the United  States as a named party, nor to testimony or the production of data,  information, or records in such legal proceedings which is governed by  the policies and procedures set forth in Subchapter H, Chapter II, Part  275, of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To enhance the competence of standards laboratory personnel,  NIST conducts at irregular intervals several group seminars on the  precision measurement of specific types of physical quantities, offering  the opportunity of laboratory observation and informal discussion. A  brochure describing the current series of seminars can be obtained by  writing the Office of Measurement Services, National Institute of  Standards & Technology, Washington, DC 20234.</p>
