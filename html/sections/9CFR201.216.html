                            <p class="depth0">The Secretary may consider various criteria in determining whether a requirement that a poultry grower or swine production contract grower make additional capital investments over the life of a production contract or growing arrangement constitutes a violation of the Act. These criteria include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whether a packer, swine contractor or live poultry dealer failed to give a poultry grower or swine production contract grower discretion to decide against the additional capital investment requirement;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whether the additional capital investment is the result of coercion, retaliation or threats of coercion or retaliation by the packer, swine contractor or live poultry dealer;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whether the packer, swine contractor or live poultry dealer intends or does substantially reduce or end operations at the slaughter plant or processing facility or intends or does substantially reduce or end production operations within 12 months of requiring the additional capital investment, absent the occurrence of a catastrophic or natural disaster, or other emergency, such as unforeseen bankruptcy;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whether the packer, swine contractor, or live poultry dealer required some poultry growers or swine production contract growers to make additional capital investments, but did not require other similarly situated poultry growers or swine production contract growers to make the same additional capital investments;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The age and number of recent upgrades to, or capital investments in, the poultry grower's or swine production contract grower's operations;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Whether the cost of the required additional capital investments can reasonably be expected to be recouped by the poultry grower or swine production contract grower;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Whether a reasonable time period to implement the required additional capital investments is provided to the poultry grower or swine production contract grower; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Whether equipment changes are required with respect to equipment previously approved and accepted by the packer, swine contractor, or live poultry dealer, if existing equipment is functioning as it was intended to function unless the packer, swine contractor, or live poultry dealer provides adequate compensation incentives to the poultry grower or swine production contract grower.
