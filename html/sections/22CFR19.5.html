                                Sec. 19.5  Required notifications to Department respecting spouses


Sec. 19.5-1  Notification from participant or annuitant.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If a participant or former participant becomes divorced on or after February 15, 1981, he/she shall notify the Department (PER/ER/RET) of the divorce on or prior to its effective date. The notice shall include the effective date of the divorce, the full name, mailing address, and date of birth of the former spouse and the date of the member's marriage to that person, and enclose a certified copy of the divorce decree. If there is a court order or spousal agreement concerning payment or nonpayment of Foreign Service benefits to the former spouse, the original or a certified copy of the order or agreement shall also be forwarded to PER/ER/RET. In the absence of a court order or spousal agreement providing otherwise, the Department will pay a pro rata share of the member's benefits to the former spouse. (A former spouse of a former participant who separated from the Service on or before February 15, 1981 is not eligible for a pension under Sec. 19.9, i.e., not eligible for a pro rata share of the principal's annuity.) Upon receipt of notice of a divorce, a court order, or spousal agreement, the Department will proceed as indicated in Sec. 19.6 or Sec. 19.7. Delinquent notice to the Department of the divorce of an annuitant will result in retroactive payments to any qualified former spouse

to the extent that the retroactive payments can be deducted from future annuity payments to the principal as stated in Sec. 19.6-4.


Sec. 19.5-2  Notification to Department from former spouses.</p><p class="depth0">A former spouse is obligated to notify the Department of the following on a timely basis:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A divorce from a participant or former participant when the former spouse is notified by the court of the divorce before the participant is notified;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any change in address; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Any remarriage.
Notices shall be sent to the Department of State, Attention PER/ER/RET, Washington, DC 20520.


Sec. 19.5-3  Residence of spouse during service at unhealthful post.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The calculation of the pro rata share of benefits for a former spouse, and the determination of whether a person qualifies as a ``former spouse'' depends on the length of the marriage. The latter, under the definition in the Act and when the principal has received extra service credit for an assignment to an unhealthful post, depends upon whether a spouse has resided with the principal at the unhealthful post. In order to determine residency for this purpose, whenever a married participant is assigned to an unhealthful post for which he/she does not receive post differential and does receive or request extra service credit, the participant shall report on Form OF-140, Election to Receive Extra Service Credit Towards Retirement, whether his/her spouse is or is not residing at the post. Although a chief of mission is not required to submit Form OF-140 in order to receive extra credit for service at an unhealthful post, he/she must nevertheless submit this form if the chief of mission has a spouse that does not accompany him/her at post for the entire assignment. Both the participant and spouse shall sign the completed form. If there is a change in residence of the spouse during the assignment, a new joint Form OF-140 shall be filed to report the change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Whenever a participant retires or becomes divorced, or whenever a former participant becomes divorced who has extra service credit for assignment at unhealthful posts completed prior to the issuance of this regulation who was married during at least a portion of the assignment, the participant or former participant shall submit a statement to PER/ER/RET reporting on whether his/her spouse resided at the unhealthful post and the dates of such residence. The statement shall be signed by the principal and his/her spouse or former spouse whenever possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In the event of a disagreement between a principal and his/her spouse or former spouse concerning residency at an unhealthful post, or the submission of a report or statement by a principal showing a period of nonresidence at a post by a spouse which is not signed by the spouse, the determination of residence will be made by PER/ER/RET and based on records in the Department of payments for travel and allowances plus any other evidence that can be adduced. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the assumption will be made that the spouse resided at the post.</p>
