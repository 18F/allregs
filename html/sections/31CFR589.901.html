(NEA), section 212(f)  of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and  section 301 of title 3, United States Code,</p><p class="depth0">I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find  that the actions and policies of persons including persons who have  asserted governmental authority in the Crimean region without the  authorization of the Government of Ukraine that undermine democratic  processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security,  stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the  misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary  threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States,  and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. I  hereby order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> All property and interests in property that are in  the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that  are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United  States person (including any foreign branch) of the following persons  are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or  otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the  Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To be responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in,  directly or indirectly, any of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or  institutions in Ukraine;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> actions or policies that threaten the peace, security,  stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> misappropriation of state assets of Ukraine or of an  economically significant entity in Ukraine;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> to have asserted governmental authority over any part or region  of Ukraine without the authorization of the Government of Ukraine;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> to be a leader of an entity that has, or whose members have,  engaged in any activity described in subsection (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of  this section or of an entity whose property and interests in property  are blocked pursuant to this order;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial,  material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in  support of, any activity described in subsection (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of  this section or any person whose property and interests in property are  blocked pursuant to this order; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to  act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose  property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except  to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders,  directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and  notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit  granted prior to the effective date of this order.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 2. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and  nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet  one or more of the criteria in subsection 1(a) of this order would be  detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend  entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such  persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1  of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens  Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International  Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 3.

The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are  not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or  services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and  interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or  services from any such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose  of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate  any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set  forth in this order is prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 6.

For those persons whose property and interests in property  are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional  presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to  transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such  persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render  those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these  measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared  in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or  determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the  Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including  the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers  granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the  purposes of this order.
