The concern shall not submit an offer as a HUBZone small  business concern, until SBA issues a decision that the ineligibility is  resolved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the contracting officer has made a written determination in  accordance with (h)(1)(ii) or (h)(3) of this   section, awarded the contract, SBA has sustained the protest and  determined that the concern is not a HUBZone small business, and a  timely AA/GCBD appeal has been filed, then the contracting officer shall  consider whether performance can be suspended until an AA/GCBD decision  is rendered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If AA/GCBD affirms the decision of the HUBZone Program Director,  finding the protested concern is ineligible, and contract award has  occurred--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer shall terminate the contract, unless the  contracting officer has made a written determination that termination is  not in the best interest of the Government.

The protested HUBZone  small business concern, the protester, or the contracting officer may  file appeals of protest determinations with SBA's AA/GC&BD.; The AA/GC&BD;  must receive the appeal no later than 5 business days after the date of  receipt of the protest determination. SBA will dismiss any untimely  appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The appeal must be in writing. The appeal must identify the  protest determination being appealed and must set forth a full and  specific statement as to why the decision is erroneous or what  significant fact the HUBZone Program Director failed to consider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The party appealing the decision must provide notice of the  appeal to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> HUBZone Program Director, U.S. Small Business Administration,  409 Third Street SW., Washington, DC 20416 or by fax to 202-205-7167;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The protested HUBZone small business concern or the original  protester, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SBA will not consider additional information or changed  circumstances that were not disclosed at the time of the Director/HUB's  decision or that are based on disagreement with the findings and  conclusions contained in the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The AA/GCBD will make its decision within 5 business days of the  receipt of the appeal, if practicable, and will base its decision only  on the information and documentation in the protest record as  supplemented by the appeal. SBA will provide a copy of the decision to  the contracting officer, the protester, and the protested HUBZone small  business concern. The SBA decision, if received before award, will apply  to the pending acquisition. The AA/GCBD's decision is the final  decision.
