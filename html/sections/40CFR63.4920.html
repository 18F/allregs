                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Semiannual compliance reports. You must submit semiannual compliance reports for each affected source according to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section. The semiannual compliance reporting requirements may be satisfied by reports required under other parts of the Clean Air Act (CAA), such as those detailed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dates. Unless the Administrator has approved a different schedule for submission of reports under Sec. 63.10(a), you must prepare and submit each semiannual compliance report according to the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The first semiannual compliance report must cover the first semiannual reporting period which begins the day after the end of the initial compliance period described in Sec. 63.4940, Sec. 63.4950, or Sec. 63.4960 that applies to your affected source and ends on June 30 or December 31, whichever occurs first following the end of the initial compliance period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each subsequent semiannual compliance report must cover the subsequent semiannual reporting period from January 1 through June 30 or the semiannual reporting period from July 1 through December 31.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each semiannual compliance report must be postmarked or delivered no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date is the first date following the end of the semiannual reporting period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For each affected source that is subject to permitting regulations pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, and if the permitting authority has

established dates for submitting 6-month monitoring reports pursuant to 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), you may submit the first and subsequent semiannual compliance reports according to the dates the permitting authority has established for the 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 6-month monitoring reports instead of according to the dates specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section. However, under no circumstances shall the semiannual compliance report be submitted more than 30 days after the end of the semiannual reporting period established in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inclusion with title V report. Each affected source that has obtained a title V operating permit pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 must report all deviations as defined in this subpart in the 6-month monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). If an affected source submits a semiannual compliance report pursuant to this section along with, or as part of, the 6-month monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), and the semiannual compliance report includes all information required by the part 70 or part 71 6-month monitoring report concerning deviations from the requirements of this subpart as defined in Sec. 63.4981, the submission of the semiannual compliance report shall be deemed to satisfy any obligation to report the same deviation information in the part 70 or part 71 6-month monitoring report. However, in such situations, the 6-month monitoring report must cross-reference the semiannual compliance report, and submission of a semiannual compliance report shall not otherwise affect any obligation the affected source may have to report deviations from permit requirements to the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> General requirements. The semiannual compliance report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (v) of this section, and the information specified in paragraphs (a)(4) through (7) and (c)(1) of this section that is applicable to your affected source.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Company name and address.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Statement by a responsible official with that official's name, title, and signature, certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the report.
