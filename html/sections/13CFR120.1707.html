                                Sec. 120.1707  Seller's retained Loan Interest.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Seller must retain a 15% or greater Loan Interest in each of its  loans included in a Pool. At Pool formation, the CSA will issue the  Seller a Seller Receipt evidencing the Seller's retained ownership in  the Pool Loan. With SBA's written permission, the Seller may sell the  Seller Receipt and Servicing Retention Amount in whole, but not in part,  to a single entity at one time. The Seller may not sell less than 100%  of the Seller Receipt and Servicing Retention Amount, and may not sell a  participation interest in any portion of any of its Pooled loans. In  addition, in order to complete such sale, Seller must have the purchaser  of its rights to the Pool Loan execute the First Lien Position 504 Loan  Pool Guarantee Agreement as Seller and deliver the executed original to  the CSA.</p>
