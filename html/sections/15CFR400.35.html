To develop that memorandum, the examiner shall review the case records including public comments, and may request information and evidence from parties of record, as necessary.

The applicant shall be given 30 days from the date of notification, subject to extensions upon request by the applicant, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, in which to respond to the recommendation and submit additional evidence pertinent to the factors considered in the development of the preliminary recommendations. Public comment may be invited on preliminary recommendations when warranted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the response contains new evidence on which there has not been an opportunity for public comment, the Executive Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register after completion of the review of the response. The new material shall be made available for public inspection and the Federal Register notice shall invite further public comment for a period of not less than 30 days, with an additional 15-day period for rebuttal comments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the bases for an examiner's recommendation(s) change as a result of new evidence, the applicable procedures of Sec.
