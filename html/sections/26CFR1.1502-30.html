                                Sec. 1.1502-30  Stock basis after certain triangular reorganizations.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section provides rules for determining the basis of  the stock of an acquiring corporation as a result of a triangular  reorganization. The definitions and nomenclature contained in  Sec. 1.358-6 apply to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General rules--(1) Forward triangular merger, triangular C  reorganization, or triangular B reorganization. P adjusts its basis in  the stock of S as a result of a forward triangular merger, triangular C  reorganization, or triangular B reorganization under Sec. 1.358-6(c) and  (d), except that Sec. 1.358-6 (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(ii)</em> and (d)(2) do not apply.  Instead, P adjusts such basis by taking into account the full amount  of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> T liabilities assumed by S or the amount of liabilities to which  the T assets acquired by S are subject, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The fair market value of any consideration not provided by P  pursuant to the plan of reorganization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> do not apply.  Instead, P adjusts such basis by taking into account the full amount  of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> T liabilities deemed assumed by S or the amount of liabilities  to which the T assets deemed acquired by S are subject, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The fair market value of any consideration not provided by P  pursuant to the plan of reorganization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Excess loss accounts. Negative adjustments under this section  may exceed P's basis in its S or T stock. The resulting negative amount  is P's excess loss account in its S or T stock. See Sec. 1.1502-19 for  rules treating excess loss accounts as negative basis, and treating  references to stock basis as including references to excess loss  accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Application of other rules of law. If a transaction otherwise  subject to this section is also a group structure change subject to  Sec. 1.1502-31, the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-31 and not this section  apply to determine stock basis. See Sec. 1.1502-80(a) regarding the  general applicability of other rules of law and a limitation on  duplicative adjustments. See Sec. 1.1502-80(d) for the non-application  of section 357(c) to P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the  following examples. For purposes of these examples, P, S, and T are  domestic corporations, P and S file consolidated returns, P owns all of  the only class of S stock, the P stock exchanged in the transaction  satisfies the requirements of the applicable triangular reorganization  provisions, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, and tax  liabilities are disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(2)(D)</em> apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Basis adjustment. Under Sec. 1.358-6, P adjusts its $5 basis in  the S stock as if P had acquired the T assets with a carryover basis  under section 362 and transferred these assets to S in a transaction in  which P determines its basis in the S stock under section 358. Under the  rules of this section, the limitation described in Sec. 1.358- 6(c)(1)(ii) does not apply. Thus, P adjusts its basis in the S stock by  -$10 (the aggregate adjusted basis of T's assets decreased by the amount  of liabilities to which the T assets are subject). Consequently, as a  result of the reorganization, P has an excess loss account of $5 in its  S stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(2)(D)</em> apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Basis adjustment. Under Sec. 1.358-6, P adjusts its $5 basis in  the S stock as if P had acquired the T assets with a carryover basis  under section 362 and transferred these assets to S in a transaction in  which P determines its basis in the S stock under section 358. Under the  rules of this section, the limitation described in Sec. 1.358-6(d)(2)  does not apply. Thus, P adjusts its basis in the S stock by -$20 (the  aggregate adjusted basis of T's assets decreased by the fair market  value of the consideration provided by S). As a result of the  reorganization, P has an excess loss account of $15 in its S stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c))</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(2)(E)</em> apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Basis adjustment. Under Sec. 1.358-6, P's basis in the T stock  acquired equals its $5 basis in its S stock immediately before the  transaction adjusted by the $60 basis in the T assets deemed  transferred, and the $70 of liabilities to which the T assets are  subject. Under the rules of this section, the limitation described in  Sec. 1.358-6(c)(1)(ii) does not apply. Consequently, P has an excess  loss account of $5 in its T stock as a result of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to  reorganizations occurring on or after December 21, 1995. However,  paragraph (b)(4) of this section applies to reorganizations occurring on  or after September 17, 2008.  [T.D. 8648, 60 FR 66082, Dec. 21, 1995, as amended by T.D. 9424, 73 FR  53949, Sept. 17, 2008]</p>
