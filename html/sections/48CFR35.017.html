                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section sets forth Federal policy regarding the  establishment, use, review, and termination of Federally Funded Research  and Development Centers (FFRDC's) and related sponsoring agreements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An FFRDC meets some special long-term research or development  need which cannot be met as effectively by existing in-house or  contractor resources. FFRDC's enable agencies to use private sector  resources to accomplish tasks that are integral to the mission and  operation of the sponsoring agency. An FFRDC, in order to discharge its  responsibilities to the sponsoring agency, has access, beyond that which  is common to the normal contractual relationship, to Government and  supplier data, including sensitive and proprietary data, and to  employees and installations equipment and real property. The FFRDC is  required to conduct its business in a manner befitting its special  relationship with the Government, to operate in the public interest with  objectivity and independence, to be free from organizational conflicts  of interest, and to have full disclosure of its affairs to the  sponsoring agency. It is not the Government's intent that an FFRDC use  its privileged information or access to installations equipment and real  property to compete with the private sector. However, an FFRDC may  perform work for other than the sponsoring agency under the Economy Act,  or other applicable legislation, when the work is not otherwise  available from the private sector.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FFRDC's are operated, managed, and/or administered by either a  university or consortium of universities, other not-for-profit or  nonprofit organization, or an industrial firm, as an autonomous  organization or as an identifiable separate operating unit of a parent  organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Long-term relationships between the Government and FFRDC's are  encouraged in order to provide the continuity that will attract high- quality personnel to the FFRDC. This relationship should be of a type to  encourage the FFRDC to maintain currency in its field(s) of expertise,  maintain its objectivity and independence, preserve its familiarity with  the needs of its sponsor(s), and provide a quick response capability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this section--</p><p class="depth2">Nonsponsor means any other organization, in or outside of the  Federal Government, which funds specific work to be performed by the  FFRDC and is not a party to the sponsoring agreement.</p><p class="depth2">Primary sponsor means the lead agency responsible for managing,  administering, or monitoring overall use of the FFRDC under a multiple  sponsorship agreement.</p><p class="depth2">Sponsor means the executive agency which manages, administers,  monitors, funds, and is responsible for the overall use of an FFRDC.  Multiple agency sponsorship is possible as long a one agency agrees to  act as the ``primary sponsor.'' In the event of multiple sponsors,  ``sponsor'' refers to the primary sponsor.
