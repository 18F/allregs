Issuance of such an order shall be  without regard to the findings required by subsections 201(a) or 202(b)  of the Act (21 U.S.C. 811(a) or 812(b)) and without regard to the  procedures prescribed by Sec. 1308.41 or subsections 201 (a) and (b) of  the Act (21 U.S.C. 811 (a) and (b)). An order controlling a substance  shall become effective 30 days from the date of publication in the  Federal Register, unless the Administrator finds that conditions of  public health or safety necessitate an earlier effective date, in which  event the Administrator shall specify in the order his findings as to  such conditions.
