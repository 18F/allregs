                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Submission. The designated representative of a combustion or  process source may submit an opt-in permit application and a monitoring  plan to the Administrator at any time for any combustion or process  source that is operating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Issuance or denial of opt-in permits. The permitting authority  shall issue or deny opt-in permits or revisions of opt-in permits in  accordance with the procedures in parts 70 and 71 of this chapter and  subparts F and G of part 72 of this chapter, except as provided in this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Supplemental information. Regardless of whether the opt-in  permit application is complete, the Administrator or the permitting  authority may request submission of any additional information that the  Administrator or the permitting authority determines to be necessary in  order to review the opt-in permit application or to issue an opt-in  permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interim review of monitoring plan. The Administrator will  determine, on an interim basis, the sufficiency of the monitoring plan,  accompanying the opt-in permit application. A monitoring plan is  sufficient, for purposes of interim review, if the plan appears to  contain information demonstrating that all SO2 emissions,  NOX emissions, CO2 emissions, and opacity of the  combustion or process source are monitored and reported in accordance  with part 75 of this chapter. This interim review of sufficiency shall  not be construed as the approval or disapproval of the combustion or  process source's monitoring system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Issuance of draft opt-in permit. After the Administrator  determines whether the combustion or process source's monitoring plan is  sufficient under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the permitting  authority shall serve the draft opt-in permit or the denial of a draft  permit or the draft opt-in permit revisions or the denial of draft opt- in permit revisions on the designated representative of the combustion  or process source submitting an opt-in permit application. A draft  permit or draft opt-in permit revision shall not be served or issued if  the monitoring plan is determined not to be sufficient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Confirmation by source of intention to opt-in. Within 21  calendar days from the date of service of the draft opt-in permit or the  denial of the draft opt-in permit, the designated representative of a  combustion or process source submitting an opt-in permit application  must submit to the Administrator, in writing, a confirmation or recision  of the source's intention to become an opt-in source under this part.  The Administrator shall treat the failure to make a timely submission as  a recision of the source's intention to become an opt-in source and as a  withdrawal of the opt-in permit application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Issuance of draft opt-in permit. If the designated  representative confirms the combustion or process source's intention to  opt in under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the permitting authority  will give notice of the draft opt-in permit or denial of the draft opt- in permit and an opportunity for public comment, as provided under  Sec. 72.65 of this chapter with regard to a draft permit or denial of a  draft permit if the Administrator is the permitting authority or as  provided in accordance with part 70 of this chapter with regard to a  draft permit or the denial of a draft permit if the State is the  permitting authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Permit decision deadlines. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Administrator is the  permitting authority, an opt-in permit will be issued   or denied within 12 months of receipt of a complete opt-in permit  application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the State is the permitting authority, an opt-in permit will  be issued or denied within 18 months of receipt of a complete opt-in  permit application or such lesser time approved for operating permits  under part 70 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Withdrawal of opt-in permit application. A combustion or process  source may withdraw its opt-in permit application at any time prior to  the issuance of the final opt-in permit. Once a combustion or process  source withdraws its application, in order to re-apply, it must submit a  new opt-in permit application in accordance with Sec. 74.16 for  combustion sources or Sec. 74.17 for process sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Entry into Acid Rain Program--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Effective date. The effective  date of the opt-in permit shall be the January 1, April 1, July 1, or  October 1 for a combustion or process source providing monthly data  under Sec. 74.20, or January 1 for a combustion or process source  providing annual data under Sec. 74.20, following the later of the  issuance of the opt-in permit by the permitting authority or the  completion of monitoring system certification, as provided in subpart F  of this part for combustion sources or subpart G of this part for  process sources. The combustion or process source shall become an opt-in  source and an affected unit as of the effective date of the opt-in  permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allowance allocation. After the opt-in permit becomes effective,  the Administrator will allocate allowances to the opt-in source as  provided in Sec. 74.40. If the effective date of the opt-in permit is  not January 1, allowances for the first year shall be pro-rated as  provided in Sec. 74.28.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expiration of opt-in permit. An opt-in permit that is issued  before the completion of monitoring system certification under subpart F  of this part for combustion sources or under subpart G of this part for  process sources shall expire 180 days after the permitting authority  serves the opt-in permit on the designated representative of the  combustion or process source governed by the opt-in permit, unless such  monitoring system certification is complete. The designated  representative may petition the Administrator to extend this time period  in which an opt-in permit expires and must explain in the petition why  such an extension should be granted. The designated representative of a  combustion source governed by an expired opt-in permit and that seeks to  become an opt-in source must submit a new opt-in permit application.
