Wax beans may be additionally designated  ``golden'' or ``yellow''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following shall be included as part of the name or in  conjunction with the name of the food:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A declaration of any flavoring that characterizes the product as  specified in Sec. 101.22 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A declaration of any spice, seasoning, or garnishing that  characterizes the product, e.g., ``with added spice'', or, in lieu of  the word ``spice'', the common name of the spice, e.g., ``seasoned with  green peppers''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The words ``vacuum pack'' or ``vacuum packed'' when the weight  of the liquid in the container, as determined by the method prescribed  in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is not more than 25 percent of  the net weight, and the container is closed under conditions creating a  high vacuum in the container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The name of the optional style of bean ingredient as set forth  in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section or, if a product consists of a  mixture of such styles, the words ``mixture of '' the blank to be filled  in with the names of the styles present, arranged in the order of  decreasing predominance, if any, by weight of such ingredients. If the  product consists of whole beans and the pods are packed parallel to the  sides of the container, the word ``whole'' may be preceded or followed  by the words ``vertical pack'', or if the pods are cut at both ends and  are of substantially equal lengths, the words ``asparagus style'' may be  used in lieu of the words ``vertical pack''. If the product consists of  short cuts or diagonal short cuts, a numerical expression indicating the  predominate length of cut in the finished food may be used in lieu of  the word ``short'', e.g., ``\1/2\ inch cut''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following may be included in the name of the food:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The word ``stringless'' where the beans are in fact stringless.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The name of the optional varietal type as specified in paragraph  (a)(2)(ii) of this section, or the specific varietal name, e.g., ``Blue  Lake Green Beans'', or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a term designating diameter is used, it shall be supported  by an exact graphic representation of the cross section of the bean pod  or by a statement of the maximum diameter in common or decimal fractions  of an inch and, optionally, by the millimeter equivalent stated  parenthetically. The diameter of a whole, cut, diagonal cut, or short  cut is determined by measuring the thickest portion of the pod at the  shorter diameter of the bean perpendicular to the longitudinal axis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Label declaration. Each of the ingredients used in the food  shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of  parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Quality. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When tested by the method prescribed in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of cut beans and diagonal cut beans under paragraphs  (a)(2)(iii) (c) and (d) of this section and mixtures of two or more  optional forms under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(g) of this section, not more  than 60 units per 340 g (12 oz) drained weight are less than 13 mm (0.50  in) long: Provided, That where the number of units per 340 g (12 oz)  drained weight exceeds 240, not more than 25 percent by count of the  total units are less than 13 mm (0.50 in) long.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In case there are present pods or pieces of pods 10.7 mm (\27/ 64\-inch) or more in diameter, there are not more than 12 strings per  340 gm (12 ounces) of drained weight which will support 227 gm (one-half  pound) for 5 seconds or longer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The deseeded pods contain not more than 0.15 percent by weight  of fibrous material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> There are not more than 10 percent by weight of blemished units  of which amount not more than one-half may be materially damaged by  insect or pathological injury. A unit is considered blemished when the  aggregate blemished area exceeds the area of a circle 3 mm (\1/8\ in) in  diameter. Materially damaged means that the unit is   damaged to the extent that the appearance or eating quality of the unit  is seriously affected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> There are not more than 8 unstemmed units per 340 g (12 oz)  drained weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The combined number of leaves, detached stems, and other  extraneous vegetable matter shall not average more than 3 pieces per 340  g (12 oz) drained beans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Canned beans shall be tested by the following method to  determine whether they meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this  section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determine the gross weight of the container. Open and distribute  the contents of the container over the meshes of a U.S. No. 8 circular  sieve with openings of 2.36 mm (0.0937 in), which has been previously  weighed. The diameter of the sieve is 20.3 cm (8 in) if the quantity of  contents of the container is less than 1.36 kg (3 lb) and 30.5 cm (12  in) if such quantity is 1.36 kg (3 lb) or more. The bottom of the sieve  is woven-wire cloth that complies with the specifications of such cloth  set forth in ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of  Official Analytical Chemists,'' 15th ed. (1990), vol. 2, p. xii, Table  1, ``Nominal Dimensions of Standard Test Sieves (USA Standard Series),''  under the heading ``Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes,'' which  is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1  CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481  North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be  examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For  information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741- 6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/ code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. Without shifting the  material on the sieve, incline the sieve 17 to 20 to facilitate  drainage. Two minutes after drainage begins, weigh the sieve and the  drained material. Record in grams (ounces) the weight so found, less the  weight of the sieve, as the drained weight. Dry and weigh the empty  container and subtract this weight from the gross weight to obtain the  net weight. Calculate the percent of drained liquid in the net weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pour the drained material from the sieve into a flat tray and  spread it in a layer of fairly uniform thickness. Count the total number  of units. For the purpose of this count, loose seeds, pieces of seed,  loose stems, and extraneous material are not to be included. Divide the  number of units by the drained weight recorded in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of  this section and multiply by 340 to obtain the number of units per 340 g  (12 oz) drained weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> (c), (d) or (f) of this section,  count and record the number of units which are less than 13 mm (0.50  in.) long. If the number of units per 340 g (12 oz.) is 240 or less,  divide the number of units which are less than 13 mm (0.50 in.) by the  drained weight recorded in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and  multiply by 340 to obtain the number of such units per 340 g (12 oz.)  drained weight. If the number of units per 340 g (12 oz.) exceeds 240,  divide the number of units less than 13 mm (0.50 in.) long by the total  number of units and multiply by 100 to determine the percentage by count  of the total units which are less than 13 mm (0.50 in.) long.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Divide the weight of blemished units by the drained weight  recorded in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and multiply by 100 to  obtain the percentage by weight of blemished units in the container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)(i)</em> of this section and multiply by 340 to  obtain the number of unstemmed units per 340 g (12 oz.) of drained  weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Remove from the tray the extraneous vegetable material, count,  record count, and return to tray.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Remove from the tray one or more representative samples of 99 to  113 g (3\1/2\ to 4 ounces) covering each sample as taken to prevent  evaporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> From each representative sample selected in paragraph (b)(2)(v)  of this   section, discard any loose seed and extraneous vegetable material and  detach and discard any attached stems. Except with optional style of  ingredient specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(b) of this section (pods  sliced lengthwise), trim off, as far as the end of the space formerly  occupied by the seed, any portion of pods from which the seed has become  separated. Remove and discard any portions of seed from the trimmings  and reserve the trimmings for paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section.  Weigh and record the weight of the trimmed pods. Deseed the trimmed pods  and reserve the deseeded pods for paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this  section. Remove strings from the pods during the deseeding operation.  Reserve these strings for testing as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)  of this section. In the case of pods sliced lengthwise, remove seed and  pieces of seed and reserve the deseeded pods for use as prescribed in  paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> If strings have been removed for testing, as prescribed in  paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, test them as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Fasten clamp, weighted to 250 g (8.8 oz.), to one end of the string,  grasp the other end with the fingers (a cloth may be used to aid in  holding the string), and lift gently. Count the string as tough if it  supports the 250 g (8.8 oz.) weight for at least 5 seconds. If the  string breaks before 5 seconds, test such parts into which it breaks as  are 13 mm (\1/2\ in.) or more in length; and if any such part of the  string supports the 250 g (8.8 oz.) weight for at least 5 seconds, count  the string as tough. Divide the number of tough strings by the weight of  the sample recorded in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section and multiply  by 340 to obtain the number of tough strings per 340 g (12 oz.) drained  weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Combine the deseeded pods with the trimmings reserved in  paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, and, if strings were tested as  prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section, add such strings  broken or unbroken. Weigh and record weight of combined material.  Transfer to the metal cup of a malted-milk stirrer and mash with a  pestle. Wash material adhering to the pestle back into cup with 200 cc  of boiling water. Bring mixture nearly to a boil, add 25 cc of 50  percent (by weight) sodium hydroxide solution and bring to a boil. (If  foaming is excessive, 1 cc of capryl alcohol may be added.) Boil for 5  minutes, then stir for 5 minutes with a malted-milk stirrer capable of a  no-load speed of at least 7,200 rpm. Use a rotor with two scalloped  buttons shaped as shown in exhibit 1 as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01JA93.377   Transfer the material from the cup to a previously weighed 30-mesh monel  metal screen having a diameter of about 9-10 cm (3\1/2\ to 4 in.) and  side walls about 2.5 cm (1 in.) high, and wash fiber on the screen with  a stream of water using a pressure not exceeding a head (vertical  distance between upper level of water and outlet of glass tube) of 152  cm (60 in.), delivered through a glass tube 7.6 cm (3 in.) long and 3 mm  (\1/8\ in.) inside diameter inserted into a rubber tube of 6 mm (\1/4\  in.) inside diameter. Wash the pulpy portion of the material through the  screen and continue washing until the remaining fibrous material,  moistened with phenolphthalein solution, does not show any red color  after standing 5 minutes. Again wash to remove phenolphthalein. Dry the  screen containing the fibrous material for 2 hours at 100 C, cool,  weigh, and deduct weight of screen. Divide the weight of fibrous  material by the weight of combined deseeded pods, trimmings, and strings  and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage of fibrous material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> If the drained weight recorded in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this  section was less than 340 g (12 oz.), open and examine separately for  extraneous material,   as directed in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, additional  containers until a total of not less than 340 g (12 oz.) of drained  material is obtained. To determine the number of pieces of extraneous  vegetable material per 340 g (12 oz.) of drained weight, total the  number of pieces of extraneous vegetable material found in all  containers opened, divide this sum by the sum of the drained weights in  these containers and multiply by 340.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determine compliance as specified in Sec. 155.3(b) except that a  lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for extraneous plant material  based on an average of all containers examined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the quality of the canned green beans or canned wax beans  falls below the standard of quality prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of  this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard  quality specified in Sec. 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and  form therein specified; but in lieu of the words prescribed for the  second line inside the rectangle the following words may be used, when  the quality of canned green beans or canned wax beans falls below the  standard in one only of the following respects:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ``Excessive number blemished units'', if they fail to meet the  requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> ``Excessive number unstemmed units'', if they fail to meet the  requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> ``Excessive foreign material'', if they fail to meet the  requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this section.
