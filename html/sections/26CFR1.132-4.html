                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A no- additional-cost service or a qualified employee discount provided to an  employee is only available with respect to property or services that are  offered for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the same line of  business in which the employee receiving the property or service  performs substantial services. Thus, an employee who does not perform  substantial services in a particular line of business of the employer  may not exclude from income under section 132 (a)(1) or (a)(2) the value  of services or employee discounts received on property or services in  that line of business. For rules that relax the line of business  requirement, see paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property and services sold to employees rather than customers.  Because the property or services must be offered for sale to customers  in the ordinary course of the same line of business in which the  employee performs substantial services, the line of business limitation  is not satisfied if the employer's products or services are   sold primarily to employees of the employer, rather than to customers.  Thus, for example, an employer in the banking line of business is not  considered in the variety store line of business if the employer  establishes an employee store that offers variety store items for sale  to the employer's employees. See Sec. 1.132-7 for rules relating to  employer-operated eating facilities, and see Sec. 1.132-1(e) for rules  relating to employer-operated on-premises athletic facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Performance of substantial services in more than one line of  business. An employee who performs services in more than one of the  employer's lines of business may only exclude no-additional-cost  services and qualified employee discounts in the lines of business in  which the employee performs substantial services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Performance of services that directly benefit more than one  line of business--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. An employee who performs substantial  services that directly benefit more than one line of business of an  employer is treated as performing substantial services in all such line  of business. For example, an employee who maintains accounting records  for an employer's three lines of business may receive qualified employee  discounts in all three lines of business. Similarly, if an employee of a  minor line of business of an employer that is significantly interrelated  with a major line of business of the employer performs substantial  services that directly benefit both the major and the minor lines of  business, the employee is treated as performing substantial services for  both the major and the minor lines of business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. The rules provided in this paragraph (a)(1)(iv) are  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that employees of units of an employer provide  repair or financing services, or sell by catalog, with respect to retail  merchandise sold by the employer. Such employees may be considered to  perform substantial services for the retail merchandise line of business  under paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that an employer operates a hospital and a laundry  service. Assume further that some of the gross receipts of the laundry  service line of business are from laundry services sold to customers  other than the hospital employer. Only the employees of the laundry  service who perform substantial services which directly benefit the  hospital line of business (through the provision of laundry services to  the hospital) will be treated as performing substantial services for the  hospital line of business. Other employees of the laundry service line  of business will not be treated as employees of the hospital line of  business.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that the  employer also operates a chain of dry cleaning stores. Employees who  perform substantial services which directly benefit the dry cleaning  stores but who do not perform substantial services that directly benefit  the hospital line of business will not be treated as performing  substantial services for the hospital line of business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An employer's line of business is  determined by reference to the Enterprise Standard Industrial  Classification Manual (ESIC Manual) prepared by the Statistical Policy  Division of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. An employer is  considered to have more than one line of business if the employer offers  for sale to customers property or services in more than one two-digit  code classification referred to in the ESIC Manual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. Examples of two-digit classifications are general  retail merchandise stores; hotels and other lodging places; auto repair,  services, and garages; and food stores.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Aggregation of two-digit classifications. If, pursuant to  paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an employer has more than one line of  business, such lines of business will be treated as a single line of  business where and to the extent that one or more of the following  aggregation rules apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If it is uncommon in the industry of the employer for any of the  separate lines of business of the employer to be operated without the  others, the separate lines of business are treated as one line of  business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, the delicatessen and the service counter  are treated as one line of business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the retail operations of an employer that are located on  the same premises are in separate lines of business but would be  considered to be within one line of business under paragraph (a)(2) of  this section if the merchandise offered for sale in such lines of  business were offered for sale at a department store, then the  operations are treated as one line of business. For example, assume that  on the same premises an employer sells both women's apparel and jewelry.  Because, if sold together at a department store, the operations would be  part of the same line of business, the operations are treated as one  line of business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Grandfather rule for certain retail stores--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  line of business limitation may be relaxed under the special grandfather  rule of this paragraph (b). Under this special grandfather rule, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On October 5, 1983, at least 85 percent of the employees of one  member of an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504 without regard  to subsections (b)(2) and (b)(4) thereof) (``first member'') were  entitled to receive employee discounts at retail department stores  operated by another member of the affiliated group (``second member''),  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> More than 50 percent of the previous year's sales of the  affiliated group are attributable to the operation of retail department  stores, then, for purposes of the exclusion from gross income of a  qualified employee discount, the first member is treated as engaged in  the same line of business as the second member (the opeator of the  retail department stores). Therefore, employees of the first member of  the affiliated group may exclude from income qualified employee  discounts received at the retail department stores operated by the  second member. However, employees of the second member of the affiliated  group may not under this paragraph (b)(1) exclude any discounts received  on property or services offered for sale to customers by the first  member of the affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxable year of affiliated group. If not all of the members of  an affiliated group have the same taxable year, the affiliated group  must designate the 12-month period to be used in determining the  ``previous year's sales'' (as referred to in the grandfather rule of  this paragraph (b)). The 12-month period designated, however, must be  used on a consistent basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definition of ``sales.'' For purposes of this paragraph (b), the  term ``sales'' means the gross receipts of an affiliated group, based  upon the accounting methods used by its members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Retired and disabled employees. For purposes of this paragraph  (b), an employee includes any individual who was, or whose spouse was,  formerly employed by the first member of an affiliated group and who  separated from service with the member by reason of retirement or  disability if the second member of the group provided employee discounts  to that individual on October 5, 1983.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Increase of employee discount. If, after October 5, 1983, the  employee discount described in this paragraph (b) is increased, the  grandfather rule of this paragraph (b) does not apply to the amount of  the increase. For example, if on January 1, 1989, the employee discount  is increased from 10 percent to 15 percent, the grandfather rule will  not apply to the additional 5 percent discount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> only applies to services provided to such employees as of  January 1, 1984. For a special no-additional-cost service rule relating  to such employees and such services, see Sec. 1.132-2(a)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special rule for certain affiliates of commercial airlines--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  General rule. If a qualified affiliate is a member of an airline  affiliated group and employees of the qualified affiliate who are  directly engaged in providing airline-related services are entitled to  no-additional-cost service with respect to air transportation provided  by such other member, then, for purposes of applying Sec. 1.132-2  (relating to no-additional-cost services with respect to such air  transportation), such qualified affiliate shall be treated as engaged in  the same line of business as such other member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ``Airline affiliated group'' defined. An ``airline affiliated  group'' is an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504 (a)) one of  whose members operates a commercial airline that provides air  transportation to customers on a per-seat basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ``Qualified affiliate'' defined. A ``qualified affiliate'' is  any corporation that is predominantly engaged in providing airline- related services. The term ``airline-related services'' means any of the  following services provided in connection with air transportation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Catering,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Baggage handling,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ticketing and reservations,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Flight planning and weather analysis, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Restaurants and gift shops located at an airport.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em>. Under this special grandfather rule, if, as  of September 12, 1984--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An individual--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Was an employee (within the meaning of Sec. 1.132-1 (b)) of one  member of an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a)) (``first  corporation''), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Was eligible for no-additional-cost services in the form of air  transportation provided by another member of such affiliated group  (``second corporation''),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At least 50 percent of the individuals performing services for  the first corporation were, or had been employees of, or had previously  performed services for, the second corporation, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The primary business of the affiliated group was air  transportation of passengers, then, for purposes of applying sections  132(a) (1) and (2), with respect to no-additional-cost services and  qualified employee discounts provided after December 31, 1984, for that  individual by the second corporation, the first corporation is treated  as engaged in the same air transporation line of business as the second  corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an employee of the  second corporation who is performing services for the first corporation  is also treated as an employee of the first corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Special rule for qualified air transportation organizations. A  qualified air transportation organization is treated as engaged in the  line of business of providing air transportation with respect to any  individual who performs services for the organization if those services  are peformed primarily for persons engaged in providing air  transportation, and are of a kind which (if performed on September 12,  1984) would qualify the individual for no-additional-cost services in  the form of air transportation. The term ``qualified air transportation  organization'' means any organization--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If such organization (or a predecessor) was in existence on  September 12, 1984,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If such organization is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A tax-exempt organization under section(c)(6) whose membership  is limited to entities engaged in the transportation by air of  individuals or property for compensation or hire, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is a corporation all the stock of which is owned entirely by  entities described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If such organization is operated in furtherance of the  activities of its members or owners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Relaxation of line of business requirement. The line of business  requirement may be relaxed under an elective grandfather rule provided  in section 4977. For rules relating to the section 4977 election, see  Sec. 54.4977-1T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Line of business requirement does not expand benefits eligible  for exclusion. The line of business requirement limits the benefits  eligible for the no-additional-cost service and qualified employee  discount exclusions to property or services provided by an employer to  its customers in the ordinary course of the line of business of the  employer in which the employee performs substantial services. The  requirement is intended to ensure that employers do not offer, on a tax- free or reduced basis, property or services to employees that are not  offered to the employer's customers, even if the property or services  offered to the customers and the employees are within the same line of  business (as defined in this section).  [T.D. 8256, 54 FR 28606, July 6, 1989]    Sec. 1.132-4T  Line of business limitation--1985 through 1988  (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A no- additional-cost service or qualified employee discount provided to an  employee must be for property or services that are offered for sale to  customers in the ordinary course of the same line of business in which  the employee receiving the property or service performs substantial  services. Thus, an employee who does not perform substantial services in  a particular line of business of the employer may not exclude the value  of services or employee discounts received on property or services in  that line of business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property and services sold to employees rather than customers.  Since the property or services must be offered for sale to customers in  the ordinary course of the same line of business in which the employee  performs substantial services, the line of business limitation is not  satisfied if the employer's products or services are sold to employees  of the employer, rather than to customers. Thus, for example, an  employer in the banking line of business is not considered in the  variety store line of business if the employer establishes an employee  store that offers variety store items for sale to the employer's  employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Performance of substantial services in more than one line of  business. An employee who performs services in more than one of the  employer's lines of business may only exclude no-additional-cost  services and qualified employee discounts in the lines of business in  which the employee performs substantial services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Performance of services that directly benefit more than one  line of business--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. An employee who performs substantial  services that directly benefit more than one line of business of an  employer is treated as performing substantial services in all such lines  of business. For example, an employee who maintains accounting records  for an employer's three lines of business may receive qualified employee  discounts in all three lines of business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Significantly interrelated minor line of business. The employees  of a minor line of business of an employer that is significantly  interrelated with a major line of business of the employer who perform  substantial services that directly benefit both the major and the minor  lines of business are treated as employees of both the major and the  minor lines of business. Employees of the minor line of business who do  not perform substantial services which directly benefit the major line  of business are not treated as employees of the major line of business.  A minor line of business is significantly interrelated with a major line  of business when, for example, the activity of the minor line of  business is directly related to but is a minor part of the major line of  business (such as laundry services provided at a hospital).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples. The rules provided in this paragraph are illustrated  in the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that employees of units of an employer provide  repair or financing services, or sell by catalog, with respect to retail  merchandise sold by the employer. Such employees may be considered as  employees of the retail merchandise line of business under this  paragraph (a)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that an employer operates a hospital and a laundry  service. Assume further that some of the gross receipts of the laundry  service line of business are from laundry services sold to customers  other than the hospital employer. Only the employees of the laundry  service who perform substantial services which directly benefit the  hospital line of business (through the provision of laundry services to  the hospital) will be treated as employees of the hospital line of  business. Other employees of the laundry service line of business will  not be treated as employees of the hospital line of business.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that the  minor line of business also operates a chain of dry cleaning stores.  Employees who perform substantial services which directly benefit the  dry cleaning stores but who do not perform substantial services that  directly benefit the hospital line of business will not be treated as  employees of the hospital line of business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An employer's line of business is  determined by reference to the Enterprise Standard Industrial  Classification Manual (ESIC Manual) prepared by the Statistical Policy  Division of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. An employer is  considered to have more than one line of business if the employer offers  for sale to customers property or services in more than one two-digit  code classification referred to in the ESIC Manual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. Examples of two-digit classifications are general  retail merchandise stores; hotels and other lodging places; auto repair,  services, and garages; and food stores.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Aggregation of two-digit classifications. If, pursuant to  paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an employer has more than one line of  business, such lines of business will be treated as a single line of  business where and to the extent that one or more of the following  aggregation rules apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If it is uncommon in the industry of the employer for any of the  separate lines of business of the employer to be operated without the  others, the separate lines of business are treated as one line of  business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If it is common for a substantial number of employees (other  than those employees who work at the headquarters or main office of the  employer) to perform substantial services for more than one line of  business of the employer, so that determination of which employees  perform substantial services for which line of business would be  difficult, then the separate lines of business of the employer in which  such employees perform substantial services are treated as one line of  business. For example, assume that an employer operates a delicatessen  with an attached service counter at which food is sold for consumption  on the premises. Assume further that most but not all employees work  both at the delicatessen and at the service counter. The delicatessen  and the service counter are treated as one line of business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the retail operations of an employer that are located on  the same premises are in separate lines of business but would be  considered to be within one line of business under paragraph (a)(2) of  this section if the merchandise offered for sale in such lines of  business were offered for sale at a department store, then the  operations are treated as one line of business. For example, assume that  on the same premises an employer sells both women's apparel and jewelry.  Since, if sold together at a department store, the operations would be  part of the same line of business, the operations are treated as one  line of business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Grandfather rule for certain retail stores--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  line of business limitation may be relaxed under a special grandfather  rule. If--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On October 5, 1983, 85 percent of the employees of one member of  an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504 without regard to  subsections (b)(2) and (b)(4) thereof) were entitled to employee  discounts at retail department stores operated by another member of the  affiliated group, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> More than 50 percent of the current year's sales of the  affiliated group are attributable to the operation of retail department  stores,  then for purposes of the exclusion from gross income of a qualified  employee discount, the first member is treated as engaged in the same  line of business as the second member (the operator of the retail  department stores). Therefore, employees of the first member of the  affiliated group may exclude qualified   employee discounts received at the retail department stores operated by  the second member. However, employees of the second member of the  affiliated group may not exclude any discounts received on property or  services offered for sale to customers by the first member of the  affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxable year of affiliated group. If all of the members do not  have the same taxable year, the affiliated group must designate the 12- month period to be used in determining the ``current year's sales'' (as  referred to in this paragraph (b)). The 12-month period designated,  however, must be used consistently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definition of ``sales''. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the  term ``sales'' means the gross receipts of the affiliated group, based  upon the accounting methods used by its members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Retired and disabled employees.
