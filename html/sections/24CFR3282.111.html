                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. A petition for reconsideration of a final rule  issued by the Secretary is a request in writing from any interested  person which must be received not later than 60 days after publication  of the rule in the Federal Register. The petition shall state that it is  a petition for reconsideration of a final rule, and shall contain an  explanation as to why compliance with the rule is not practicable, is  unreasonable, or is not in the public interest. If the petitioner  requests the consideration of additional facts, the petitioner shall  state the reason they were not presented to be treated as petitions for  rulemaking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Proceedings on petitions for reconsideration. The Secretary may  grant or deny, in whole or in part, any petition for reconsideration  without further proceedings. The Secretary may issue a final decision on  reconsideration without further proceeding, or may provide such  opportunity to submit comments or information and data as the Secretary  deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless the Secretary determines otherwise, the filing of a  petition under this section does not stay the effectiveness of the rule  in question.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any party seeking to challenge any rule or regulation issued  under the Act, except orders issued under section 604 42 U.S.C. 5403, if  the challenge is brought before the expiration of the 60 day period set  out in paragraph (a) of this section, shall file a timely petition for  reconsideration under this section prior to seeking any other remedy.</p>
