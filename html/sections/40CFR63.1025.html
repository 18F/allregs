Unless otherwise specified in Sec.  63.1021(b) or paragraph (e) of this section, or the referencing subpart, the owner or operator shall monitor all valves at the intervals specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and/or (b)(4) of this section and shall comply with all other provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Monitoring method. The valves shall be monitored to detect leaks by the method specified in Sec.  63.1023(b) and, as applicable, Sec.  63.1023(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Instrument reading that defines a leak. The instrument reading that defines a leak is 500 parts per million or greater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Monitoring frequency. The owner or operator shall monitor valves for leaks at the intervals specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(v) of this section and shall keep the record specified in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If at least the greater of 2 valves or 2 percent of the valves in a process unit leak, as calculated according to paragraph (c) of this section, the owner

or operator shall monitor each valve once per month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At process units with less than the greater of 2 leaking valves or 2 percent leaking valves, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve once each quarter, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) through (b)(3)(v) of this section. Monitoring data generated before the regulated source became subject to the referencing subpart and meeting the criteria of either Sec.  63.1023(b)(1) through (b)(5), or Sec.  63.1023(b)(6), may be used to qualify initially for less frequent monitoring under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) through (b)(3)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> At process units with less than 1 percent leaking valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every two quarters</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> At process units with less than 0.5 percent leaking valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every four quarters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> At process units with less than 0.25 percent leaking valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 2 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The owner or operator shall keep a record of the monitoring schedule for each process unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Valve subgrouping. For a process unit or a group of process units to which this subpart applies, an owner or operator may choose to subdivide the valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units and apply the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section to each subgroup. If the owner or operator elects to subdivide the valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units, then the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (b)(4)(viii) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units to be subdivided shall be less than 2 percent leaking valves, as detected according to paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section and as calculated according to paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The initial assignment or subsequent reassignment of valves to subgroups shall be governed by the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) through (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The owner or operator shall determine which valves are assigned to each subgroup. Valves with less than one year of monitoring data or valves not monitored within the last twelve months must be placed initially into the most frequently monitored subgroup until at least one year of monitoring data have been obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a less frequently monitored subgroup to a more frequently monitored subgroup provided that the valves to be reassigned were monitored during the most recent monitoring period for the less frequently monitored subgroup. The monitoring results must be included with that less frequently monitored subgroup's associated percent leaking valves calculation for that monitoring event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a more frequently monitored subgroup to a less frequently monitored subgroup provided that the valves to be reassigned have not leaked for the period of the less frequently monitored subgroup (e.g., for the last 12 months, if the valve or group of valves is to be reassigned to a subgroup being monitored annually). Nonrepairable valves may not be reassigned to a less frequently monitored subgroup.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The owner or operator shall determine every 6 months if the overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units is less than 2 percent leaking valves and so indicate the performance in the next Periodic Report. If the overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units is 2 percent leaking valves or greater, the owner or operator shall no longer subgroup and shall revert to the program required in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section for that applicable process unit or group of process units. An owner or operator can again elect to comply with the valve subgrouping procedures of paragraph (b)(4) of this section if future overall performance of total valves in the process unit or group of process units is again less than 2 percent. The overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units shall be calculated as a

weighted average of the percent leaking valves of each subgroup according to Equation number 1:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN99.010
