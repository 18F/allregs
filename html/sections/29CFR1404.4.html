                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Roster. FMCS shall maintain a Roster of labor arbitrators consisting of persons who meet the criteria for listing contained in Sec. 1404.5 and who remain in good standing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adherence of Standards and Requirements. Persons listed on the Roster shall comply with FMCS rules and regulations pertaining to arbitration and with such guidelines and procedures as may be issued by the OAS pursuant to subpart C of this Part. Arbitrators shall conform to the ethical standards and procedures set forth in the Code of Professional Responsibility for Arbitrators of Labor Management Disputes, as approved by the National Academy of Arbitrators, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and the American Arbitration Association (Code).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Status of arbitrators. Persons who are listed on the Roster and are selected or appointed to hear arbitration matters or to serve as factfinders do not become employees of the Federal Government by virtue of their selection or appointment. Following selection or appointment, the arbitrator's relationship is solely with the parties to the dispute, except that arbitrators are subject to certain reporting requirements and to standards of conduct as set forth in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Role of FMCS. FMCS has no power to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compel parties to appear before an arbitrator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Enforce an agreement to arbitrate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compel parties to arbitrate any issue;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Influence, alter, or set aside decisions of arbitrators on the Roster;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Compel, deny, or modify payment of compensation to an arbitrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Nominations and Panels. On request of the parties to an agreement to arbitrate or engage in fact-finding, or where arbitration or fact-finding may be provided for by statute, OAS will provide names or panels of names for a fee. Procedures for obtaining these services are outlined in subpart C of this part. Neither the submission of a nomination or panel nor the appointment of an arbitrator constitutes a determination by FMCS that an agreement to arbitrate or enter fact-finding proceedings exists; nor does such action constitute a ruling that the matter in controversy is arbitrable under any agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Rights of persons listed on the Roster. No person shall have any right to be listed or to remain listed on the Roster. FMCS retains its authority and responsibility to assure that the needs of the parties using its services are served. To accomplish this purpose, FMCS may establish procedures for the preparation of panels or the appointment of arbitrators or factfinders which include consideration of such factors as background and experience, availability, acceptability, geographical location, and the expressed preferences of the parties. FMCS may also establish procedures for the removal from the Roster of those arbitrators who fail to adhere to provisions contained in this part.
