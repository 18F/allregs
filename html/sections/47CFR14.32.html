Any Requests filed using a method other than the Commission's online system should include a cover letter that references section 255, 716, or 718 or the rules of parts 6, 7, or 14 of this chapter and should be addressed to the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau. Any party with a question about information that should be included in a Request for Dispute Assistance should email the Commission's Disability Rights Office at dro@fcc.gov or call (202) 418-2517 (voice), (202) 418-2922 (TTY).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Request for Dispute Assistance shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, email address, and telephone number of the party making the Request (Requester);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name of the manufacturer or service provider that the requester believes is in violation of section 255, 716, or 718 or the rules in this part, and the name, address, and telephone number of the manufacturer or service provider, if known;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An explanation of why the requester believes the manufacturer or service provider is in violation of section 255, 716, or 718 or the rules in this part, including details regarding the service or equipment and the relief requested, and all documentation that supports the requester's contention;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The date or dates on which the requester either purchased, acquired, or used (or attempted to purchase, acquire, or use) the equipment or service in question;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Requester's preferred format or method of response to its Request for Dispute Assistance by CGB or the manufacturer or service provider (e.g., letter, facsimile transmission, telephone (voice/TRS/TTY), email, audio-cassette recording, Braille, or some other method that will best accommodate the Requester's disability, if any);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any other information that may be helpful to CGB and the manufacturer or service provider to understand the nature of the dispute;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Description of any contacts with the manufacturer or service provider to resolve the dispute, including, but not limited to, dates or approximate dates, any offers to settle, etc.; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> What the Requester is seeking to resolve the dispute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CGB shall forward the Request for Dispute Assistance to the manufacturer or service provider named in the Request. CGB shall serve the manufacturer or service provider using the contact details of the certification to be filed pursuant to Sec. 14.31(b). Service

using contact details provided pursuant to Sec. 14.31(b) is deemed served. Failure by a manufacturer or service provider to file or keep the contact information current will not be a defense of lack of service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> CGB will assist the Requester and the manufacturer or service provider in reaching a settlement of the dispute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Thirty days after the Request for Dispute Assistance was filed, if a settlement has not been reached between the Requester and the manufacturer or service provider, the Requester may file an informal complaint with the Commission;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When a Requester files an informal complaint with the Enforcement Bureau, as provided in Sec. 14.34, the Commission will deem the CGB dispute assistance process closed and the requester and manufacturer or service provider shall be barred from further use of the Commission's dispute assistance process so long as a complaint is pending.</p>
