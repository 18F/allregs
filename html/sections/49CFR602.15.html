If the FTA Administrator determines any requirement  is inapplicable, the determination shall apply to all eligible  activities undertaken with funds authorized under 49 U.S.C. 5324 within  the 45-day period, as well as funds authorized under 49 U.S.C. 5307 and  5311 and used for eligible emergency relief activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FTA shall publish a notice on its Web site and in the emergency  relief docket established under 49 CFR part 601 regarding the grant  requirements for a particular emergency or major disaster.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event an affected recipient or subrecipient believes an  FTA requirement limits its ability to respond to the emergency or major  disaster, the recipient or subrecipient may request that the requirement  be waived in accordance with the emergency relief docket process as  outlined in 49 CFR part 601, subpart D. Applicants should not proceed on  projects assuming that requests for such waivers will be granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In accordance with Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management,  recipients shall not use grant funds for any activity in an area  delineated as a special flood hazard area or equivalent, as labeled in  the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate  Maps (FIRMs).
