A determination that was conducted prior to the compliance date for this subpart may be utilized to comply with this subpart if it is still representative.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The owner or operator may prepare and implement a gas stream flow determination plan that documents an appropriate method which will be used to determine the gas stream flow. The plan shall require determination of gas stream flow by a method which will at least provide a value for either a representative or the highest gas stream

flow anticipated in the scrubber during representative operating conditions other than malfunctions. The plan shall include a description of the methodology to be followed and an explanation of how the selected methodology will reliably determine the gas stream flow, and a description of the records that will be maintained to document the determination of gas stream flow. The owner or operator shall maintain the plan as specified in Sec.  63.1335(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where an absorber is used, a scrubbing liquid temperature monitoring device and a specific gravity monitoring device are required, each equipped with a continuous recorder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where a condenser is used, a condenser exit temperature (product side) monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where a carbon adsorber is used, an integrating regeneration steam flow or nitrogen flow, or pressure monitoring device having an accuracy of \10 percent of the flow rate, level, or pressure, or better, capable of recording the total regeneration steam flow or nitrogen flow, or pressure (gauge or absolute) for each regeneration cycle; and a carbon bed temperature monitoring device, capable of recording the carbon bed temperature after each regeneration and within 15 minutes of completing any cooling cycle are required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> As an alternate to paragraphs (c)(5) through (c)(7) of this section, the owner or operator may install an organic monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alternative monitoring parameters. An owner or operator of a batch process vent or aggregate batch vent stream may request approval to monitor parameters other than those required by paragraph (c) of this section. The request shall be submitted according to the procedures specified in Sec.  63.1327(f) and Sec.  63.1335(f). Approval shall be requested if the owner or operator:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Uses a control device other than those included in paragraph (c) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Uses one of the control devices included in paragraph (c) of this section, but seeks to monitor a parameter other than those specified in Table 7 of this subpart and paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Monitoring of bypass lines.
