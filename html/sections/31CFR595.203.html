If interest is credited to an account separate from that in which the interest-bearing asset is held, the name of the account party on both accounts must be the same and must clearly indicate the specially designated terrorist having an interest in the accounts. If the account is held in the name of a specially designated terrorist, the name of the account to which interest is credited must be the same.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of this section, the term interest-bearing account means a blocked account in a U.S. financial institution earning interest at rates that are commercially reasonable for the amount of funds in the account. Except as otherwise authorized, the funds may not be invested or held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 180 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This section does not apply to blocked tangible property, such as chattels, nor does it create an affirmative obligation on the part of the holder of such blocked tangible property to sell or liquidate the property and put the proceeds in a blocked account. However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may issue licenses permitting or directing sales of tangible property in appropriate cases.
