No prior OCC approval is required. The written notice must include a complete description of the bank's investment in the bank service company and of the activity conducted and a representation and undertaking that the activity will be conducted in accordance with OCC guidance.

The bank must also list for each state the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the state where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable. Any bank receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the bank service company will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with the published OCC guidance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Investments requiring no approval. A national bank does not need OCC approval to invest in a bank service company, or to perform a new activity in an existing bank service company, if the bank service company will provide the following services only for depository institutions: check and deposit posting and sorting; computation and posting of interest and other credits and charges; preparation and mailing of checks, statements, notices, and similar items; or any other clerical, bookkeeping, accounting, statistical, or similar function.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Federal Reserve approval.

To the extent the notice relates to the initial affiliation of the bank with a company engaged in insurance activities, the bank should describe the type of insurance activity that the company is engaged in and has present plans to conduct. The bank must also list for each state the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the state where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information demonstrating that the bank will comply with the investment limitations of paragraph (i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Information demonstrating that the bank service company will perform only those services that each insured depository institution shareholder or member is authorized to perform under applicable Federal or State law and will perform such services only at locations in a State in which each such shareholder or member is authorized to perform such services unless performing services that are authorized by the Federal Reserve Board under the authority of 12 U.S.C. 1865(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Examination and supervision. Each bank service company in which a national bank is the principal investor is subject to examination and supervision by the OCC in the same manner and to the same extent as that national bank. OCC authority under this paragraph is subject to the limitations and requirements of section 45 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831v) and section 115 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1820a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Investment limitations. A bank may not invest more than ten percent of its capital and surplus in a bank service company.
