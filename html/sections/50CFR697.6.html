                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person who receives, for a commercial purpose (other than  solely for transport on land), American lobster from the owner or  operator of a vessel issued a valid permit under this part, or any  person who receives, for a commercial purpose (other than solely for  transport on land), American lobster, managed by this part, must have  been issued, and have in his/her possession, a valid permit issued under  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Dealer application. Applicants for a dealer permit under this  section must submit a completed permit application on an appropriate  form obtained from the Regional Administrator. To be complete, an  application must contain   at least the following information, and any other information specified  on the application form or otherwise required by the Regional  Administrator: Company name, place(s) of business, mailing address(es)  and telephone number(s); owner's name; dealer permit number (if a  renewal); and name and signature of the person responsible for the truth  and accuracy of the report. If the dealer is a corporation, a copy of  the Certificate of Incorporation; and the names and addresses of all  shareholders owning 25 percent or more of the corporation's shares, must  be included with the application. If the dealer is a partnership, a copy  of the Partnership Agreement and the names and addresses of all  partners; if there is more than one partner, names of all partners  having more than a 25 percent interest; and name and signature of all  partner or partners authorized must be included with the application.  The application must be signed by the applicant and submitted to the  Regional Administrator at least 30 days prior to the date on which the  applicant needs the permit. The Regional Administrator will notify the  applicant of any deficiency in the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fees. The Regional Administrator may charge a fee to recover the  administrative expenses of issuing a permit required under this section.  The amount of the fee shall be calculated in accordance with the  procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook, available from the Regional  Administrator, for determining administrative costs of each special  product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and shall be  specified with each application form. The applicable fee must accompany  each application; if it does not, the application will be considered  incomplete for purposes of paragraph (e) of this section. Any fee paid  by an insufficiently funded commercial instrument shall render any  permit issued on the basis thereof null and void.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Issuance. Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904,  the Regional Administrator will issue a permit at any time during the  fishing year to an applicant, unless the applicant has failed to submit  a completed application. An application is complete when all requested  forms, information, and documentation have been received. Upon receipt  of an incomplete or improperly executed application, the Regional  Administrator will notify the applicant of the deficiency in the  application. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 30  days following the date of notification, the application will be  considered abandoned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expiration. A permit expires upon the renewal date specified in  the permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Duration. A permit is valid until it is revoked, suspended, or  modified under 15 CFR part 904, or otherwise expires, or ownership  changes, or the applicant has failed to report any change in the  information on the permit application to the Regional Administrator as  required by paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reissuance. A dealer permit may be reissued by the Regional  Administrator when requested in writing by the applicant, stating the  need for reissuance and the number of the permit requested to be  reissued. An application for a reissued permit is not considered a new  application. An appropriate fee may be charged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Transfer. Permits issued under this section are not transferable  or assignable. A permit is valid only for the person, or other business  entity, to which it is issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Change in application information. Notice of a change in the  dealers name, address, or telephone number must be submitted in writing  to, and received by, the Regional Administrator within 15 days of the  change in information. If written notice of the change in information is  not received by the Regional Administrator within 15 days, the permit is  void.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Alteration. Any permit that has been altered, erased, or  mutilated is invalid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Display. Any permit issued under this part must be maintained in  legible condition and displayed for inspection upon request by any  authorized officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Federal versus state requirements.
