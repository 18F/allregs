In determining the adequacy of an operator's plans or procedures, the Associate Administrator may consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Relevant pipeline safety data;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the plans or procedures are appropriate for the particular type of pipeline transportation or facility, and for the location of the facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The reasonableness of the plans or procedures; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The extent to which the plans or procedures contribute to public safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An order directing amendment of an operator's plans or procedures prescribed in this section may be in addition to, or in conjunction with, other appropriate enforcement actions prescribed in this subpart.
