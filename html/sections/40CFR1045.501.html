                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This subpart is addressed to you as a  manufacturer but it applies equally to anyone who does testing for you,  and to us when we perform testing to determine if your engines meet  emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General requirements. Use the equipment and procedures for  spark-ignition engines in 40 CFR part 1065 to determine whether engines  meet the duty-cycle emission standards in Sec. Sec.  1045.103 and  1045.105. Measure the emissions of all exhaust constituents subject to  emissions standards as specified in 40 CFR part 1065. Measure  CO2, N2O, and CH4 as described in Sec.   1045.235. Use the applicable duty cycles specified in Sec.  1045.505.  Section 1045.515 describes the supplemental procedures for evaluating  whether engines meet the not-to-exceed emission standards in Sec.   1045.107.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fuels. Use the fuels and lubricants specified in 40 CFR part  1065, subpart H, for all the testing we require in this part, except as  specified in Sec.  1045.515. Use gasoline meeting the specifications  described in 40 CFR 1065.710 for general testing. For service  accumulation, use the test fuel or any commercially available fuel that  is representative of the fuel that in-use engines will use. You may  alternatively use gasoline blended with ethanol as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may use the ethanol-blended fuel for certifying engines  under this part without our advance approval. If you use the blended  fuel for certifying a given engine family, you may also use it for  production-line testing or any other testing you perform for that engine  family under this part. If you use the blended fuel for certifying a  given engine family, we may use the blended fuel or the specified  gasoline test fuel with that engine family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The blended fuel must consist of a mix of gasoline meeting the  specifications described in 40 CFR 1065.710 for general testing and  fuel-grade ethanol meeting the specifications described in 40 CFR  1060.501(c) such that the blended fuel has 10.0+1.0 percent ethanol by  volume. You may also use ethanol with a higher or lower purity if you  show us that it will not affect your ability to   demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission standards. You do  not need to measure the ethanol concentration of such blended fuels and  may instead calculate the blended composition by assuming that the  ethanol is pure and mixes perfectly with the base fuel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>. Emissions may not be corrected for the  effects of test temperature or pressure. Humidity levels must represent  actual in-use humidity levels; however, you may correct emissions for  humidity as specified in 40 CFR 1065.670.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Engine stabilization. Instead of the provisions of 40 CFR  1065.405, you may consider emission levels stable without measurement  after 12 hours of engine operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em>, you may declare a value of maximum test speed for  laboratory testing that is within 500 rpm of the corresponding measured  value for maximum test speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Special and alternate procedures. If you are unable to run the  duty cycle specified in this part for your engine (such as with  constant-speed engines), use an alternate test cycle that will result in  a cycle-weighted emission measurement equivalent to the expected average  in-use emissions. This cycle must be approved under 40 CFR 1065.10. You  may use other special or alternate procedures to the extent we allow  them under 40 CFR 1065.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Laboratory testing with portable analyzers. You may use field- grade equipment for any laboratory testing with high-performance  engines, as specified in 40 CFR 1065.901(b), without requesting  approval.  [73 FR 59194, Oct. 8, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 56510, Oct. 30, 2009]</p>
