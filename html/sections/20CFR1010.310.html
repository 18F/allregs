                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recipients of funds for qualified job training programs must  implement processes in accordance with Sec. 1010.300 to identify  covered persons at the point of entry, whether in person or virtual, so  the covered person can be notified of their eligibility for priority of  service. Since qualified job training programs may offer various types  of services including staff-assisted services as well as self-services  or informational activities, recipients also must ensure that priority  of service is implemented throughout the full array of services provided  to covered persons by the qualified job training program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Universal access programs operate or deliver services to the  public as a whole; they do not target specific groups. These programs  are required to provide priority of service to covered persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Discretionary targeting programs focus on a particular group, or  make efforts to provide a certain level of service to such a group, but  do not specifically mandate that the favored group be served before  other eligible individuals. Whether these provisions are found in a  Federal statute or regulation, priority of service will apply. Covered  persons must receive the highest priority for the program or service,  and non-covered persons within the discretionary targeting will receive  priority over non-covered persons outside the discretionary targeting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Statutory targeting programs are programs derived from a Federal  statutory mandate that requires a priority   or preference for a particular group of individuals or requires spending  a certain portion of program funds on a particular group of persons  receiving services. These are mandatory priorities. Recipients must  determine each individual's covered person status and apply priority of  service as described below:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Covered persons who meet the mandatory priorities or spending  requirement or limitation must receive the highest priority for the  program or service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Non-covered persons within the program's mandatory priority or  spending requirement or limitation, must receive priority for the  program or service over covered persons outside the program-specific  mandatory priority or spending requirement or limitation; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Covered persons outside the program-specific mandatory  priority or spending requirement or limitation must receive priority for  the program or service over non-covered persons outside the program- specific mandatory priority or spending requirement or limitation.</p>
