                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Interest. EPA will assess interest on all delinquent debts  unless prohibited by statute, regulation or contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date of the  initial notice to the debtor. EPA will not recover interest where the  debt is paid within 30 days of the date of the notice. EPA will assess  an annual rate of interest that is equal to the rate of the current  value of funds to the United States Treasury (i.e., the Treasury tax and  loan account rate) as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the  Treasury in the Federal Register and the Treasury Fiscal Requirements  Manual Bulletins, unless a different rate is necessary to protect the  interest of the Government. EPA will notify the debtor of the basis for  its finding that a different rate is necessary to protect the interest  of the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator may extend the 30-day period for payment where  he determines that such action is in the best interest of the  Government. A decision to extend or not to extend the payment period is  final and is not subject to further review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The rate of interest, as initially assessed, remains fixed for  the duration of the indebtedness. If a debtor defaults on a repayment  agreement, interest   may be set at the Treasury rate in effect on the date a new agreement is  executed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Interest will not be assessed on interest charges,  administrative costs or later payment penalties. However, where a debtor  defaults on a previous repayment agreement and interest, administrative  costs and penalties charges have been waived under the defaulted  agreement, these charges can be reinstated and added to the debt  principal under any new agreement and interest charged on the entire  amount of the debt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Administrative costs of collecting overdue debts. The costs of  the Agency's administrative handling of overdue debts, based on either  actual or average cost incurred, will be charged on all debts except  those owed by State and local governments and Indian tribes. These costs  include both direct and indirect costs. Administrative costs will be  assessed monthly throughout the period the debt is overdue except as  provided by Sec. 13.12.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Penalties. As provided by 31 U.S.C. 3717(e)(2), a penalty charge  will be assessed on all debts, except those owned by State and local  governments and Indian tribes, more than 90 days delinquent. The penalty  charge will be at a rate not to exceed 6% per annum and will be assessed  monthly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Allocation of payments. A partial payment by a debtor will be  applied first to outstanding administrative costs, second to penalty  assessments, third to accrued interest and then to the outstanding debt  principal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Waiver. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator may (without regard to the amount  of the debt) waive collection of all or part of accrued interest,  penalty or administrative costs, where he determines that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Waiver is justified under the criteria of Sec. 13.25;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The debt or the charges resulted from the Agency's error,  action or inaction, and without fault by the debtor; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Collection of these charges would be against equity and good  conscience or not in the best interest of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A decision to waive interest, penalty charges or administrative  costs may be made at any time prior to payment of a debt. However, where  these charges have been collected prior to the waiver decision, they  will not be refunded. The Administrator's decision to waive or not waive  collection of these charges is a final agency action.</p>
