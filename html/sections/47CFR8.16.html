                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any materials generated in the course of a proceeding under this part may be designated as proprietary by either party to the proceeding or a third party if the party believes in good faith that the materials fall within an exemption to disclosure contained in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (1) through (9). Any party asserting confidentiality for such materials must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clearly mark each page, or portion thereof, for which a proprietary designation is claimed. If a proprietary designation is challenged, the party claiming confidentiality shall have the

burden of demonstrating, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the materials designated as proprietary fall under the standards for nondisclosure enunciated in the FOIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> File with the Commission, using the Commission's Electronic Comment Filing System, a public version of the materials that redacts any proprietary information and clearly marks each page of the redacted public version with a header stating ``Public Version.'' The redacted document shall be machine-readable whenever technically possible. Where the document to be filed electronically contains metadata that is confidential or protected from disclosure by a legal privilege (including, for example, the attorney-client privilege), the filer may remove such metadata from the document before filing it electronically.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> File with the Secretary's Office an unredacted hard copy version of the materials that contain the proprietary information and clearly marks each page of the unredacted confidential version with a header stating ``Confidential Version.'' The unredacted version must be filed on the same day as the redacted version.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Serve one hard copy of the filed unredacted materials and one hard copy of the filed redacted materials on the attorney of record for each party to the proceeding, or where a party is not represented by an attorney, each party to the proceeding either by hand delivery, overnight delivery, or email, together with a proof of such service in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.47(g) of this chapter and Sec. 8.13(c)(1)(a) through (c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, materials marked as proprietary may be disclosed solely to the following persons, only for use in the proceeding, and only to the extent necessary to assist in the prosecution or defense of the case:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Counsel of record representing the parties in the complaint action and any support personnel employed by such attorneys;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Officers or employees of the opposing party who are named by the opposing party as being directly involved in the prosecution or defense of the case;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consultants or expert witnesses retained by the parties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Commission and its staff; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Court reporters and stenographers in accordance with the terms and conditions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Commission will entertain, subject to a proper showing under Sec. 0.459 of this chapter, a party's request to further restrict access to proprietary information. Pursuant to Sec. 0.459 of this chapter, the other parties will have an opportunity to respond to such requests. Requests and responses to requests may not be submitted by means of the Commission's Electronic Comment Filing System but instead must be filed under seal with the Office of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The individuals designated in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section shall not disclose information designated as proprietary to any person who is not authorized under this section to receive such information, and shall not use the information in any activity or function other than the prosecution or defense in the case before the Commission. Each individual who is provided access to the information shall sign a notarized statement affirmatively stating that the individual has personally reviewed the Commission's rules and understands the limitations they impose on the signing party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No copies of materials marked proprietary may be made except copies to be used by persons designated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Each party shall maintain a log recording the number of copies made of all proprietary material and the persons to whom the copies have been provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Upon termination of a complaint proceeding, including all appeals and petitions, all originals and reproductions of any proprietary materials, along with the log recording persons who received copies of such materials, shall be provided to the producing party. In addition, upon final termination of the proceeding, any notes or other work product derived in whole or in part from the proprietary materials of an opposing or third party shall be destroyed.
