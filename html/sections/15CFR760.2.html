                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Refusals to do business.</p><p class="depth0">Prohibition Against Refusals To Do Business</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No United States person may: refuse, knowingly agree to refuse,  require any other person to refuse, or knowingly agree to require any  other person to refuse, to do business with or in a boycotted country,  with any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted  country, with any national or resident of a boycotted country, or with  any other person, when such refusal is pursuant to an agreement with the  boycotting country, or a requirement of the boycotting country, or a  request from or on behalf of the boycotting country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Generally, a refusal to do business under this section consists  of action that excludes a person or country from a transaction for  boycott reasons. This includes a situation in which a United States  person chooses or selects one person over another on a boycott basis or  takes action to carry out another person's boycott-based selection when  he knows or has reason to know that the other person's selection is  boycott-based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Refusals to do business which are prohibited by this section  include not only specific refusals, but also refusals implied by a  course or pattern of conduct. There need not be a specific offer and  refusal to constitute a refusal to do business; a refusal may occur when  a United States person has a financial or commercial opportunity and  declines for boycott reasons to consider or accept it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A United States person's use of either a boycott-based list of  persons with whom he will not deal (a so-called ``blacklist'') or a  boycott-based list of   persons with whom he will deal (a so-called ``whitelist'') constitutes a  refusal to do business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> An agreement by a United States person to comply generally with  the laws of the boycotting country with which it is doing business or an  agreement that local laws of the boycotting country shall apply or  govern is not, in and of itself, a refusal to do business. Nor, in and  of itself, is use of a contractual clause explicitly requiring a person  to assume the risk of loss of non-delivery of his products a refusal to  do business with any person who will not or cannot comply with such a  clause. (But see Sec. 760.4 of this part on ``Evasion.'')</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If, for boycott reasons, a United States general manager chooses  one supplier over another, or enters into a contract with one supplier  over another, or advises its client to do so, then the general manager's  actions constitute a refusal to do business under this section. However,  it is not a refusal to do business under this section for a United  States person to provide management, procurement, or other pre-award  services for another person so long as the provision of such pre-award  services is customary for that firm (or industry of which the firm is a  part), without regard to the boycotting or non-boycotting character of  the countries in which they are performed, and the United States person,  in providing such services, does not act to exclude a person or country  from the transaction for boycott reasons, or otherwise take actions that  are boycott-based. For example, a United States person under contract to  provide general management services in connection with a construction  project in a boycotting country may compile lists of qualified bidders  for the client if that service is a customary one and if persons who are  qualified are not excluded from that list because they are blacklisted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> With respect to post-award services, if a client makes a  boycott-based selection, actions taken by the United States general  manager or contractor to carry out the client's choice are themselves  refusals to do business if the United States contractor knows or has  reason to know that the client's choice was boycott-based. (It is  irrelevant whether the United States contractor also provided pre-award  services.) Such actions include entering into a contract with the  selected supplier, notifying the supplier of the client's choice,  executing a contract on behalf of the client, arranging for inspection  and shipment of the supplier's goods, or taking any other action to  effect the client's choice. (But see Sec. 760.3(d) on ``Compliance with  Unilateral Selection'' as it may apply to post-award services.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> An agreement is not a prerequisite to a violation of this  section since the prohibition extends to actions taken pursuant not only  to agreements but also to requirements of, and requests from or on  behalf of, a boycotting country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Agreements under this section may be either express or implied  by a course or pattern of conduct. There need not be a direct request  from a boycotting country for action by a United States person to have  been taken pursuant to an agreement with or requirement of a boycotting  country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to  a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign  commerce of the United States and only when such activities are  undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an  unsanctioned foreign boycott. The mere absence of a business  relationship with or in the boycotted country, with any business concern  organized under the laws of the boycotted country, with national(s) or  resident(s) of the boycotted country, or with any other person does not  indicate the existence of the required intent.</p><p class="depth0">Examples of Refusals and Agreements To Refuse To Do Business</p><p class="depth0">The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining  the circumstances in which, in a boycott situation, a refusal to do  business or an agreement to refuse to do business is prohibited. They  are illustrative, not comprehensive.</p><p class="depth0">Refusals To Do Business</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, a U.S. manufacturer, receives an order for its products from  boycotting country Y. To fill that order, A solicits bids from   U.S. companies B and C, manufacturers of components used in A's  products. A does not, however, solicit bids from U.S. companies D or E,  which also manufacture such components, because it knows that D and E  are restricted from doing business in Y and that their products are,  therefore, not importable into that country.</p><p class="depth0">Company A may not refuse to solicit bids from D and E for boycott  reasons, because to do so would constitute a refusal to do business with  those persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A, a U.S. exporter, uses company B, a U.S. insurer, to insure  the shipment of its goods to all its overseas customers. For the first  time, A receives an order for its products from boycotting country Y.  Knowing that B is on the blacklist of Y, A arranges with company C, a  non-blacklisted U.S. insurer, to insure the shipment of its goods to Y.</p><p class="depth0">A's action constitutes a refusal to do business with B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A, a U.S. exporter, purchases all its liability insurance from  company B, a U.S. company that does business in boycotted country X. A  wishes to expand its operations into country Y, the boycotting country.  Before doing so, A decides to switch from insurer B to insurer C in  anticipation of a request from Y that A sever its relations with B as a  condition of doing business in Y.</p><p class="depth0">A may not switch insurers for this reason, because doing so would  constitute a refusal to do business with B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> U.S. company A exports goods to boycotting country Y. In  selecting vessels to transport the goods to Y, A chooses only from among  carriers which call at ports in Y.</p><p class="depth0">A's action is not a refusal to do business with carriers which do  not call at ports in Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A, a U.S. bank with a branch office in boycotting country Y,  sends representatives to boycotted country X to discuss plans for  opening a branch office in X. Upon learning of these discussions, an  official of the local boycott office in Y advises A's local branch  manager that if A opens an office in X it will no longer be allowed to  do business in Y. As a result of this notification, A decides to abandon  its plans to open a branch in X.</p><p class="depth0">Bank A may not abandon its plans to open a branch in X as a result  of Y's notification, because doing so would constitute a refusal to do  business in boycotted country X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A, a U.S. company that manufactures office equipment, has been  restricted from doing business in boycotting country Y because of its  business dealings with boycotted country X. In an effort to have itself  removed from Y's blacklist, A ceases its business in X.</p><p class="depth0">A's action constitutes a refusal to do business in boycotted country  X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A, a U.S. computer company, does business in boycotting  country Y. A decides to explore business opportunities in boycotted  country X. After careful analysis of possible business opportunities in  X, A decides, solely for business reasons, not to market its products in  X.</p><p class="depth0">A's decision not to proceed is not a refusal to do business, because  it is not based on boycott considerations. A has no affirmative  obligation to do business in X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> A, a U.S. oil company with operations in boycotting country  Y, has regularly purchased equipment from U.S. petroleum equipment  suppliers B, C, and D, none of whom is on the blacklist of Y. Because of  its satisfactory relationship with B, C, and D, A has not dealt with  other suppliers, including supplier E, who is blacklisted by Y.</p><p class="depth0">A's failure affirmatively to seek or secure business with  blacklisted supplier E is not a refusal to do business with E.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Same as (viii), except U.S. petroleum equipment supplier E, a  company on boycotting country Y's blacklist, offers to supply U.S. oil  company A with goods comparable to those provided by U.S. suppliers B,  C, and D. A, because it has satisfactorily, established relationships  with suppliers B, C, and D, does not accept supplier E's offer.</p><p class="depth0">A's refusal of supplier E's offer is not a refusal to do business,  because it is based solely on non-boycott considerations. A has no  affirmative obligation to do business with E.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> A, a U.S. construction company, enters into a contract to build  an office complex in boycotting country Y. A receives bids from B and C,  U.S. companies that are equally qualified suppliers of electrical cable  for the project. A knows that B is blacklisted by Y and that C is not. A  accepts C's bid, in part because C is as qualified as the other  potential supplier and in part because C is not blacklisted.</p><p class="depth0">A's decision to select supplier C instead of blacklisted supplier B  is a refusal to do business, because the boycott was one of the reasons  for A's decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> A, a U.S. general contractor, has been retained to construct a  highway in boycotting country Y. A circulates an invitation to bid to  U.S. manufacturers of road-building equipment. One of the conditions  listed in the invitation to bid is that, in order for A to obtain prompt  service, suppliers will be required to maintain a supply of spare parts  and a service facility in Y. A includes this condition solely for  commercial reasons unrelated to the boycott. Because of this condition,  however, those suppliers on Y's blacklist do not bid, since they would  be unable to satisfy the parts and services requirements.</p><p class="depth0">A's action is not a refusal to do business, because the contractual  condition was included solely for legitimate business reasons and was  not boycott-based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Company A, a U.S. oil company, purchases drill bits from U.S.  suppliers for export to boycotting country Y. In its purchase orders, A  includes a provision requiring the   supplier to make delivery to A's facilities in Y and providing that  title to the goods does not pass until delivery has been made. As is  customary under such an arrangement, the supplier bears all risks of  loss, including loss from fire, theft, perils of the sea, and inability  to clear customs, until title passes.</p><p class="depth0">Insistence on such an arrangement does not constitute a refusal to  do business, because this requirement is imposed on all suppliers  whether they are blacklisted or not. (But see Sec. 760.4 on  ``Evasion''.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> A, a U.S. engineering and construction company, contracts  with a government agency in boycotting country Y to perform a variety of  services in connection with the construction of a large industrial  facility in Y. Pursuant to this contract, A analyzes the market of  prospective suppliers, compiles a suggested bidders list, analyzes the  bids received, and makes recommendations to the client. The client  independently selects and awards the contract to supplier C for boycott  reasons. All of A's services are performed without regard to Y's  blacklist or any other boycott considerations, and are the type of  services A provides clients in both boycotting and non-boycotting  countries.</p><p class="depth0">A's actions do not constitute a refusal to do business, because, in  the provision of pre-award services, A has not excluded the other  bidders and because A customarily provides such services to its clients.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> Same as (xiii), except that in compiling a list of prospective  suppliers, A deletes suppliers he knows his client will refuse to select  because they are blacklisted. A knows that including the names of  blacklisted suppliers will neither enhance their chances of being  selected nor provide his client with a useful service, the function for  which he has been retained.</p><p class="depth0">A's actions, which amount to furnishing a so-called ``whitelist'',  constitute refusals to do business, because A's pre-award services have  not been furnished without regard to boycott considerations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> A, a U.S. construction firm, provides its boycotting country  client with a permissible list of prospective suppliers, B, C, D, and E.  The client independently selects and awards the contract to C, for  boycott reasons, and then requests A to advise C of his selection,  negotiate the contract with C, arrange for the shipment, and inspect the  goods upon arrival. A knows that C was chosen by the client for boycott  reasons.</p><p class="depth0">A's action in complying with his client's direction is a refusal to  do business, because A's post-award actions carry out his client's  boycott-based decision. (Note: Whether A's action comes within the  unilateral selection exception depends upon factors discussed in Sec.  760.3(d) of this part).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> Same as (xv), except that A is building the project on a  turnkey basis and will retain title until completion. The client  instructs A to contract only with C.</p><p class="depth0">A's action in contracting with C constitutes a refusal to do  business, because it is action that excludes blacklisted persons from  the transaction for boycott reasons. (Note: Whether A's action comes  within the unilateral selection exception depends upon factors discussed  in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvii)</em> A, a U.S. exporter of machine tools, receives an order for  drill presses from boycotting country Y. The cover letter from Y's  procurement official states that A was selected over other U.S.  manufacturers in part because A is not on Y's blacklist.</p><p class="depth0">A's action in filling this order is not a refusal to do business,  because A has not excluded anyone from the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xviii)</em> A, a U.S. engineering firm under contract to construct a dam  in boycotting country Y, compiles, on a non-boycott basis, a list of  potential heavy equipment suppliers, including information on their  qualifications and prior experience. A then solicits bids from the top  three firms on its list--B, C, and D--because they are the best  qualified. None of them happens to be blacklisted. A does not solicit  bids from E, F, or G, the next three firms on the list, one of whom is  on Y's blacklist.</p><p class="depth0">A's decision to solicit bids from only B, C, and D, is not a refusal  to do business with any person, because the solicited bidders were not  selected for boycott reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xix)</em> U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.  beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he is not  blacklisted. B meets all other conditions of the letter of credit but  refuses to certify as to his blacklist status. A refuses to pay B on the  letter of credit solely because B refuses to certify as to his blacklist  status.</p><p class="depth0">A has refused to do business with another person pursuant to a  boycott requirement or request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xx)</em> U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.  beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to provide a  certification from the steamship line that the vessel carrying the goods  is not blacklisted. B seeks payment from A and meets all other  conditions of the letter of credit but refuses or is unable to provide  the certification from the steamship line about the vessel's blacklist  status. A refuses to pay B on the letter of credit solely because B  cannot or will not provide the certification.</p><p class="depth0">A has required another person to refuse to do business pursuant to a  boycott requirement or request by insisting that B obtain such a  certificate. (Either A or B may request an amendment to the letter of  credit substituting a certificate of vessel eligibility, however. See  Example (xxi) below).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxi)</em> U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit from a bank in  boycotting country Y in favor of U.S. beneficiary B. The letter of   credit requires B to provide a certification from the steamship line  that the vessel carrying the goods is eligible to enter the ports in Y.  B seeks payment from A and meets all other conditions of the letter of  credit. A refuses to pay B solely because B cannot or will not provide  the certification.</p><p class="depth0">A has neither refused, nor required another person to refuse, to do  business with another person pursuant to a boycott requirement or  request because a request for a vessel eligibility certificate to be  furnished by the steamship line is not a prohibited condition. (See  Supplement No. 1 to this part, paragraph (I)(B), ``Shipping  Certificate''.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxii)</em> U.S. bank A confirms a letter of credit in favor of U.S.  beneficiary B. The letter of credit contains a requirement that B  certify that he is not blacklisted. B presents the letter of credit to  U.S. bank C, a correspondent of bank A. B does not present the  certificate of blacklist status to bank C, but, in accordance with these  rules, bank C pays B, and then presents the letter of credit and  documentation to bank A for reimbursement. Bank A refuses to reimburse  bank C because the blacklist certification of B is not included in the  documentation.</p><p class="depth0">A has required another person to refuse to do business with a person  pursuant to a boycott requirement or request by insisting that C obtain  the certificate from B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxiii)</em> U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.  beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he is not  blacklisted. B fails to provide such a certification when he presents  the documents to A for payment. A notifies B that the certification has  not been submitted.</p><p class="depth0">A has not refused to do business with another person pursuant to a  boycott requirement by notifying B of the omitted certificate. A may not  refuse to pay on the letter of credit, however, if B states that B will  not provide such a certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxiv)</em> U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.  beneficiary B from the issuing bank for the purpose of confirmation,  negotiation or payment. The letter of credit requires B to certify that  he is not blacklisted. A notifies B that it is contrary to the policy of  A to handle letters of credit containing this condition and that, unless  an amendment is obtained deleting this condition, A will not implement  the letter of credit.</p><p class="depth0">A has not refused to do business with another person pursuant to a  boycott requirement, because A has indicated its policy against  implementing the letter of credit containing the term without regard to  B's ability or willingness to furnish such a certificate.</p><p class="depth0">Agreements To Refuse To Do Business</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, a U.S. construction firm, is retained by an agency of  boycotting country Y to build a primary school. The proposed contract  contains a clause stating that A ``may not use goods or services in the  project that are produced or provided by any person restricted from  having a business relationship with country Y by reason of Y's boycott  against country X''.</p><p class="depth0">A's action in entering into such a contract would constitute an  agreement to refuse to do business, because it is an agreement to  exclude blacklisted persons from the transaction. A may, however,  renegotiate this clause so that it does not contain terms prohibited by  this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A, a U.S. manufacturer of commercial refrigerators and  freezers, receives an invitation to bid from boycotting country Y. The  tender states that the bidder must agree not to deal with companies on  Y's blacklist. A does not know which companies are on the blacklist;  however, A submits a bid without taking exception to the boycott  conditions. A's bid makes no commitment regarding not dealing with  certain companies.</p><p class="depth0">At the point when A submits its bid without taking exception to the  boycott request in Y's tender, A has agreed to refuse to do business  with blacklisted persons, because the terms of Y's tender require A to  agree to refuse to do business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A, a U.S. construction firm, is offered a contract to perform  engineering and construction services in connection with a project  located in boycotting country Y. The contract contains a clause stating  that, in the event of a contract dispute, the laws of Y will apply.</p><p class="depth0">A may enter into the contract. Agreement that the laws of boycotting  country Y will control in resolving a contract dispute is not an  agreement to refuse to do business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Same as (iii), except that the contract contains a clause that  A and its employees will comply with the laws of boycotting country Y. A  knows that Y has a number of boycott laws.</p><p class="depth0">Such an agreement is not, in and of itself, an agreement to refuse  to do business. If, however, A subsequently refuses to do business with  someone because of the laws of Y, A's action would be a refusal to do  business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Same as (iv), except that the contract contains a clause that A  and its employees will comply with the laws of boycotting country Y,  ``including boycott laws.''</p><p class="depth0">A's agreeing, without qualification, to comply with local boycott  laws constitutes an agreement to refuse to do business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Same as (v), except that A inserts a proviso ``except insofar  as Y's laws conflict with U.S. laws,'' or words to that effect.</p><p class="depth0">Such an agreement is not an agreement to refuse to do business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A, a U.S. general contractor, is retained to construct a  pipeline in boycotting   country Y. A provision in the proposed contract stipulates that in  purchasing equipment, supplies, and services A must give preference to  companies located in host country Y.</p><p class="depth0">A may agree to this contract provision. Agreeing to a ``buy local''  contract provision is not an agreement to refuse to do business, because  A's agreement is not made for boycott reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> A, a U.S. exporter planning to sell retail goods to customers  in boycotting country Y, enters into a contract to purchase goods  wholesale from B, a U.S. appliance manufacturer. A's contract with B  includes a provision stipulating that B may not use components or  services of blacklisted companies in the manufacture of its appliances.</p><p class="depth0">A's contract constitutes a refusal to do business, because it would  require another person, B, to refuse to do business with other persons  for boycott reasons. B may not agree to such a contract, because it  would be agreeing to refuse to do business with other persons for  boycott reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Same as (viii), except that A and B reach an implicit  understanding that B will not use components or services of blacklisted  companies in the manufacture of goods to be exported to Y. In the  manufacture of appliances to be sold to A for export to non-boycotting  countries, B uses components manufactured by blacklisted companies.</p><p class="depth0">The actions of both A and B constitute agreement to refuse to do  business. The agreement is implied by their pattern of conduct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Y opens a  letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. The letter of credit  specifies that negotiation of the letter of credit with a bank that  appears on the country X boycott blacklist is prohibited. U.S. bank A,  C's correspondent bank, advises B of the letter of credit. B presents  documentation to bank A seeking to be paid on the letter of credit,  without amending or otherwise taking exception to the boycott condition.</p><p class="depth0">B has agreed to refuse to do business with blacklisted banks  because, by presenting the letter of credit for payment, B has accepted  all of its terms and conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Discriminatory actions.</p><p class="depth0">Prohibition Against Taking Discriminatory Actions</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No United States person may:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Refuse to employ or otherwise discriminate against any  individual who is a United States person on the basis of race, religion,  sex, or national origin;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Discriminate against any corporation or other organization  which is a United States person on the basis of the race, religion, sex,  or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such  corporation or organization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Knowingly agree to take any of the actions described in  paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Require or knowingly agree to require any other person to take  any of the actions described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This prohibition shall apply whether the discriminatory action  is taken by a United States person on its own or in response to an  agreement with, request from, or requirement of a boycotting country.  This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United  States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the  United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent  to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The section does not supersede or limit the operation of the  civil rights laws of the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Examples of Discriminatory Actions</p><p class="depth0">The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining  the circumstances in which the taking of particular discriminatory  actions is prohibited. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> U.S. construction company A is awarded a contract to build an  office complex in boycotting country Y. A, believing that employees of a  particular religion will not be permitted to work in Y because of Y's  boycott against country X, excludes U.S. persons of that religion from  consideration for employment on the project.</p><p class="depth0">A's refusal to consider qualified U.S. persons of a particular  religion for work on the project in Y constitutes a prohibited boycott- based discriminatory action against U.S. persons on the basis of  religion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Same as (i), except that a clause in the contract provides that  ``no persons of country X origin are to work on this project.''</p><p class="depth0">A's agreement constitutes a prohibited boycott-based agreement to  discriminate against U.S. persons, among others, on the basis of  national origin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Same as (i), except that a clause in the contract provides  that ``no persons who are citizens, residents, or nationals of country X  are to work on this project.''</p><p class="depth0">A's agreement does not constitute a boycott-based agreement to  discriminate against U.S. persons on the basis of race, religion, sex,  or national origin, because the clause requires exclusion on the basis  of citizenship, residency, and nationality only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> U.S. construction company A enters into a contract to build a  school in boycotting country Y. Y's representative orally tells A that  no persons of country X origin are to work on the project.</p><p class="depth0">A may not comply, because to do so would constitute discrimination  on the basis of national origin.</p><p class="depth0">It makes no difference that A learned of Y's requirement orally. It  makes no difference how A learns about Y's discriminatory requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Boycotting country Y tenders an invitation to bid on a  construction project in Y. The tender requires that the successful  bidder's personnel will be interviewed and that persons of a particular  religious faith will not be permitted to work on the project. Y's  requirement is based on its boycott of country X, the majority of whose  citizens are of that particular faith.</p><p class="depth0">Agreement to this provision in the tender document by a U.S. person  would constitute a prohibited agreement to engage in boycott-based  discrimination against U.S. persons of a particular religion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Same as (v), except that the tender specifies that ``women will  not be allowed to work on this project.''</p><p class="depth0">Agreement to this provision in the tender by a U.S. person does not  constitute a prohibited agreement to engage in boycott-based  discrimination, because the restriction against employment of women is  not boycott-based.

The invitation  states that all bidders must include information concerning similar  types of buildings they have designed. A has not designed such buildings  in boycotted country X. Clients frequently seek information of this type  before engaging an architect.</p><p class="depth0">A may furnish this information, because this is furnishing normal  business information, in a commercial context, relating to A's technical  competence and professional experience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> U.S. oil company A distributes to potential customers  promotional brochures and catalogs which give background information on  A's past projects.

A knows or has reason to know that although B  has an address outside the United States, B is a U.S. person.</p><p class="depth0">The letter of credit is presumed to apply to a transaction in U.S.  commerce, because the letter of credit calls for shipment of U.S.-origin  goods. In addition, the letter of credit is presumed to be in favor of a  beneficiary who   is a U.S. person, because A knows or has reason to know that the  beneficiary is a U.S. person despite the foreign address.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A, a U.S. bank branch located outside the United States, opens a  letter of credit which specifies a beneficiary with a U.S. address. The  letter of credit calls for documents indicating shipment of foreign- origin goods.</p><p class="depth0">The letter of credit is presumed to be in favor of a U.S.  beneficiary but to apply to a transaction outside U.S. commerce, because  it calls for documents indicating shipment of foreign-origin goods. The  presumption of non-U.S. commerce may be rebutted by facts showing that A  could reasonably conclude that the underlying transaction involves  shipment of U.S.-origin goods or goods from the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Prohibition Against Implementing Letters of Credit</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Y opens a  letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. The letter of credit  specifies as a condition of payment that B certify that it does not do  business with boycotted country X. Foreign bank C forwards the letter of  credit it has opened to U.S. bank A for confirmation.</p><p class="depth0">A may not confirm or otherwise implement this letter of credit,  because it contains a condition with which a U.S. person may not comply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Same as (i), except U.S. bank A desires to advise the  beneficiary, U.S. company B, of the letter of credit.</p><p class="depth0">A may do so, because advising the beneficiary of the letter of  credit (including the term which prevents A from implementing it) is not  implementation of the letter of credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Same as (i), except foreign bank C sends a telegram to U.S.  bank A stating the major terms and conditions of the letter of credit.  The telegram does not reflect the boycott provision. Subsequently, C  mails to A documents setting forth the terms and conditions of the  letter of credit, including the prohibited boycott condition.</p><p class="depth0">A may not further implement the letter of credit after it receives  the documents, because they reflect the prohibited boycott condition in  the letter of credit. A may advise the beneficiary and C of the  existence of the letter of credit (including the boycott term), and may  perform any essentially ministerial acts necessary to dispose of the  letter of credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Same as (iii), except that U.S. company B, based in part on  information received from U.S. bank A, desires to obtain an amendment to  the letter of credit which would eliminate or nullify the language in  the letter of credit which prevents A from paying or otherwise  implementing it.</p><p class="depth0">Either company B or bank A may undertake, and the other may  cooperate and assist in, this endeavor. A could then pay or otherwise  implement the revised letter of credit, so long as the original  prohibited boycott condition is of no force or effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Boycotting country Y requests a foreign bank in Y to open a  letter of credit to effect payment for goods to be shipped by U.S.  supplier B, the beneficiary of the letter of credit. The letter of  credit contains prohibited boycott clauses. The foreign bank forwards a  copy of the letter of credit to its branch office A, in the United  States.</p><p class="depth0">A may advise the beneficiary but may not implement the letter of  credit, because it contains prohibited boycott conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. U.S.  bank A is asked to implement, for the benefit of B, a letter of credit  which contains a clause requiring documentation that the goods shipped  are not of boycotted country X origin.</p><p class="depth0">A may not implement the letter of credit with a prohibited  condition, and may accept only a positive certificate of origin as  satisfactory documentation. (See Sec. 760.3(c) on ``Import and Shipping  Document Requirements.'')</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> B is a foreign bank located outside the United States. B  maintains an account with U.S. bank A, located in the United States. A  letter of credit issued by B in favor of a U.S. beneficiary provides  that any negotiating bank may obtain reimbursement from A by certifying  that all the terms and conditions of the letter of credit have been met  and then drawing against B's account. B notifies A by cable of the  issuance of a letter of credit and the existence of reimbursement  authorization; A does not receive a copy of the letter of credit.</p><p class="depth0">A may reimburse any negotiating bank, even when the underlying  letter of credit contains a prohibited boycott condition, because A does  not know or have reason to know that the letter of credit contains a  prohibited boycott condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Same as (viii), except that foreign bank B forwards a copy of  the letter of credit to U.S. bank A, which then becomes aware of the  prohibited boycott clause.</p><p class="depth0">A may not thereafter reimburse a negotiating bank or in any way  further implement the letter of credit, because it knows of the  prohibited boycott condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. exporter B and  requests a foreign bank in Y to open a letter of credit in favor of B to  cover the cost. The letter of credit contains a prohibited boycott  clause. The foreign bank asks U.S. bank A to advise and confirm the  letter of credit. Through inadvertence, A does not notice the prohibited  clause and confirms the letter of credit. A   thereafter notices the clause and then refuses to honor B's draft  against the letter of credit. B sues bank A for payment.</p><p class="depth0">A has an absolute defense against the obligation to make payment  under this letter of credit. (Note: Examples (ix) and (x) do not alter  any other obligations or liabilities of the parties under appropriate  law.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. A  letter of credit which contains a prohibited boycott clause is opened in  favor of B by a foreign bank in Y. The foreign bank asks U.S. bank A to  advise and confirm the letter of credit, which it forwards to A.</p><p class="depth0">A may advise B that it has received the letter of credit (including  the boycott term), but may not confirm the letter of credit with the  prohibited clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Same as (xii), except U.S. bank A fails to tell B that it  cannot process the letter of credit. B requests payment.</p><p class="depth0">A may not pay. If the prohibited language is eliminated or nullified  as the result of renegotiation, A may then pay or otherwise implement  the revised letter of credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.  beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he is not  blacklisted.</p><p class="depth0">A may implement such a letter of credit, but it may not insist that  the certification be furnished, because by so insisting it would be  refusing to do business with a blacklisted person in compliance with a  boycott.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> A, a U.S. bank located in the U.S. opens a letter of credit in  favor of U.S. beneficiary B for B's sale of goods to boycotting country  Y. The letter of credit contains no boycott conditions, but A knows that  Y customarily requires the seller of goods to certify that it has dealt  with no blacklisted supplier. A, therefore, instructs B that it will not  make payment under the letter of credit unless B makes such a  certification.</p><p class="depth0">A's action in requiring the certification from B constitutes action  to require another person to refuse to do business with blacklisted  persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> A, a U.S. bank located in the U.S., opens a letter of credit  in favor of U.S. beneficiary B for B's sale of goods to boycotting  country Y. The letter of credit contains no boycott conditions, but A  has actual knowledge that B has agreed to supply a certification to Y  that it has not dealt with blacklisted firms, as a condition of  receiving the letter of credit in its favor.</p><p class="depth0">A may not implement the letter of credit, because it knows that an  implicit condition of the credit is a condition with which B may not  legally comply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvii)</em> Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Y  opens a letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. The letter  of credit includes the statement, ``Do not negotiate with blacklisted  banks.'' C forwards the letter of credit it has opened to U.S. bank A  for confirmation.</p><p class="depth0">A may not confirm or otherwise implement this letter of credit,  because it contains a condition with which a U.S. person may not comply.
