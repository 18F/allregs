                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Classification. Classified information generated or possessed by  a licensee, certificate holder, or other person must be appropriately  marked. Classified material which is not conducive to markings (e.g.,  equipment) may be exempt from this requirement. These exemptions are  subject to the approval of the CSA on a case-by-case basis. If a person  or facility generates or possesses information that is believed to be  classified based on guidance provided by the NRC or by derivation from  classified documents, but   which no authorized classifier has determined to be classified, the  information must be protected and marked with the appropriate  classification markings pending review and signature of an NRC  authorized classifier. This information shall be protected as classified  information pending final determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification consistent with content. Each document containing  classified information shall be classified Secret or Confidential  according to its content. NRC licensees, certificate holders, or other  persons subject to the requirements of 10 CFR part 95 may not make  original classification decisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Markings required on face of documents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For derivative  classification of classified National Security Information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Derivative classifications of classified National Security  Information must contain the identity of the source document or the  classification guide, including the agency and office of origin, on the  ``Derived From'' line and its classification date. If more than one  source is cited, the ``Derived From'' line should indicate ``Multiple  Sources.'' The derivative classifier shall maintain the identification  of each source with the file or record copy of the derivatively  classified document.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Declassification instructions. When marking derivatively  classified documents, the ``DECLASSIFY ON'' line must carry forward the  declassification instructions as reflected in the original document. If  multiple sources are used, the instructions will carry forward the  longest duration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An example of the marking stamp is as follows:</p><p class="depth4">Derived from___________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth4"><em>(Source/Date)</em></p><p class="depth4">Reason:________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth4">Declassify On:_________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth4"><em>(Date/Event/Exemption)</em></p><p class="depth4">Classifier:____________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth4"><em>(Name/Title/Number)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For Restricted Data documents:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identity of the classifier. The identity of the classifier must  be shown by completion of the ``Derivative Classifier'' line. The  ``Derivative Classifier'' line must show the name of the person  classifying the document and the basis for the classification. Dates for  downgrading or declassification do not apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Classification designation (e.g., Secret, Confidential) and  Restricted Data. NOTE: No ``Declassification'' instructions will be  placed on documents containing Restricted Data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Placement of markings. The highest classification marking  assigned to a document must be placed in a conspicuous fashion in  letters at the top and bottom of the outside of the front covers and  title pages, if any, and first and last pages on which text appears, on  both bound and unbound documents, and on the outside of back covers of  bound documents. The balance of the pages must be marked at the top and  bottom with:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The overall classification marking assigned to the document;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The highest classification marking required by content of the  page; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The marking UNCLASSIFIED if they have no classified content.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional markings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the document contains any form of  Restricted Data, it must bear the appropriate marking on the first page  of text, on the front cover and title page, if any. For example: ``This  document contains Restricted Data as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of  1954. Unauthorized disclosure subject to Administrative and Criminal  Sanctions.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitation on reproduction or dissemination. If the originator  or classifier determines that reproduction or further dissemination of a  document should be restricted, the following additional wording may be  placed on the face of the document:  Reproduction or Further Dissemination Requires Approval of ________________________________________________________________________ If any portion of this additional marking does not apply, it should be  crossed out.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Portion markings. In addition to the information required on the  face of the document, each classified document is required, by marking  or other means, to indicate clearly which portions are classified (e.g.,  paragraphs or pages) and which portions are not classified. The symbols  (S) for Secret, (C) for Confidential, (U) for Unclassified, or (RD) for  Restricted Data may be   used immediately preceding or following the text to which it applies,  except that the designation must follow titles or subjects. (Portion  marking of paragraphs is not required for documents containing  Restricted Data.) If this type of portion marking is not practicable,  the document must contain a description sufficient to identify the  classified information and the unclassified information.</p><p class="depth2">Example  Pages 1-3 Secret Pages 4-19 Unclassified Pages 20-26 Secret Pages 27-32 Confidential</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Transmittal document. If a document transmitting classified  information contains no classified information or the classification  level of the transmittal document is not as high as the highest  classification level of its enclosures, then the document must be marked  at the top and bottom with a classification at least as high as its  highest classified enclosure. The classification may be higher if the  enclosures, when combined, warrant a higher classification than any  individual enclosure. When the contents of the transmittal document  warrants a lower classification than the highest classified enclosure(s)  or combination of enclosures or requires no classification, a stamp or  marking such as the following must also be used on the transmittal  document:</p><p class="depth2">UPON REMOVAL OF ATTACHMENTS THIS DOCUMENT IS:  (Classification level of transmittal document standing alone or the word  ``UNCLASSIFIED'' if the transmittal document contains no classified  information.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Classification challenges. Licensees, certificate holders, or  other persons in authorized possession of classified National Security  Information who in good faith believe that the information's  classification status (i.e., that the document), is classified at either  too high a level for its content (overclassification) or too low for its  content (underclassification) are expected to challenge its  classification status. Licensees, certificate holders, or other persons  who wish to challenge a classification status shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Refer the document or information to the originator or to an  authorized NRC classifier for review. The authorized classifier shall  review the document and render a written classification decision to the  holder of the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event of a question regarding classification review, the  holder of the information or the authorized classifier shall consult the  NRC Division of Facilities and Security, Information Security Branch,  for assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Licensees, certificate holders, or other persons who challenge  classification decisions have the right to appeal the classification  decision to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Licensees, certificate holders, or other persons seeking to  challenge the classification of information will not be the subject of  retribution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Files, folders or group of documents. Files, folders, binders,  or groups of physically connected documents must be marked at least as  high as the highest classified document which they contain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Drafts and working papers. Drafts of documents and working  papers which contain, or which are believed to contain, classified  information must be marked as classified information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Classification guidance. Licensees, certificate holders, or  other persons subject to this part shall classify and mark classified  matter as National Security Information or Restricted Data, as  appropriate, in accordance with classification guidance provided by the  NRC as part of the facility clearance process.
