                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The sea carrier's module. The Sea Carrier's Module is a  component of the Automated Export System (AES) (see, part 192, subpart  B, of this chapter) that allows for the filing of outbound vessel  manifest information electronically (see, 15 CFR part 30). All sea  carriers are eligible to apply for participation in the Sea Carrier's  Module. Application and certification procedures for AES are found at 15  CFR 30.60. A sea carrier certified to use the module that adheres to the  procedures set forth in this section and the Census Regulations (15 CFR  part 30) concerning the electronic submission of an outbound vessel  manifest information meets the outward cargo declaration filing  requirements (CF 1302-A) of Sec. Sec. 4.63 and 4.75, except as  otherwise provided in Sec. Sec. 4.75 and 4.84.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> by  which the participant carriers are otherwise bound.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Messages required to be filed within the sea carrier's module.  Participant carriers will be responsible for transmitting and responding  to the following messages:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Booking. Booking information identifies all the freight that is  scheduled for export. Booking information will be transmitted to Customs  via AES for each shipment as far in advance of departure as practical,  but no later than seventy-two hours prior to departure for all  information available at that time. Bookings received within seventy-two  hours of departure will be transmitted to Customs via AES as received;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Receipt of booking. When the carrier receives the cargo or  portion of the cargo that was booked, the carrier will inform Customs so  that Customs can determine if an examination of the cargo is necessary.  Customs will notify the carrier of shipments designated for examination.  Customs will also notify the carrier when the shipment designated for  inspection is released and may be loaded on the vessel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Departure. No later than the first calendar day following the  actual departure of the vessel, the carrier will notify Customs of the  date and time of departure; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Manifest. Within ten (10) calendar days after the departure of  the vessel from each port, the carrier will submit the manifest  information to Customs via AES for each booking loaded on the departed  vessel. However, if the destination of the vessel is a foreign port  listed in Sec. 4.75(c), the carrier must transmit complete manifest  information before vessel departure. Time requirements for transmission  of complete manifest information for carriers destined to Puerto Rico  and U.S. possessions are the same as the requirement for the submission  of the complete manifest as found in Sec. 4.84.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All penalties and liquidated damages that apply to the  submission of   paper manifests (see, applicable provisions in this part) apply to the  electronic submission of outbound vessel manifest information through  the Sea Carrier's Module.  [T.D. 99-57, 64 FR 40986, July 28, 1999]</p><p class="depth2">Coastwise Procedure</p>
