We refer to these as constant-speed governors in this section.  Paragraph (a) of this section also applies for any engines shipped  without installed governors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The representative-testing requirements of 40 CFR 1065.10(c)(1)  related to in-use duty cycles do not apply to engines you produce and  ship without constant-speed governors if you comply with all the  following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must have test data showing that the effectiveness of the  engine's emission controls over the expected range of in-use operation  will be similar to that measured over the specified duty cycle.  Alternatively, if your emission controls depend on maintaining a  consistent air-fuel ratio, you may demonstrate that the engine is  calibrated to maintain a consistent air-fuel ratio over the expected  range of in-use operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe in your application for certification the data and  analysis that supports your conclusion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> to remove a governor from a certified engine unless you  recertify the engine in the modified configuration.</p>
