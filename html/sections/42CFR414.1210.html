The list of groups of physicians subject to the value-based payment modifier for the CY 2015 payment adjustment period is based on a query of PECOS on October 15, 2013. For each subsequent calendar year payment adjustment period, the list of groups and solo practitioners subject to the value-based payment modifier is based on a query of PECOS that occurs within 10 days of the close of the Physician Quality Reporting System group registration process during the applicable performance period described at Sec. 414.1215. Groups are removed from the PECOS-generated list if, based on a claims analysis, the group did not have the required number of eligible professionals, as defined in Sec. 414.1210(a), that submitted claims during the performance period for the applicable calendar year payment adjustment period. Solo practitioners are removed from the PECOS-generated list if, based on a claims analysis, the solo practitioner did not submit claims during the performance period for the applicable calendar year payment adjustment period.
