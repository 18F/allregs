If the National Coordinator determines that an ONC-ACB's status should not be revoked, the National Coordinator will notify the ONC-ACB's authorized representative in writing of this determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Revocation. (1) The National Coordinator may revoke an ONC-ACB's status if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A determination is made that revocation is appropriate after considering the information provided by the ONC-ACB in response to the proposed revocation notice; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The ONC-ACB does not respond to a proposed revocation notice within the specified timeframe in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A decision to revoke an ONC-ACB's status is final and not subject to further review unless the National Coordinator chooses to reconsider the revocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Extent and duration of revocation.
