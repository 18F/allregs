                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Will I receive an acknowledgment letter? Yes. If you have  provided all necessary information to process your claim (such as time,  date, and place where the incident occurred, and a specific sum of money  you are requesting as damages), you will receive an acknowledgment  letter indicating the filing date and a claim number. The filing date is  the date your claim was first received by either the Department of  Justice or an office of the Bureau of Prisons. You should refer to your  claim number in all further correspondences with the agency.  Additionally, you must inform the agency of any changes in your address.  If you fail to provide all necessary information, your claim will be  rejected and returned to you requesting supplemental information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Will I be notified if my claim is transferred? Yes. If your  claim is improperly filed, you will be notified by the responsible  office that your claim was transferred to another regional office, the  Central Office, a training center, or another agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Will an investigation be conducted? Yes. The regional office  ordinarily refers the claim to the appropriate institution or office for  investigation. You may also be required to provide additional  information during the investigation. Your failure to respond within a  reasonable time may result in the rejection or denial of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Who will decide my administrative claim? The Regional Counsel or  his or her designee reviews the investigation and the supporting  evidence and renders a decision of all claims properly filed in the  regional office and within regional settlement authority. The Regional  Counsel has limited settlement authority (up to an amount established by  the Director, Bureau of Prisons). After considering the merits of the  claim, the Regional Counsel may deny   or propose a settlement of the claim. The General Counsel will  investigate and propose settlement for all claims properly filed in the  Central Office in accordance with delegated settlement authority. If the  proposed settlement exceeds the General Counsel's authority, the General  Counsel will seek approval from the appropriate Department of Justice  officers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Will my claim be reviewed by or referred to the Central Office?  If the Regional Counsel recommends a proposed settlement in excess of  the settlement authority, the claim will be forwarded, with a  recommendation, to the Office of General Counsel, Central Office for  their review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Will appreciation or depreciation be considered? Yes. Staff will  consider appreciation or depreciation of lost or damaged property in  settling a claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If my claim is denied or I am dissatisfied with a settlement  offer, what are my options? If your claim is denied or you are  dissatisfied with a settlement offer, you may request, in writing, that  the Bureau of Prisons reconsider your claim in the administrative stage.  You should include additional evidence of injury or loss to support your  request for reconsideration. If you are dissatisfied with the final  agency action, you may file suit in an appropriate U.S. District Court  as no further administrative action is available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> What if I accept a settlement of my claim? If you accept a  settlement, you give up your right to bring a lawsuit against the United  States or against any employee of the government whose action or lack of  action gave rise to your claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> How long will it take to get a response? Generally, you will  receive a decision regarding your claim within six months of when you  properly file the claim. If you have not received a letter either  proposing a settlement or denying your claim within six months after the  date your claim was filed, you may assume your claim is denied. You may  proceed to file a lawsuit in the appropriate U.S. District Court.</p>
