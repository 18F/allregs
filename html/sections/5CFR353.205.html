                            <p class="depth0">Periods allowed for return to duty are based on the length of time  the person was performing service in the uniformed services, as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An employee whose uniformed service was for less than 31 days,  or who was absent for the purpose of an examination to determine fitness  for the uniformed services, is required to report back to work not later  than the beginning of the first regularly scheduled work day on the  first full calendar day following completion of the period of service  and the expiration of 8 hours after a period allowing for the safe  transportation of the employee from the place of service to the  employee's residence, or as soon as possible after the expiration of the  8-hour period if reporting within the above period is impossible or  unreasonable through no fault of the employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the service was for more than 30 but less than 181 days, the  employee must submit an application for reemployment with the agency not  later than 14 days after completing the period of service. (If  submitting the application is impossible or unreasonable through no  fault of the individual, it must be submitted the next full calendar day  when it becomes possible to do so.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the period of service was for more than 180 days, the  employee must submit an application for reemployment not later than 90  days after completing the period of service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An employee who is hospitalized or convalescing from an injury  or illness incurred in, or aggravated during uniformed service is  required to report for duty at the end of the period that is necessary  for the person to recover, based on the length of service as discussed  in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, except that the period  of recovery may not exceed 2 years (extended by the minimum time  required to accommodate circumstances beyond the employee's control  which make reporting within the period specified impossible or  unreasonable).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A person who does not report within the time limits specified  does not automatically forfeit restoration rights, but, rather, is  subject to whatever policy and disciplinary action the agency would  normally apply for a similar absence without authorization.</p>
