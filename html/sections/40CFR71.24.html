                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where to file. To apply for a compliance extension and an  alternative emission limitation under this subpart, the owner or  operator of an early reductions source shall file a complete permit  application with the appropriate EPA Regional Office. The owner or  operator shall also send a copy of the application to the appropriate  State agency; to the EPA Emission Standards Division, Mail Drop 13,  Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, 27711 (attention: Early  Reductions Officer); and to the EPA Office of Enforcement, EN-341W, 1200  Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460 (attention: Early  Reductions Officer).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deadlines. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Permit applications under this subpart for early  reductions sources not subject to enforceable commitments shall be  submitted by the later of the following dates:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 120 days after proposal of an otherwise applicable standard  issued under section 112(d) of the Act; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> March 21, 1995.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permit applications for early reductions sources subject to  enforceable commitments established pursuant to Sec. 63.75 of this  chapter shall be filed no later than April 30, 1994.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the post-reduction year does not end at least one month  before the permit application deadline under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2)  of this section, the source may file the post-reduction emissions  information required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section later as a  supplement to the original permit application. In such cases, this  supplemental information shall be submitted to the Administrator no  later than one month after the end of the post-reduction year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a source test will be the supporting basis for establishing  post-reduction emissions for one or more emissions units in the early  reductions source, the test results shall be submitted by the deadline  for submittal of a permit application under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Complete application. To be found complete, an application must  provide all information required pursuant to paragraph (e) of this  section, except for the information on post-reduction emissions required  under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Applications for permit revision  need supply the information required under paragraph (e) of this section  only if it is related to the proposed change. Information submitted  under paragraph (e) of this section must be sufficient to allow the  Administrator to determine if the early reductions source meets the  applicable requirements of subpart D of part 63 of this chapter. Unless  the Administrator determines that an application is not complete within  45 days of receipt of the application, such application shall be deemed  to be complete, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 71.26(a)(3). If,  while processing an application that has been determined or deemed to be  complete, the Administrator determines that additional information is  necessary to evaluate or take final action on that application, the  Administrator may request such information in writing and set a  reasonable deadline for a response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Duty to supplement or correct application. Any applicant who  fails to submit any relevant facts or who has submitted incorrect  information in a permit application shall, upon becoming aware of such  failure or incorrect submittal, promptly submit such supplementary facts  or corrected information. In addition, an applicant shall provide  additional or revised information as necessary to address any  requirements of subpart D of part 63 of this chapter (Compliance  Extensions for Early Reductions) or of this subpart that become  applicable to the early reductions source after the date it filed a  complete application but prior to release of a draft permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Required information. The following elements are required  information for permit applications under this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identifying information, including company name, telephone  number, and address (or plant name, telephone number, and address if  different from the company name); owner's name, telephone number, and  agent; and telephone number(s) and name(s) of plant site manager/ contact;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All information required in Sec. 63.74 of this chapter,  including that needed to describe the early reductions source, its base  year and post-reduction emissions, and supporting basis for the  emissions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement of the proposed alternative emission limitation for  hazardous air pollutants from the early reductions source on an annual  basis, reflecting the emission reductions required to qualify the early  reductions source for a compliance extension under subpart D of part 63  of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Additional emission limiting requirements, such as work practice  standards or limitations on operation, which are necessary to assure  proper operation of installed control equipment and compliance with the  annual alternative emission limitation for the early reductions source;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Information necessary to define alternative operating scenarios  for the early reductions source or permit terms and conditions for  trading hazardous air pollutant increases and decreases under Sec.  71.25(a)(10), including any associated permit terms and conditions  needed to assure compliance with the alternative emission limitation  under the alternative operating scenarios or pollutant trading; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Statements related to compliance meeting the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement of methods proposed to determine compliance by the  early reductions source with the proposed alternative emission  limitation, including a description of monitoring devices and  activities, emission calculation procedures, recordkeeping, and  reporting requirements and test methods; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A schedule for submission of compliance certifications during  the permit term, to be submitted no less frequently than annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any application form, report, or compliance certification  submitted pursuant to these regulations shall contain certification by a  responsible official of truth, accuracy, and completeness.
