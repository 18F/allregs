                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. All bids must state the par amount of securities bid  for and must equal or exceed the minimum to bid amount stated in the  auction announcement. Bids in larger amounts must be in the multiple  stated in the auction announcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Noncompetitive bids--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maximum bid. You may not bid  noncompetitively for more than $5 million. The maximum bid limitation  does not apply if you are bidding solely through either a TreasuryDirect  [supreg] or a Legacy Treasury Direct [supreg] reinvestment request. A  request for reinvestment of securities maturing in either TreasuryDirect  or Legacy Treasury Direct is a noncompetitive bid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional restrictions. You may not bid noncompetitively in an  auction in which you are bidding competitively. You may not bid  noncompetitively if, in the security being auctioned, you hold a  position in when-issued trading or in futures or forward contracts at  any time between the date of the auction announcement and the time we  announce the auction results. During this same timeframe, a  noncompetitive bidder may not enter into any agreement to purchase or  sell or otherwise dispose of the securities it is acquiring in the  auction. For this paragraph, futures contracts include those:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That require delivery of the specific security being auctioned;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For which the security being auctioned is one of several  securities that may be delivered; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That are cash-settled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Competitive bids--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bid format--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Treasury bills. A  competitive bid must show the discount rate bid, expressed with three  decimals in .005 increments. The third decimal must be either a zero or  a five, for example, 5.320 or 5.325. We will treat any missing decimals  as zero, for example, a bid of 5.32 will be treated as 5.320. The rate  bid may be a positive number or zero.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Treasury non-indexed securities. A competitive bid must show  the yield bid, expressed with three decimals, for example, 4.170. We  will treat any missing decimals as zero, for example, a bid of 4.1 will  be treated as 4.100. The yield bid may be a positive number or zero.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Treasury inflation-protected securities. A competitive bid  must show the real yield bid, expressed with three decimals, for  example, 3.070. We will treat any missing decimals as zero, for example,  a bid of 3 will be treated as 3.000. The real yield may be a positive  number, a negative number, or zero.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Treasury floating rate notes. A competitive bid must show the  discount margin bid, expressed as a percentage with three decimals, for  example, 0.290 percent. We will treat any missing decimals as zero, for  example, a bid of 0.29 will be treated as 0.290. The discount margin bid  may be positive, negative, or zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maximum recognized bid. There is no limit on the maximum dollar  amount that you may bid for competitively, either at a single yield,  discount rate, or discount margin, or at different yields, discount  rates, or discount margins. However, a competitive bid at a single  yield, discount rate, or discount margin that exceeds 35 percent of the  offering amount will be reduced to that amount. For example, if the  offering amount is $10 billion, the maximum bid amount we will recognize  at any one yield, discount rate, or discount margin from any bidder is  $3.5 billion. (See Sec. 356.22 for award limitations.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additional restrictions. You may not bid competitively in an  auction in which you are bidding noncompetitively. You may not bid  competitively for securities to be bought through either TreasuryDirect  or Legacy Treasury Direct.
