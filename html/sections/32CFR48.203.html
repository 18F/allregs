                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A member who has completed less than 19 years of service as defined in Sec. 48.102(o) may elect to receive a reduced amount of retired pay in order to provide one or more of the annuities as specified in Secs. 48.201 and 48.202, payable after his death while entitled to retired pay to or on behalf of his surviving widow, child, or children. To be effective, the election by such a member must be dated, signed, witnessed, and delivered to appropriate service officials, or postmarked not later than midnight on the day in which he completes 19 years of service. Such an election will become effective immediately upon subsequent retirement. The latest election, change, or revocation made in accordance with this subsection will, if otherwise valid, be the effective election, unless superseded by a change as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a member who fails or declines to make an election before completion of 19 years of service may make an election after that time. However, unless the election is made at least 2 years prior to the date the member becomes entitled to receive retired pay, it will not be effective. The same applies to subsequent changes or revocations made prior to retirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an election, revocation, or change was made prior to August 13, 1968, the 19-year and 2-year provisions are automatically in effect on August 13, 1968, for members who were not entitled to retired pay on such date, unless the member applies under Sec. 48.604(d) to remain under the provisions of the law prior to August 13, 1968. In this case the ``18 years of service'' and ``3 years prior to receipt of retired pay'' rules will apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A member retired for physical disability on or after November 1, 1968 who is awarded retired pay prior to completion of 19 years of service may make an election which is subject to the restrictions set forth in Sec. 48.507. The election by such member shall be made before the first day for which he is entitled to retired pay. Elections made under this paragraph prior to November 1, 1968, must be made by the member retiring for physical disability prior to completing 18 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If, because of military operations, a member is assigned to an isolated station, or is missing, interned in a neutral country, captured by a hostile force, or beleaguered or besieged, and for that reason is unable to make an election before completing 19 years of service, he may make the election within 1 year after he ceases to be assigned to that station or returns to the jurisdiction of his service as the case may be, and such election shall become effective immediately upon subsequent retirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A member to whom retired pay is granted retroactively, and who is otherwise eligible to make an election, may make the election within 90 days after receiving notice that such pay has been granted him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Whenever a member is determined to be mentally incompetent by medical officers of the uniformed services or of the Veterans Administration, or is adjudged mentally incompetent by a court of competent jurisdiction and because of such mental incompetency is incapable of making any election within the time limitations prescribed by the Plan, the Secretary of the Department concerned may make the appropriate election on behalf of such member upon request of the spouse, or if there be no spouse, by or on behalf of the child or children of such member. If such member is subsequently determined to be mentally competent by the Veterans Administration or a court of competent jurisdiction, he may, within 180 days after such determination or

judgment, change or revoke the election made on his behalf. In such a case, the change or revocation will be effective on the date of the member's request for such change or revocation. Deductions previously made shall not be refunded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> All elections on file on August 13, 1968, for members not entitled to receive retired pay shall be subject to the provisions of this section unless the member makes the application specified in Sec. 48.604(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> A person who was a former member of the armed forces on November 1, 1953, and who is granted retired pay after that date, may, at the time he is granted that pay, make an election as provided in Sec. 48.201.</p>
