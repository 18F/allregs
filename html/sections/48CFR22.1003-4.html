These will be made only in special circumstances where it has been  determined that the limitation, variation, tolerance, or exemption is  necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid the serious  impairment of Government business, and is in accord with the remedial  purpose of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute to protect  prevailing labor standards (41 U.S.C. 6707(b)). See 29 CFR 4.123 for a  listing of administrative exemptions, tolerances, and variations.  Requests for limitations, variances, tolerances, and exemptions from the  Service Contract Labor Standards statute shall be submitted in writing  through contracting channels and the agency labor advisor to the Wage  and Hour Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the statutory exemptions cited in 22.1003-3 of  this subsection, the Secretary of Labor has exempted the following types  of contracts from all provisions of the Service Contract Labor Standards  statute:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contracts entered into by the United States with common carriers  for the carriage of mail by rail, air (except air star routes), bus, and  ocean vessel, where such carriage is performed on regularly scheduled  runs of the trains, airplanes, buses, and vessels over regularly  established routes and accounts for an insubstantial portion of the  revenue therefrom.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any contract entered into by the U.S. Postal Service with an  individual owner-operator for mail service if it is not contemplated at  the time the contract is made that the owner-operator will hire any  service employee to perform the services under the contract except for  short periods of vacation time or for unexpected contingencies or  emergency situations such as illness, or accident.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Contracts for the carriage of freight or personnel if such  carriage is   subject to rates covered by section 10721 of the Interstate Commerce  Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Contracts for maintenance, calibration or repair of certain  equipment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exemption. The Secretary of Labor has exempted from the  Service Contract Labor Standards statute contracts and subcontracts in  which the primary purpose is to furnish maintenance, calibration, or  repair of the following types of equipment, if the conditions at  paragraph (c)(2) of this subsection are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Automated data processing equipment and office information/word  processing systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Scientific equipment and medical apparatus or equipment if the  application of micro-electronic circuitry or other technology of at  least similar sophistication is an essential element (for example,  Product or Service Code (PSC) 6515, ``Medical and Surgical Instruments,  Equipment, and Supplies;'' PSC 6525, ``Imaging Equipment and Supplies:  Medical, Dental, Veterinary;'' PSC 6630, ``Chemical Analysis  Instruments;'' and PSC 6655, ``Geophysical Instruments,'' are largely  composed of the types of equipment exempted in this paragraph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Office/business machines not otherwise exempt pursuant to  paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this subsection, if such services are performed  by the manufacturer or supplier of the equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Conditions.
