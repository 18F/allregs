The term does not apply,  however, to a contrivance packed together with its means of initiation,  provided the device is packaged so as to eliminate the risk of causing  detonation of the contrivance in the event of functioning of the  initiating device. The initiating device can even be assembled in the  contrivance provided there are protective features ensuring that the  device is very unlikely to cause detonation of the contrivance under  conditions which are associated with transport.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> For the purposes of classification, any means of initiation  without two effective protective features should be regarded as  Compatibility Group B; an article with its own means of initiation,  without two effective protective features, is Compatibility Group F. A  means of initiation which itself possesses two effective protective  features is Compatibility Group D, and an article with its own means of  initiation which possesses two effective features is Compatibility Group  D or E. A means of initiation, adjudged as having two effective  protective features, must be approved by the Associate Administrator. A  common and effective way of achieving the necessary degree of protection  is to use a means of initiation which incorporates two or more  independent safety features.</p><p class="depth2">Jet perforating guns, charged, oil well, without detonator. Articles  consisting of a steel tube or metallic strip, into which are inserted  shaped charges connected by detonating cord, without means of  initiation.</p><p class="depth2">Lighters, fuse.

Explosion which affects almost the entire load  virtually instantaneously.</p><p class="depth2">Mines. Articles consisting normally of metal or composition  receptacles and bursting charge. They are designed to be operated by the  passage of ships, vehicles, or personnel. The term includes Bangalore  torpedoes.</p><p class="depth2">Phlegmatized. The term means that a substance (or ``phlegmatizer'')  has been added to an explosive to enhance its safety in handling and  transport. The phlegmatizer renders the explosive insensitive, or less  sensitive, to the following actions: heat, shock, impact, percussion or  friction. Typical phlegmatizing agents include, but are not limited to:  wax, paper, water, polymers (such as chlorofluoropolymers), alcohol and  oils (such as petroleum jelly and paraffin).</p><p class="depth2">Powder cake (powder paste).
