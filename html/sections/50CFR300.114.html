                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A dealer intending to import or re-export AMLR must  obtain an AMLR dealer permit valid for one year. Preapproval from NMFS  is required for each shipment of frozen Dissostichus species. The permit  holder may only conduct those specific activities stipulated by the  permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An AMLR may be imported into the United States if its harvest  has been authorized by a U.S.-issued individual permit issued under  Sec. 300.112(a)(1) or its importation has been authorized by a NMFS- issued dealer permit and preapproval issued under Sec. 300.114(a)(1).  AMLRs may not be released for entry into the United States unless  accompanied by the harvesting permit or the individual permit or dealer  permit and, in the case of frozen Dissostichus species, the preapproval  certification granted by NMFS to allow import. NMFS will only accept  electronic catch documents for toothfish imports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In no event may a marine mammal be imported into the United  States unless authorized and accompanied by an import permit issued  under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and/or the Endangered Species  Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A dealer permit or preapproval issued under this section does  not authorize the harvest or transshipment of any AMLR by or to a vessel  of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. Application forms for AMLR dealer permits and  preapproval are available from NMFS. With the exception of the U.S.  Customs 7501 entry number, a complete and accurate application must be  received by NMFS for each preapproval at least 15 working days before  the anticipated date of the first receipt, importation, or re-export.  Dealers must supply the U.S. Customs 7501 entry number at least three  working days prior to a Dissostichus species shipment's arrival.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fees. A fee to recover the administrative expenses associated  with processing preapproval applications will be charged. The amount of  the fee will be determined in accordance with procedures specified in  the NOAA Finance Handbook for calculating administrative costs of  special products and services. The fee is specified with the preapproval  application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application  and be paid by check, draft, or money order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Issuance. NMFS may issue a dealer permit or preapproval if it  determines that the activity proposed by the dealer meets the  requirements of the Act and that the resources were not or will not be  harvested in violation of any CCAMLR conservation measure or in  violation of any regulation in this subpart. No preapproval will be  issued for Dissostichus species without verifiable documentation, to  include VMS reports with vessel location and messages, of the use of  real-time C-VMS port-to-port by the vessel that harvested such  Dissostichus species, except for Dissostichus species harvested during  fishing trips that began prior to September 24, 2007.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Duration. A permit issued under this section is valid from its  date of issuance to its date of expiration unless it is revoked or  suspended. A preapproval is valid until the product is imported (and re- exported, if applicable).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transfer. A permit issued under this section is not transferable  or assignable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Changes in information--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pending applications. Applicants for  permits and preapproval under this section must report in writing to  NMFS any change in the information submitted in their permit and  preapproval applications. The processing period for the application may  be extended as necessary to review and consider the change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Issued permits and preapprovals. Any entity issued a permit or  preapproval under this section must report in writing to NMFS any  changes in previously submitted information. Any changes that would  result in a change in the receipt or importation authorized by the  preapproval, such as harvesting vessel or country of origin, type and  quantity of the resource to be received or imported, and Convention  statistical subarea from which the resource was harvested, must be  proposed in writing to NMFS and may not be undertaken unless authorized  by NMFS through issuance of a revised or new preapproval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Revision, suspension, or revocation. A permit or preapproval  issued under this section may be revised, suspended, or revoked, based  upon a violation of the permit, the Act, or this subpart. Failure to  report a change in the information contained in a permit or preapproval  application voids the application, permit, or preapproval as applicable.  Title 15 CFR part 904 governs permit sanctions under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Exception. Preapproval is not required for shipments of fresh  Dissostichus species. A report of a shipment of fresh Dissostichus  species must be completed and submitted to NMFS within 24 hours  following import.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> SVDCD. Dealer permits will not be issued for Dissostichus spp.  offered for sale or other disposition under a Specially Validated DCD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Registered agent. Foreign entities shall, as a condition of  possessing a dealer permit, designate and maintain a registered agent  within the United States that is authorized to accept service of process  on behalf of that entity. Foreign based importers of record may identify  to NMFS the registered agent identified for Customs Service purposes.  [68 FR 23228, May 1, 2003. Redesignated and amended at 72 FR 48510,  48511, Aug. 23, 2007; 75 FR 18112, Apr. 9, 2010]</p>
