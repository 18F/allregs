                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Within 60 days after the date of filing of a petition,  a certifying officer shall make a determination on the petition. If,  however, for any reason, a certifying officer has not made a  determination in 60 days after the date of filing of the petition, the  certifying officer shall make the determination   as soon thereafter as possible. If the determination is affirmative, the  certifying officer shall issue a certification of eligibility as  provided in paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (g) of this section. If the  determination is negative, the certifying officer shall issue a notice  of negative determination as provided in paragraphs (b) and (f) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements for determinations. After reviewing the relevant  information necessary to make a determination, the certifying officer  shall make findings of fact concerning whether:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A significant number or proportion of the workers in such  workers' firm (or an appropriate subdivision of the firm) have become,  or are threatened to become, totally or partially separated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have  decreased absolutely; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Increases (absolute or relative) of imports of articles like or  directly competitive with articles produced by such workers' firm or an  appropriate subdivision thereof contributed importantly to such total or  partial separation, or threat thereof, and to such decline in sales or  production. For purposes of this paragraph and part, the term  contributed importantly means a cause which is important but not  necessarily more important than any other cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of affirmative determination and certification of  eligibility. Upon reaching a determination on a petition that a group of  workers has met all the requirements set forth in section 222 of the Act  and paragraph (b) of this section, the certifying officer shall issue a  certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance and  shall promptly publish in the Federal Register a summary of the  determination together with the reasons for making such determination  (with the exception of information which the certifying officer  determines to be confidential). Such summary shall include the  certification of eligibility and shall constitute a Notice of  Determination and Certification of Eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contents of certification of eligibility. The certification  shall specify in detail:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The firm or subdivision thereof at which the workers covered by  the certification have been employed (which need not be limited to the  unit specified in the petition), and may identify individual workers by  name; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The impact date(s) on which the total or partial separations of  the workers covered by the certification began or threatened to begin.  When applicable, the certification shall specify the date(s) after which  the total or partial separations of the petitioning group of workers  from the firm or subdivision thereof specified in the certification are  no longer attributable to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of  this section. For purposes of this section, the impact date is the  earliest date on which any part of the total or partial separations  involving a significant number or proportion of workers began or  threatened to begin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exclusions from coverage of a certification of eligibility. A  certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance shall  not apply to any worker:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> year before the date  of the petition; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whose last total or partial separation from the firm or  appropriate subdivision occurred before October 3, 1974.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice of negative determination. Upon reaching a determination  that a group of workers has not met all the requirements set forth in  section 222 of the Act and paragraph (b) of this section, the certifying  officer shall promptly publish in the Federal Register a summary of the  determination together with the reasons for making such determinations  (with the exception of information which the certifying officer  determines to be confidential). Such summary shall constitute a Notice  of Negative Determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of Determinations. A notice of certification may contain  a notice of negative determination with respect to certain segments of  workers. Such notice shall constitute a Notice of Determinations.  [42 FR 32772, June 28, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 23402, June 19, 1987]</p>
