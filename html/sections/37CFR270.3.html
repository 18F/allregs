                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section prescribes rules under which nonsubscription transmission services, preexisting satellite digital audio radio services, new subscription services, and business establishment services shall maintain reports of use of their sound recordings under section 112(e) or section 114(d)(2) of title 17 of the United States Code, or both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. (1) Aggregate Tuning Hours are the total hours of programming that a nonsubscription transmission service, preexisting satellite digital audio radio service, new subscription service or business establishment service has transmitted during the reporting period identified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section to all listeners within the United States over the relevant channels or stations, and from any archived programs, that provide audio programming consisting, in whole or in part, of eligible nonsubscription service, preexisting satellite digital audio radio service, new subscription service or business establishment service transmissions, less the actual running time of any sound recordings for which the service has obtained direct licenses apart from 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(2) or which do not require a license under United States copyright law. For example, if a nonsubscription transmission service transmitted one hour of programming to 10 simultaneous listeners, the nonsubscription transmission service's Aggregate Tuning Hours would equal 10. If 3 minutes of that hour consisted of transmission of a directly licensed recording, the nonsubscription transmission service's Aggregate Tuning Hours would equal 9 hours and 30 minutes. If one listener listened to the transmission of a nonsubscription transmission service for 10 hours (and none of the recordings transmitted during that time was directly licensed), the nonsubscription transmission service's Aggregate Tuning Hours would equal 10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Aggregate Tuning Hours are the total hours of programming that a nonsubscription transmission service, preexisting satellite digital audio radio service, new subscription service or business establishment service has transmitted during the reporting period identified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section to all listeners within the United States over the relevant channels or stations, and from any archived programs, that provide audio programming consisting, in whole or in part, of eligible nonsubscription service, preexisting satellite digital audio radio service, new subscription service or business establishment service transmissions, less the actual running time of any sound recordings for which the service has obtained direct licenses apart from 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(2) or which do not require a license under United States copyright law.

If one listener listened to the transmission of a nonsubscription transmission service for 10 hours (and none of the recordings transmitted during that time was directly licensed), the nonsubscription transmission service's Aggregate Tuning Hours would equal 10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An AM/FM Webcast is a transmission made by an entity that transmits an AM/FM broadcast signal over a digital communications network such as the Internet, regardless of whether the transmission is made by the broadcaster that originates the AM/FM signal or by a third party, provided that such transmission meets the applicable requirements of the statutory license set forth in 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A Collective is a collection and distribution organization that is designated under one or both of the statutory licenses, either by settlement agreement reached under section 112(e)(3), section 112(e)(6), section 114(f)(1)(A), section 114(f)(1)(C)(i), section 114(f)(2)(A), or section 114(f)(2)(C)(i) and adopted pursuant to Sec.  251.63(b) of this chapter, or by a decision of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel under section 112(e)(4), section 112(e)(6), section 114(f)(1)(B), section (f)(1)(C)(ii), section 114(f)(2)(B), or section 114(f)(2)(C)(ii) or by order of the Librarian of Congress pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 802(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A new subscription service is defined in Sec.  270.1(b)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A nonsubscription transmission service is defined in Sec.  270.1(b)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A preexisting satellite digital audio radio service is defined in Sec.  270.1(b)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A business establishment service is defined in Sec.  270.1(b)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A performance is each instance in which any portion of a sound recording is publicly performed to a Listener by means of a digital audio transmission or retransmission (e.g., the delivery of any portion of a single track from a compact disc to one Listener) but excluding the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A performance of a sound recording that does not require a license (e.g., the sound recording is not copyrighted);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A performance of a sound recording for which the service has previously obtained a license from the Copyright Owner of such sound recording; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An incidental performance that both:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Makes no more than incidental use of sound recordings including, but not limited to, brief musical transitions in and out of commercials or program segments, brief performances during news, talk and sports programming, brief background performances during disk jockey announcements, brief performances during commercials of sixty seconds or less in duration, or brief performances during sporting or other public events and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Other than ambient music that is background at a public event, does not contain an entire sound recording and does not feature a particular sound recording of more than thirty seconds (as in the case of a sound recording used as a theme song).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Play frequency is the number of times a sound recording is publicly performed by a Service during the relevant period, without respect to the number of listeners receiving the sound recording. If a particular sound recording is transmitted to listeners on a particular channel or program only once during the two-week reporting period, then the play frequency is one. If the sound recording is transmitted 10 times during the two-week reporting period, then the play frequency is 10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A Report of Use is a report required under this section to be provided by a nonsubscription transmission service and new subscription service that is transmitting sound recordings pursuant to the statutory license set forth in section 114(d)(2) of title 17 of the United States Code or making ephemeral phonorecords of sound recordings pursuant to the statutory license set forth in section 112(e) of title 17 of the United States Code, or both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Report of Use--(1) Separate reports not required. A nonsubscription transmission service, preexisting satellite digital audio radio service or a new subscription service that transmits sound recordings pursuant to the statutory license set forth in section 114(d)(2) of title 17 of the United States Code and makes ephemeral phonorecords of sound recordings pursuant to the statutory license set forth in section 112(e) of title 17 of the United States Code need not maintain a separate Report of Use for each statutory license during the relevant reporting periods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Separate reports not required.
