                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. VA will not pay benefits to an individual for a course  from which the individual withdraws or receives a nonpunitive grade  which is not used in computing the requirements for graduation unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The individual withdraws because he or she is ordered to active  duty; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All of the following criteria are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There are mitigating circumstances;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The individual submits a description of the circumstances in  writing to VA either within one year from the date VA notifies the  individual that he or she must submit the mitigating circumstances or at  a later date if the individual is able to show good cause why the one- year time limit should be extended to the date on which he or she  submitted the description of the mitigating circumstances; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The individual submits evidence supporting the existence of  mitigating circumstances within one year of the date that evidence is  requested by VA, or at a later date if the individual is able to show  good cause why the one-year time limit should be extended to the date on  which he or she submitted the evidence supporting the existence of  mitigating circumstances.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3680(a))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Representative mitigating circumstances. The following  circumstances, which are not all inclusive, are representative of those  that VA considers to be mitigating provided they prevent the individual  from pursuing the program of education continuously:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An illness of the individual;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An illness or death in the individual's family;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An unavoidable geographical transfer resulting from the  individual's employment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An unavoidable change in the individual's conditions of  employment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Immediate family or financial obligations beyond the control of  the individual that require him or her to suspend pursuit of the program  of education to obtain employment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Discontinuance of the course by the school;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Unanticipated active duty for training;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Unanticipated difficulties in caring for the individual's child  or children.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3680(a))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to complete a course for the educationally  disadvantaged. If the individual fails to satisfactorily complete a  course under 38 U.S.C. 3491(a) without fault, VA will consider the  circumstances that caused the failure to be mitigating. This will be the  case even if the circumstances were not so severe as to preclude  continuous pursuit of a program of education.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Withdrawals after May 31, 1989. In the first instance of a  withdrawal after May 31, 1989, from a course or courses for which the  individual received educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 32,  VA will consider that mitigating circumstances exist with respect to  courses totaling not more than six semester hours or the equivalent, and  paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section will not apply.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3680(a)(3))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Withdrawals during a drop-add period. If the individual  withdraws from a course during a drop-add period, VA will consider the  circumstances that caused the withdrawal to be mitigating, and  paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section will not apply.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3680(a))  [31 FR 8292, June 14, 1966]</p><p class="depth2">Editorial Note: For Federal Register citations affecting Sec.  21.4136, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the  Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at www.fdsys.gov.</p>
