An answer should be responsive to the complaint and should fully advise the Board and the parties of the nature of the defense.

In response to a complaint filed under the simplified standards, the answer must include the defendant's preliminary estimate of the variable cost of each challenged movement calculated using the unadjusted figures produced by the URCS Phase III program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disclosure with simplified standards answer. The defendant must provide to the complainant all documents that it

relied upon to determine the inputs used in the URCS Phase III program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time for filing; copies; service. An answer must be filed within 20 days after the service of the complaint or within such additional time as the Board may provide. The original and 10 copies of an answer must be filed with the Board.

A cross complaint alleging violations by other parties to the proceeding or seeking relief against them may be filed with the answer. An answer to a cross complaint shall be filed within 20 days after the service date of the cross complaint. The party shall serve copies of an answer to a cross complaint upon the other parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to answer complaint. Averments in a complaint are admitted when not denied in an answer to the complaint.
