                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Principle. Covered services furnished after September 30, 1978  by organ procurement organizations (OPOs) and histocompatibility  laboratories in connection with kidney acquisition and transplantation  will be reimbursed under the principles for determining reasonable cost  contained in this part. Services furnished by freestanding OPOs and  histocompatibility laboratories, that have an agreement with the  Secretary in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, will be  reimbursed by making an interim payment to the transplant hospitals  using these services and by making a retroactive adjustment, directly  with the OPO or laboratory, based upon a cost report filed by the OPO or  laboratory. (The reasonable costs of services furnished by hospital  based OPOs or laboratories will be reimbursed in accordance with the  principles contained in Sec. Sec. 413.60 and 413.64.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Freestanding refers to an OPO or a histocompatibility laboratory  that is not--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Subject to the control of the hospital with respect to the  hiring, firing, training, and paying of employees; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Considered as a department of the hospital for insurance  purposes (including malpractice insurance, general liability insurance,  worker's compensation insurance, and employee retirement insurance).</p><p class="depth0">Histocompatibility laboratory means a laboratory meeting the  standards and providing the services for kidneys or other organs set  forth in Sec. 413.2171(d) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">OPO means an organization defined in Sec. 486.302 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Agreements with independent OPOs and laboratories. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any  freestanding OPO or histocompatibility laboratory that wishes to have  the cost of its pretransplant services reimbursed under the Medicare  program must file an agreement with CMS under which the OPO or  laboratory agrees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To file a cost report in accordance with Sec. 413.24(f) within  three months after the end of each fiscal year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To permit CMS to designate an contractor to determine the  interim reimbursement rate payable to the transplant hospitals for  services provided by the OPO or laboratory and to make a determination  of reasonable cost based upon the cost report filed by the OPO or  laboratory;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To provide such budget or cost projection information as may  be required to establish an initial interim reimbursement rate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> To pay to CMS amounts that have been paid by CMS to transplant  hospitals and that are determined to be in excess of the reasonable cost  of the services provided by the OPO or laboratory; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Not to charge any individual for items or services for which  that individual is entitled to have payment made under section 1861 of  the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section. The  initial cost report covers only the period covered by the agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Interim reimbursement. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Hospitals eligible to receive  Medicare reimbursement for renal transplantation will be paid for the  pretransplantation services of a freestanding OPO or histocompatibility  laboratory that has an agreement with the Secretary under paragraph (c)  of this section, on the basis of an interim rate established by an  contractor for that OPO or laboratory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The interim rate will be based on the average cost per service  incurred by an OPO or laboratory, during its previous fiscal year,  associated with procuring a kidney for transplantation. This interim  rate may be adjusted if necessary for anticipated cost changes.   If there is not adequate cost data to determine the initial interim  rate, it will be determined according to the OPO's or laboratory's  estimate of its projected costs for the fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payments made on the basis of the interim rate will be  reconciled directly with the OPO or laboratory after the close of its  fiscal year, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Information on the interim rate for all freestanding OPOs and  histocompatibility laboratories shall be disseminated to all transplant  hospitals and contractors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Retroactive adjustment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cost reports. Information provided  in cost reports by freestanding OPOs and histocompatibility laboratories  must meet the requirements for cost data and cost finding specified in  paragraphs (a) through (e) of Sec. 413.24. These cost reports must  provide a complete accounting of the cost incurred by the agency or  laboratory in providing covered services, the total number of Medicare  beneficiaries who received those services, and any other data necessary  to enable the contractor to make a determination of the reasonable cost  of covered services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Audit and adjustment. A cost report submitted by a freestanding  OPO or histocompatibility laboratory will be reviewed by the contractor  and a new interim reimbursement rate for the succeeding fiscal year will  be established based upon this review. A retroactive adjustment in the  amount paid under the interim rate will be made in accordance with Sec.  413.64(f). If the determination of reasonable cost reveals an  overpayment or underpayment resulting from the interim reimbursement  rate paid to transplant hospitals, a lump sum adjustment will be made  directly between that contractor and the OPO or laboratory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> For services furnished on or after April 1, 1988, no payment may  be made for services furnished by an OPO that does not meet the  requirements of part 486, subpart G of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Appeals. Any OPO or histocompatibility laboratory that disagrees  with a contractor's cost determination under this section is entitled to  an contractor hearing, in accordance with the procedures contained in  Sec. Sec. 405.1811 through 405.1833, if the amount in controversy is  $1,000 or more.  [62 FR 43668, Aug. 15, 1997, as amended at 71 FR 31046, May 31, 2006]</p>
