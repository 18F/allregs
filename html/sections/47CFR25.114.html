An application for blanket authority for  an NGSO satellite constellation comprised of space stations that are not  all technically identical must provide the information required by  paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section for each type of space station in  the constellation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each application for a new or modified space station  authorization must constitute a concrete proposal for Commission  evaluation. Each application must also contain the formal waiver  required by section 304 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 304. The  technical information for a proposed satellite system specified in  paragraph (c) of this section must be filed on FCC Form 312, Main Form  and Schedule S. The technical information for a proposed satellite  system specified in paragraph (d) of this section need not be filed on  any prescribed form but should be complete in all pertinent details.  Applications for all new space station authorizations must be filed  electronically through the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS) in  accordance with the applicable provisions of part 1, subpart Y of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following information shall be filed on FCC Form 312, Main  Form and Schedule S:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name, address, and telephone number of the person(s), including  counsel, to whom inquiries or correspondence should be directed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Type of authorization requested (e.g., launch authority, station  license, modification of authorization);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For each space station transmitting and receiving antenna  beam (including telemetry and tracking beams but not command beams),  specify channel center frequencies and bandwidths and polarization plan.  For command beams, specify each of the center frequencies within a 5 MHz   range or a range of 2 percent of the assigned bandwidth, whichever is  smaller, and the polarization plan. If the space station can vary  channel bandwidth in a particular frequency band with on-board  processing, specify only the range of frequencies in that band over  which the beam can operate and the polarization plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specify maximum EIRP and maximum EIRP density for each space  station transmitting antenna beam. If the satellite uses shapeable  antenna beams, as defined in Sec. 25.103, specify instead maximum  possible EIRP and maximum possible EIRP density within each shapeable  beam's proposed coverage area. Provide this information for each  frequency band in which the transmitting antenna would operate. For  bands below 15 GHz, specify EIRP density in dBW/4 kHz; for bands at and  above 15 GHz, specify EIRP density in dBW/MHz. If the EIRP density  varies over time, specify the maximum possible EIRP density.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)-(iv)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For each space station receiving beam other than command beams,  specify the gain-to-temperature ratio at beam peak. For receiving beams  fed into transponders, also specify the minimum and maximum saturation  flux density at beam peak. If the satellite uses shapeable beams,  specify the minimum and maximum gain-to-temperature ratio within each  shapeable beam's proposed coverage area, and for shapeable receiving  beams fed into transponders, specify the minimum and maximum saturation  power flux density within the 0 dB relative antenna gain isoline.  Provide this information for each frequency band in which the receiving  beam can operate. For command beams, specify the beam peak flux density  at the command threshold;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For space stations in geostationary orbit, specify predicted  space station antenna gain contour(s) for each transmit and receive  antenna beam, except for beams where the contour at 8 dB below peak  falls entirely beyond the edge of the visible Earth. These contour(s)  should be plotted on an area map at 2 dB intervals down to 10 dB below  the peak gain and at 5 dB intervals between 10 dB and 20 dB below the  peak gain. Applicants must present this information in a GIMS-readable  format.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For space stations in non-geostationary orbits, specify for each  unique orbital plane the predicted antenna gain contour(s) for each  transmit and receive antenna beam for one space station if all space  stations are identical in the constellation. If individual space  stations in the constellation have different antenna beam  configurations, specify the predicted antenna gain contours for each  transmit and receive beam for each space station type and orbit or  orbital plane requested. The contours should be plotted on an area map  with the beam depicted on the surface of the earth with the space  stations' peak antenna gain pointed at nadir to a latitude and longitude  within the proposed service area. The contour(s) should be plotted at 2  dB intervals down to 10 dB below the peak gain and at 5 dB intervals  between 10 dB and 20 dB below the peak gain.

If the  shapeable beams are also steerable, include the contours that would  result from moving the beam peak around the limit of the effective beam  peak area and the 0 dB relative antenna gain isoline. The proposed  maximum coverage area must be clearly specified.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> For space stations with steerable beams that are not shapeable,  specify the applicable contours, as defined in paragraph(c)(4)(vi)(A) or  (B) of this section, with a description of the area that the steerable  beam(s) is expected to serve, or provide the contour information  described in paragraph (c)(4)(vi)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> For geostationary satellites with large numbers of identical  fixed spot beams, other than DBS satellites,   applicants may, as an alternative to submitting the information  described in paragraph (c)(4)(vi) of this section with respect to these  beams, provide the predicted antenna gain contours for one transmit and  receive antenna beam, together with one of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An area map showing all of the spot beams depicted on the  surface of the Earth;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A table identifying the maximum antenna gain point(s) in  latitude and longitude to the nearest 0.1 degree; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A map of the isolines formed by combining all of the spot beams  into one or more composite beams. For non-geostationary satellites with  large numbers of identical fixed beams on each satellite, applicants  may, as an alternative to submitting the information described in  paragraph (c)(4)(vi) of this section with respect to those beams,  specify the predicted antenna gain contours for one transmit and receive  beam pointed to nadir, together with an area map showing all of the spot  beams depicted on the surface of the earth with the satellites' peak  antenna gain pointed to a selected latitude and longitude within the  service area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For space stations in geostationary orbit:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Orbital location requested,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> East-west station-keeping range,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> North-south station-keeping range, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Accuracy to which antenna axis attitude will be maintained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For space stations in non-geostationary orbits:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The number of orbital planes and the number of space stations in  each plane,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The inclination of the orbital plane(s),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The orbital period,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The apogee,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The perigee,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The argument(s) of perigee,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Active service arc(s),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Right ascension of the ascending node(s), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> For each satellite in each orbital plane, the initial phase  angle at the reference time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The frequency bands, types of service, and coverage areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Calculated maximum power flux density levels within each  coverage area and energy dispersal bandwidths, if any, needed for  compliance with Sec. 25.208, for the angles of arrival specified in the  applicable paragraph(s) of Sec. 25.208;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Estimated operational lifetime;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Whether the space station is to be operated on a common carrier  basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> The polarization information necessary for determining  compliance with Sec. 25.210(a)(1), (a)(3), and (i);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following information in narrative form shall be contained  in each application:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Overall description of system facilities, operations and  services and explanation of how uplink frequency bands would be  connected to downlink frequency bands;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)-(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Public interest considerations in support of grant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Applicants for authorizations for space stations in the Fixed- Satellite Service must also include the information specified in Sec.  25.140(a).

Further, applicants must provide sufficient technical  showing that the proposed system could operate satisfactorily if all  assignments in the BSS and feeder link Plans were implemented.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Analyses of the proposed system with respect to the limits in  Annex 1 to Appendices 30 and 30A of the ITU Radio Regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> A description of the design and operational strategies that  will be used to mitigate orbital debris, including the following  information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement that the space station operator has assessed and  limited the amount of debris released in a planned manner during normal  operations, and has assessed and limited the probability of the space  station becoming a source of debris by collisions with small debris or  meteoroids that could cause loss of control and prevent post-mission  disposal;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement that the space station operator has assessed and  limited the probability of accidental explosions during and after  completion of mission operations. This statement must include a  demonstration that debris generation will not result from the conversion  of energy sources on board the spacecraft into energy that fragments the  spacecraft. Energy sources include chemical, pressure, and kinetic  energy. This demonstration should address whether stored energy will be  removed at the spacecraft's end of life, by depleting residual fuel and  leaving all fuel line valves open, venting any pressurized system,  leaving all batteries in a permanent discharge state, and removing any  remaining source of stored energy, or through other equivalent  procedures specifically disclosed in the application;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement that the space station operator has assessed and  limited the probability of the space station becoming a source of debris  by collisions with large debris or other operational space stations.  Where a space station will be launched into a low-Earth orbit that is  identical, or very similar, to an orbit used by other space stations,  the statement must include an analysis of the potential risk of  collision and a description of what measures the space station operator  plans to take to avoid in-orbit collisions. If the space station  operator is relying on coordination with another system, the statement  must indicate what steps have been taken to contact, and ascertain the  likelihood of successful coordination of physical operations with, the  other system. The statement must disclose the accuracy--if any--with  which orbital parameters of non-geostationary satellite orbit space  stations will be maintained, including apogee, perigee, inclination, and  the right ascension of the ascending node(s). In the event that a system  is not able to maintain orbital tolerances, i.e., it lacks a propulsion  system for orbital maintenance, that fact should be included in the  debris mitigation disclosure. Such systems must also indicate the  anticipated evolution over time of the orbit of the proposed satellite  or satellites. Where a space station requests the assignment of a  geostationary-Earth orbit location, it must assess whether there are any  known satellites located at, or reasonably expected to be located at,  the requested orbital location, or assigned in the vicinity of that  location, such that the station keeping volumes of the respective  satellites might overlap. If so, the statement must include a statement  as to the identities of those parties and the measures that will be  taken to prevent collisions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement detailing the post-mission disposal plans for the  space station at end of life, including the quantity of fuel--if any-- that will be reserved for post-mission disposal maneuvers. For  geostationary-Earth orbit space stations, the statement must disclose  the altitude selected for a post-mission disposal orbit and the  calculations that are used in deriving the disposal altitude. The  statement must also include a casualty risk assessment if planned post- mission disposal involves atmospheric re-entry of the space station. In  general, an assessment should include an estimate as to whether portions  of the spacecraft will survive re-entry and reach the surface of the  Earth, as well as an estimate of the resulting probability of human  casualty. Applicants for space stations to be used only for commercial  remote sensing may, in lieu of submitting detailed post-mission disposal  plans to the Commission, certify that they have submitted such plans to  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for review.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For non-U.S.-licensed space stations, the requirement to  describe the design and operational strategies to minimize orbital  debris risk can be satisfied by demonstrating that debris mitigation  plans for the space station(s) for which U.S. market access is requested  are subject to direct and effective regulatory oversight by the national  licensing authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Each applicant for a space station license in the 17/24 GHz  broadcasting-satellite service shall include the following information  as an attachment to its application:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as set forth in paragraph (d)(15)(ii) of this section, an  applicant proposing to operate in the 17.3-17.7 GHz frequency band, must  provide a demonstration that the proposed space station will comply with  the power flux density limits set forth in Sec. 25.208(w) of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In cases where the proposed space station will not comply with  the power flux density limits set forth in Sec. 25.208(w) of this part,  the applicant will be required to provide a certification that all  potentially affected parties acknowledge and do not object to the use of  the applicant's higher power flux densities.
