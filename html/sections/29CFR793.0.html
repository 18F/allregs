                            <p class="depth0">This part 793 constitutes the official interpretative bulletin of  the Department of Labor with respect to the meaning and application of  section 13(b)(9) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.  This section provides an exemption from the overtime pay provisions of  the Act for certain employees employed by certain small market radio and  television stations. This exemption was added to the Act by the 1961  amendments. It is the purpose of this bulletin to make available in one  place the interpretations of the provisions in section 13(b) (9) which  will guide the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator in the  performance of their duties under the Act unless and until they are  otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the courts or conclude,  upon re-examination of an interpretation, that it is incorrect.</p>
