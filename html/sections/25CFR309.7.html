                            <p class="depth0">The Indian Arts and Crafts Act is a truth-in-marketing law. Those who produce and market art and craft work should honestly represent and clarify the degree of Indian involvement in the production of the art and craft work when it is sold, displayed or offered for sale. The following guidelines illustrate the way in which art and craft work may be characterized for marketing purposes and gives examples of products that may be marketed as Indian products.
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An Indian conceives, designs, and       it is an ``Indian product.''</p><p class="depth2">makes the art or craft work.(b) An Indian produces a product that is    it can be marketed as such</p><p class="depth2">``handcrafted,'' as explained in            and it meets the definition</p><p class="depth2">309.3(d)(iii).                              of ``Indian product.''(c) An Indian makes an art or craft work    it is ``Indian made'' and</p><p class="depth2">using some machine made parts.              meets the definition of</p><p class="depth2">``Indian product.''(d) An Indian designs a product, such as a  it does not meet the</p><p class="depth2">bracelet, which is then produced by non-    definition of ``Indian</p><p class="depth2">Indians.                                    product'' under the Act.(e) A product, such as jewelry, is made     it does not meet the</p><p class="depth2">with non-artistic Indian labor, from        definition of ``Indian</p><p class="depth2">assembled or ``fit together parts''.        product'' under the Act.</p><p class="depth2">\1\(f) A product in the style of an Indian     it does not meet the</p><p class="depth2">product is assembled by non-Indian labor    definition of ``Indian</p><p class="depth2">from a kit.                                 product'' under the Act.(g) A product is in the style of an Indian  it does not meet the</p><p class="depth2">art or craft product, but not made by an    definition of ``Indian</p><p class="depth2">Indian.                                     product'' under the Act.(h) An Indian and a non-Indian jointly      less than all of the labor</p><p class="depth2">undertake the art or craft work to          is Indian and hence it does</p><p class="depth2">produce an art or craft product, for        not meet the definition of</p><p class="depth2">example a concho belt.                      ``Indian product'' under</p><p class="depth2">the Act. \2\------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ For example, a necklace strung with overseas manufactured fetishes</p><p class="depth2">or heshi. If an Indian assembled the necklace, in keeping with the</p><p class="depth2">truth-in-marketing focus of the Act, it can be marketed as ``Indian</p><p class="depth2">assembled.'' It does not meet the definition of ``Indian product''</p><p class="depth2">under the Act. Similarly, if a product, such as a dream catcher is</p><p class="depth2">assembled by an Indian from a kit, it can be marketed as ``Indian</p><p class="depth2">assembled.'' It does not meet the definition of ``Indian product''</p><p class="depth2">under the Act.\2\ In order to be an ``Indian product,'' the labor component of the</p><p class="depth2">product must be entirely Indian. In keeping with this truth-in-</p><p class="depth2">marketing law, a collaborative work should be marketed as such.</p><p class="depth2">Therefore, it should be marketed as produced by ``X'' (name of artist</p><p class="depth2">or artisan), ``Y'' (Tribe of individual's enrollment) or (name of</p><p class="depth2">Tribe providing official written certification the individual is a non-</p><p class="depth2">member Indian artisan and date upon which such certification was</p><p class="depth2">issued by the Tribe), and ``Z'' (name of artist or artisan with no</p><p class="depth2">Tribe listed) to avoid providing false suggestions to consumers.
