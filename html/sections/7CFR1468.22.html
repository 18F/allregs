Conservation practices installed before the execution of a CFO contract, but needed in the contract to obtain the environmental benefits agreed upon, are to be operated and maintained as specified in the contract. NRCS may periodically inspect the conservation practice during the lifespan of the practice as specified in the contract to ensure that the operation and maintenance is occurring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For those persons who are signatories to existing CRP or EQIP contracts, or WRP cost-share agreements, practices will be transferred from EQIP and CRP contracts or WRP cost-share agreements, as agreed upon in the CFO conservation farm plan and CFO contract. Remaining rights and obligations under CRP, EQIP, or WRP will be incorporated into the new CFO contract. Practices included in CRP, EQIP, or WRP will be incorporated into the new CFO contract. Practices included in CRP or EQIP contracts or WRP cost-share agreements must be included in a CFO contract if an owner or producer wishes to participate. Participants in CFO with CRP, EQIP, or WRP practices incorporated into CFO contracts are responsible for operating and maintaining these practices for the balance of the period specified in the original program contract, unless otherwise stated in the conservation farm plan and CFO contract.</p>
