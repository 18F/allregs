                                Sec. 1655.14  Loan payments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Loan payments must be made through payroll deduction in  accordance with the loan agreement. Once loan payments begin, the  employing agency cannot terminate the payroll deductions at the  employee's request, unless the TSP instructs it to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The participant may make additional payments by mailing a  personal check or guaranteed funds to the TSP record keeper. If the TSP  receives a payment that repays the outstanding loan amount and overpays  the loan by $10.00 or more, the overpayment will be refunded to the  participant. Overpayments of less than $10 will be applied to the  participant's account and will not be refunded. If a loan overpayment  refund is returned as undeliverable, the TSP record keeper will attempt  to locate the participant. If the participant does not respond within 60  days, the TSP will forfeit the overpayment refund to the Plan. The  participant can claim the forfeited funds, although they will not be  credited with TSP investment fund returns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The initial payment on a loan is due on or before the 60th day  following   the loan issue date. Interest accrues on the loan from the date of  issuance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subsequent payments are due at regular intervals as prescribed  in the loan agreement, or most recent amortization, according to the  participant's pay cycle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a payment is not made when due, the TSP will notify the  participant of the missed payment and the participant must make up the  payment in full. If the participant does not make up all missed payments  by the end of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in  which the first payment was missed, the TSP will declare the loan to be  a taxable distribution in accordance with Sec. 1655.15. The  participant's make-up payment must be in the form of a personal check or  guaranteed funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Interest will accrue on all missed payments and will be included  in the calculation of any taxable distribution subsequently declared in  accordance with Sec. 1655.15. Interest will also accrue on payments  missed while a participant is in nonpay status.  [68 FR 35515, June 13, 2003, as amended at 72 FR 53414, Sept. 19, 2007]</p>
