To achieve this capability  the physical protection system shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Detect attempts to gain unauthorized access or introduce  unauthorized material across material access or vital area boundaries by  stealth or force using the following subsystems and subfunctions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Barriers to channel persons and material to material access and  vital area entry control points and to delay any unauthorized  penetration attempts by persons or materials sufficient to assist  detection and permit a response that will prevent the penetration; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Access detection subsystems and procedures to detect, assess  and communicate any unauthorized penetration attempts by persons or  materials at the time of the attempt so that the response can prevent  the unauthorized access or penetration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Detect attempts to gain unauthorized access or introduce  unauthorized materials into material access areas or vital areas by  deceit using the following subsystems and subfunctions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Access authorization controls and procedures to provide current  authorization schedules and entry criteria for both persons and  materials; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Entry controls and procedures to verify the identity of persons  and materials and assess such identity against current authorization  schedules and entry criteria before permitting entry and to initiate  response measures to deny unauthorized entries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Permit only authorized activities and conditions within  protected areas, material access areas, and vital areas. To achieve this  capability the physical protection system shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Detect unauthorized activities or conditions within protected  areas, material access areas and vital areas using the following  subsystems and subfunctions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Controls and procedures that establish current schedules of  authorized activities and conditions in defined areas;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Boundaries to define areas within which the authorized  activities and conditions are permitted; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Detection and surveillance subsystems and procedures to  discover and assess unauthorized activities and conditions and  communicate them so that response can be such as to stop the activity or  correct the conditions to satisfy the general performance objective and  requirements of Sec. 73.20(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Permit only authorized placement and movement of strategic  special nuclear material within material access areas. To achieve this  capability the physical protection system shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Detect unauthorized placement and movement of strategic special  nuclear material within the material access area using the following  subsystems and subfunctions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Controls and procedures to delineate authorized placement and  control for strategic special nuclear material;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Controls and procedures to establish current authorized  placement and movement of all strategic special nuclear material within  material access areas;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Controls and procedures to maintain knowledge of the identity,  quantity, placement, and movement of all strategic special nuclear  material within material access areas; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Detection and monitoring subsystems and procedures to discover  and assess unauthorized placement and movement of strategic special  nuclear material and communicate them so that response can be such as to  return the strategic special nuclear material to authorized placement or  control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Permit removal of only authorized and confirmed forms and  amounts of strategic special nuclear material from material access  areas. To achieve this capability the physical protection system shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Detect attempts at unauthorized removal of strategic special  nuclear material from material access areas by stealth or force using  the following subsystems and subfunctions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Barriers to channel persons and materials exiting a material  access area to exit control points and to delay any unauthorized  strategic special nuclear material removal attempts sufficient to assist  detection and assessment and permit a response that will prevent the  removal; and satisfy the general performance objective and requirements  of Sec. 73.20(a); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Detection subsystems and procedures to detect, assess and  communicate any attempts at unauthorized removal of strategic special  nuclear material so that response to the attempt can be such as to  prevent the removal and satisfy the general performance objective and  requirements of Sec. 73.20(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Confirm the identity and quantity of strategic special nuclear  material presented for removal from a material access area and detect  attempts at unauthorized removal of strategic special nuclear material  from material access areas by deceit using the following subsystems and  subfunctions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Authorization controls and procedures to provide current  schedules for authorized removal of strategic special nuclear material  which specify the authorized properties and quantities of material to be  removed, the persons authorized to remove the material, and the  authorized time schedule;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Removal controls and procedures to identify and confirm the  properties and quantities of material being removed and verify the  identity of the persons making the removal and time of removal and  assess these against the current authorized removal schedule before  permitting removal; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Communications subsystems and procedures to provide for  notification of an attempted unauthorized or unconfirmed removal so that  response can be such as to prevent the removal and satisfy the general  performance objective and requirements of Sec. 73.20(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Provide for authorized access and assure detection of and  response to unauthorized penetrations of the protected area to satisfy  the general performance objective and requirements of Sec. 73.20(a).
