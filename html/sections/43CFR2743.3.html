The authorized officer will require full reimbursement from the lessee for the costs of the investigation. The authorized officer may, in his or her discretion, make an exception to the requirement of full reimbursement if the applicant demonstrates that such costs would result in undue hardship. The investigation shall include but not be limited to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A review of all records and inspection reports on file with the Bureau of Land Management, State, and local agencies relating to the history and use of the lands covered by a lease and any violations and enforcement problems that occurred during the term of the lease;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Consultation with the lessee and users of the landfill concerning site management and a review of all reports and logs pertaining to the type and amount of solid waste deposited at the landfill;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A visual inspection of the leased site; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An appropriate analysis of the soil, water and air associated with the area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The investigation conducted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section must establish that the involved lands contain only those quantities and types of hazardous substances consistent with household wastes, or wastes from conditionally exempt small quantity generators (40 CFR 261.5), and there is a reasonable basis to believe that the contents of the leased disposal site do not threaten human health and the environment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The applicant shall present certification from the State agency or agencies responsible for environmental

protection and enforcement that they have reviewed all records, inspection reports, studies, and other materials produced or considered in the course of the investigation and that based on these documents, such agency or agencies agree with the authorized officer that the contents of the leased disposal site in question do not threaten human health and the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The authorized officer shall not convey lands identified in paragraph (a) of this section if the investigation concludes that the lands contain hazardous substances at concentrations that threaten human health and the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The authorized officer shall retain as permanent records all environmental analyses and appropriate documentation, investigation reports, State certifications, and other materials produced or considered in determining the suitability of public lands for conveyance under this section.
