                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Aliens granted Temporary Protected Status must re-register periodically in accordance with USCIS instructions. Such registration applies to nationals of those foreign states designated or redesignated for more than one year by DHS. Applicants for periodic re-registration must apply during the registration period provided by USCIS. Re-registering applicants will not need to re-pay the TPS application fee that was required for initial registration except that aliens requesting employment authorization must submit the application fee for employment authorization. The biometric service fee described in 103.7(b), or an approved fee waiver, will be required of applicants age 14 and over. By completing

the application, applicants attest to their continuing eligibility. Such applicants do not need to submit additional supporting documents unless USCIS requests them to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an alien fails to register without good cause, USCIS will withdraw Temporary Protected Status. USCIS may, for good cause, accept and approve an untimely registration request.
