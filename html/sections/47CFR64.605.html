                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Additional emergency calling requirements applicable to internet-based TRS providers. (1) As of December 31, 2008, the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(iv) of this section shall not apply to providers of VRS and IP Relay to which Sec. 64.605(b) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each provider of Internet-based TRS shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Accept and handle emergency calls and access, either directly or via a third party, a commercially available database that will allow the provider to determine an appropriate PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority that corresponds to the caller's location, and to relay the call to that entity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Implement a system that ensures that the provider answers an incoming emergency call before other non-emergency calls (i.e., prioritize emergency calls and move them to the top of the queue);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Request, at the beginning of each emergency call, the caller's name and location information, unless the Internet-based TRS provider already has, or has access to, a Registered Location for the caller;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Deliver to the PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority, at the outset of the outbound leg of an emergency call, at a minimum, the name of the relay user and location of the emergency, as well as the name of the relay provider, the CA's callback number, and the CA's identification number, thereby enabling the PSAP,

designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority to re-establish contact with the CA in the event the call is disconnected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the event one or both legs of an emergency call are disconnected (i.e., either the call between the TRS user and the CA, or the outbound voice telephone call between the CA and the PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority), immediately re-establish contact with the TRS user and/or the appropriate PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority and resume handling the call; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Ensure that information obtained as a result of this section is limited to that needed to facilitate 911 services, is made available only to emergency call handlers and emergency response or law enforcement personnel, and is used for the sole purpose of ascertaining a user's location in an emergency situation or for other emergency or law enforcement purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> E911 Service for VRS and IP Relay--(1) Scope. The following requirements are only applicable to providers of VRS or IP Relay. Further, the following requirements apply only to 911 calls placed by registered users whose Registered Location is in a geographic area served by a Wireline E911 Network and is available to the provider handling the call.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> E911 Service. As of December 31, 2008:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> VRS or IP Relay providers must, as a condition of providing service to a user, provide that user with E911 service as described in this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> VRS or IP Relay providers must transmit all 911 calls, as well as ANI, the caller's Registered Location, the name of the VRS or IP Relay provider, and the CA's identification number for each call, to the PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority that serves the caller's Registered Location and that has been designated for telecommunications carriers pursuant to Sec. 64.3001 of this chapter, provided that ``all 911 calls'' is defined as ``any communication initiated by an VRS or IP Relay user dialing 911'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All 911 calls must be routed through the use of ANI and, if necessary, pseudo-ANI, via the dedicated Wireline E911 Network; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Registered Location, the name of the VRS or IP Relay provider, and the CA's identification number must be available to the appropriate PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority from or through the appropriate automatic location information (ALI) database.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Service level obligation. Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if a PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority is not capable of receiving and processing either ANI or location information, a VRS or IP Relay provider need not provide such ANI or location information; however, nothing in this paragraph affects the obligation under paragraph (c) of this section of a VRS or IP Relay provider to transmit via the Wireline E911 Network all 911 calls to the PSAP, designated statewide default answering point, or appropriate local emergency authority that serves the caller's Registered Location and that has been designated for telecommunications carriers pursuant to Sec. 64.3001 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Registered location requirement. As of December 31, 2008, VRS and IP Relay providers must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Obtain from each Registered Internet-based TRS User, prior to the initiation of service, the physical location at which the service will first be utilized; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the VRS or IP Relay is capable of being used from more than one location, provide their registered Internet-based TRS users one or more methods of updating their Registered Location, including at least one option that requires use only of the iTRS access technology necessary to access the VRS or IP Relay. Any method utilized must allow a registered Internet-based TRS user to update the Registered Location at will and in a timely manner.
