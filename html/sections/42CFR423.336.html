If the adjusted allowable risk corridor costs for the Part D plan for the coverage year are less than the first threshold lower limit, but not less than the second threshold lower limit, of the risk corridor for the Part D plan for the coverage year, CMS reduces the total of the payments made to the Part D plan for the coverage year under this section by an amount (or otherwise recovers from the Part D sponsor an amount) equal to 50 percent (or, for 2006 and 2007, 75 percent) of the difference between the first threshold lower limit of the risk corridor and the adjusted allowable risk corridor costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Costs between first and second threshold lower limits.

If the adjusted allowable risk corridor costs for the Part D plan for the coverage year are less the second threshold lower limit of the risk corridor for the Part D plan for the coverage year, CMS reduces the total of the payments made to the Part D sponsor for the coverage year under this section by an amount (or otherwise recovers from the Part D sponsor an amount) equal to the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 50 percent (or, for 2006 and 2007, 75 percent) of the difference between the first threshold lower limit and the second threshold lower limit; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 80 percent of the difference between the second threshold upper limit of the risk corridor and the adjusted allowable risk corridor costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Payment methods. CMS makes payments after a coverage year after obtaining all of the cost data information in paragraph (c)(1) of this section necessary to determine the amount of payment. CMS will not make payments under this section if the Part D sponsor fails to provide the cost data information in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Submission of cost data. Within 6 months of the end of a coverage year, the Part D sponsor must provide the information that CMS requires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Lump sum and adjusted monthly payments.
