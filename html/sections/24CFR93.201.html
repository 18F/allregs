                            <p class="depth0">HTF funds may be used to pay the following eligible costs:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Development hard costs. The actual cost of constructing or  rehabilitating housing. These costs include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For new construction projects, costs to meet the new  construction standards of the grantee in Sec. 93.301;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For rehabilitation, costs to meet the property standards for  rehabilitation projects in Sec. 93.301(b);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For both new construction and rehabilitation projects, costs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To demolish existing structures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To make utility connections including off-site connections from  the property line to the adjacent street; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To make improvements to the project site that are in keeping  with improvements of surrounding, standard projects. Site improvements  may include onsite roads and sewer and water lines necessary to the  development of the project. The project site is the property, owned by  the project owner, upon which the project is located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For both new construction and rehabilitation of multifamily  rental housing projects, costs to construct or rehabilitate laundry and  community facilities that are located within the same building as the  housing and which are for the use of the project residents and their  guests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Costs to make utility connections or to make improvements to the  project site, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)  and (iii) of this section are also eligible in connection with the  acquisition of standard housing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Refinancing costs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost to refinance existing debt  secured by rental housing units that are being rehabilitated with HTF  funds, but only if the refinancing is necessary to reduce the overall  housing costs and to make the housing more affordable and proportional  to the number of HTF-assisted units in the rental project. The  proportional rehabilitation cost must be greater than the proportional  amount of debt that is refinanced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The grantee must establish refinancing guidelines and state them  in its consolidated plan described in 24 CFR part 91. The guidelines  shall describe the conditions under which the grantee will refinance  existing debt. At minimum, the guidelines must demonstrate that  rehabilitation is the primary eligible activity and ensure that this  requirement is met by establishing a minimum level of rehabilitation per  unit or a required ratio between rehabilitation and refinancing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acquisition costs. Costs of acquiring improved or unimproved  real property, including acquisition by homebuyers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Related soft costs. Other reasonable and necessary costs  incurred by the owner or grantee and associated with the financing, or  development (or both) of new construction, rehabilitation or acquisition  of housing assisted with HTF funds. These costs include, but are not  limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Architectural, engineering, or related professional services  required to prepare plans, drawings, specifications, or work write-ups.  The costs may be paid if they were incurred not more than 24 months  before the date that HTF funds are committed to the project and the  grantee expressly permits HTF funds to be used to pay the costs in the  written agreement committing the funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Costs to process and settle the financing for a project, such as  private lender origination fees, credit reports, fees for title  evidence, fees for recordation and filing of legal documents, building  permits, attorneys' fees, private appraisal fees and fees for an  independent cost estimate, and builders' or developers' fees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Costs of a project audit, including certification of costs  performed by a certified public accountant, that the grantee may require  with respect to the development of the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Costs to provide information services such as affirmative  marketing and fair housing information to prospective homeowners and  tenants as required by Sec. 93.350.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For new construction or rehabilitation, the cost of funding an  initial operating deficit reserve, which is a reserve to meet any  shortfall in project income during the period of project rent-up (not to  exceed 18 months) and which may only be used to pay project operating  expenses, scheduled payments to a replacement reserve, and debt service.  Any HTF funds placed in an operating deficit reserve that remain  unexpended after the period of project rent-up may be retained for  project reserves if permitted by the grantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Staff and overhead costs of the grantee directly related to  carrying out the project, such as work specifications preparation, loan  processing, and inspections. For multi-unit projects, such costs must be  allocated among HTF-assisted units in a reasonable manner and  documented. Although these costs may be charged as project costs, these  costs cannot be charged to or paid by the assisted families.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For both new construction and rehabilitation, costs for the  payment of impact fees that are charged for all projects within a  jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Operating cost assistance and operating cost assistance  reserves. For HTF-assisted units for which project-based assistance is  not available, when necessary and subject to the limitations in Sec.  93.200(a), HTF funds may be used to pay for operating cost assistance  and operating cost assistance reserves, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operating costs are costs for insurance, utilities, real  property taxes, and maintenance and scheduled payments to a reserve for  replacement of major systems (provided that the payments must be based  on the useful life of each major system and expected replacement cost)  of an HTF-assisted unit. The eligible amount of HTF funds per unit for  operating cost assistance is determined based on the deficit remaining  after the monthly rent payment for the HTF-assisted unit is applied to  the HTF-assisted unit's share of monthly operating costs. The maximum  amount of the operating cost assistance to be provided to an HTF- assisted rental project must be based on the underwriting of the project  and must be specified in a written agreement between the grantee and the  recipient. The written agreement may commit, from a fiscal year HTF  grant, funds for operating cost assistance for a multiyear period  provided that the grantee is able meet its expenditure deadline in Sec.  93.400(d). The grantee may renew operating cost assistance with future  fiscal year HTF grants during the affordability period and the amount  must be based on the need for the operating cost assistance at the time  the assistance is renewed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An operating cost assistance reserve may be funded by the  grantee for HTF-assisted units in a project where   the grantee determines in its underwriting of the project the reserve is  necessary to ensure the project's financial feasibility. If the  operating cost assistance reserve is funded with appropriated HTF funds,  the allowable amount of the reserve shall not exceed the amount  determined by the grantee to be necessary to provide operating cost  assistance for HTF-assisted units, for a period not to exceed 5 years,  based on an analysis of potential deficits remaining after the expected  rent payments for the HTF-assisted unit are applied to the HTF-assisted  unit's expected share of operating costs. The grantee may renew  operating cost assistance reserves with future fiscal year HTF grants  during the affordability period and the amount must be based on the need  for the operating cost assistance reserve at the time the assistance for  the reserve is renewed. If the operating cost assistance reserve is  funded with non-appropriated HTF funds, the reserve may be funded for  the period of affordability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Relocation costs. The cost of relocation payments and other  relocation assistance to persons displaced by the project are eligible  costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Relocation payments include replacement housing payments,  payments for moving expenses, and payments for reasonable out-of-pocket  costs incurred in the temporary relocation of persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other relocation assistance means staff and overhead costs  directly related to providing advisory and other relocation services to  persons displaced by the project, including timely written notices to  occupants, referrals to comparable and suitable replacement property,  property inspections, counseling, and other assistance necessary to  minimize hardship.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Costs relating to payment of loans. If the HTF funds are not  used to directly pay a cost specified in this section, but are used to  pay off a construction loan, bridge financing loan, or guaranteed loan,  the payment of principal and interest for such loan is an eligible cost  only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The loan was used for eligible costs specified in this section,  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The HTF assistance is part of the original financing for the  project and the project meets the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Construction undertaken before the HTF funds are committed to  the project. HTF funds cannot be used for development hard costs, as  provided in paragraph (a) of this section, or for acquisition,  undertaken before the HTF funds are committed to the project. However,  the written agreement committing the HTF funds to the project may  authorize HTF funds to be used for architectural and engineering costs  and other related professional services, as provided in paragraph (d)(1)  of this section.</p>
