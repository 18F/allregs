                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 1823.7004(c), insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Safety and Health (APR 2002)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. NASA's safety priority is to protect: (1) The public, (2) astronauts and pilots, (3) the NASA workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts), and (4) high-value equipment and property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Contractor shall take all reasonable safety and occupational health measures in performing this contract. The Contractor shall comply with all Federal, State, and local laws applicable to safety and occupational health and with the safety and occupational health standards, specifications, reporting requirements, and any other relevant requirements of this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Contractor shall take, or cause to be taken, any other safety, and occupational health measures the Contracting Officer may reasonably direct. To the extent that the Contractor may be entitled to an equitable adjustment for those measures under the terms and conditions of this contract, the equitable adjustment shall be determined pursuant to the procedures of the changes clause of this contract; provided, that no adjustment shall be made under this Safety and Health clause for any change for which an equitable adjustment is expressly provided under any other clause of the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Contractor shall immediately notify and promptly report to the Contracting Officer or a designee any accident, incident, or exposure resulting in fatality, lost-time occupational injury, occupational disease, contamination of property beyond any stated acceptable limits set forth in the contract Schedule; or property loss of $25,000 or more, or Close Call (a situation or occurrence with no injury, no damage or only minor damage (less than $1,000) but possesses the potential to cause any type mishap, or any injury, damage, or negative mission impact) that may be of immediate interest to NASA, arising out of work performed under this contract. The Contractor is not required to include in any report an expression of opinion

as to the fault or negligence of any employee. In addition, service contractors (excluding construction contracts) shall provide quarterly reports specifying lost-time frequency rate, number of lost-time injuries, exposure, and accident/incident dollar losses as specified in the contract Schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Contractor shall investigate all work-related incidents, accidents, and Close Calls, to the extent necessary to determine their causes and furnish the Contracting Officer a report, in such form as the Contracting Officer may require, of the investigative findings and proposed or completed corrective actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(1)</em> The Contracting Officer may notify the Contractor in writing of any noncompliance with this clause and specify corrective actions to be taken. When the Contracting Officer becomes aware of noncompliance that may pose a serious or imminent danger to safety and health of the public, astronauts and pilots, the NASA workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts), or high value mission critical equipment or property, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor orally, with written confirmation. The Contractor shall promptly take and report any necessary corrective action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contracting Officer may notify the Contractor in writing of any noncompliance with this clause and specify corrective actions to be taken. When the Contracting Officer becomes aware of noncompliance that may pose a serious or imminent danger to safety and health of the public, astronauts and pilots, the NASA workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts), or high value mission critical equipment or property, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor orally, with written confirmation. The Contractor shall promptly take and report any necessary corrective action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Contractor fails or refuses to institute prompt corrective action in accordance with subparagraph (f)(1) of this clause, the Contracting Officer may invoke the stop-work order clause in this contract or any other remedy available to the Government in the event of such failure or refusal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (g) and any applicable Schedule provisions and clauses, with appropriate changes of designations of the parties, in all solicitations and subcontracts of every tier, when one or more of the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The work will be conducted completely or partly on premises owned or controlled by the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The work includes construction, alteration, or repair of facilities in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The work, regardless of place of performance, involves hazards that could endanger the public, astronauts and pilots, the NASA workforce (including Contractor employees working on NASA contracts), or high value equipment or property, and the hazards are not adequately addressed by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations (if applicable).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) determines that the assessed risk and consequences of a failure to properly manage and control the hazard(s) warrants use of the clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) may exclude the provisions of paragraph (g) from its solicitation(s) and subcontract(s) of every tier when it determines that the clause is not necessary because the application of the OSHA and DOT (if applicable) regulations constitute adequate safety and occupational health protection. When a determination is made to exclude the provisions of paragraph (g) from a solicitation and subcontract, the Contractor must notify and provide the basis for the determination to the Contracting Officer. In subcontracts of every tier above the micro-purchase threshold for which paragraph (g) does not apply, the Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) shall insert the substance of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (f) of this clause).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Authorized Government representatives of the Contracting Officer shall have access to and the right to examine the sites or areas where work under this contract is being performed in order to determine the adequacy of the Contractor's safety and occupational health measures under this clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The contractor shall continually update the safety and health plan when necessary. In particular, the Contractor shall furnish a list of all hazardous operations to be performed, and a list of other major or key operations required or planned in the performance of the contract, even though not deemed hazardous by the Contractor. NASA and the Contractor shall jointly decide which operations are to be considered hazardous, with NASA as the final authority. Before hazardous operations commence, the Contractor shall submit for NASA concurrence--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written hazardous operating procedures for all hazardous operations; and/or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Qualification standards for personnel involved in hazardous operations.</p><p class="depth3">(End of clause)
