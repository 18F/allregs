It is essential that the identities of all individuals who furnish information under an express promise of confidentiality be protected. Additionally,

granting individuals access to information relating to criminal and civil law enforcement, as well as the release of certain disclosure accountings, could interfere with ongoing investigations and the orderly administration of justice, in that it could result in the concealment, alteration, destruction, or fabrication of information; could hamper the identification of offenders and the disposition of charges; and could jeopardize the safety and well being of parents and their children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> System identifier and name:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> N03834-1, Special Intelligence Personnel Access File.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exemption: (i) Information specifically authorized to be classified under E.O. 12,958, as implemented by DOD 5200.1-R, may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, military service, Federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Portions of this system of records are exempt from the following subsections of the Privacy Act: (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G) through (I), and (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) and (k)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reasons: (i) Exempted portions of this system contain information that has been properly classified under E.O. 12356, and that is required to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exempted portions of this system also contain information considered relevant and necessary to make a determination as to qualifications, eligibility, or suitability for access to classified information and was obtained by providing an express or implied assurance to the source that his or her identity would not be revealed to the subject of the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> System identifier and name:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> N04060-1, Navy and Marine Corps Exchange Sales and Security Files.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exemption: (i) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).

Access could result in the release of properly classified information which could compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy. Amendment of the records would interfere with the ongoing investigation and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continually reinvestigated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> From subsection (e)(1) because in the course of the investigation it is not always possible, at least in the early stages of the inquiry, to determine relevance and or necessity as such determinations may only occur after the information has been evaluated.

With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the development of intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> From subsection (e)(8) because compliance would provide an impediment to law enforcement by interfering with the ability to issue warrants or subpoenas and by revealing investigative techniques, procedures, or evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> From subsection (f) and (g) because this record system is exempt from the individual access provisions of subsection (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Consistent with the legislative purpose of the Privacy Act of 1974, the DON will grant access to nonexempt material in the records being maintained. Disclosure will be governed by the DON's Privacy Regulation, but will be limited to the extent that the identity of confidential sources will not be compromised; subjects of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal violation will not be alerted to the investigation; the physical safety of witnesses, informants and law enforcement personnel will not be endangered, the privacy of third parties will not be violated; and that the disclosure would not otherwise impede effective law enforcement.
