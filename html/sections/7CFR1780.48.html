                            <p class="depth0">Grants are sometimes made by regional commissions for projects eligible for RUS assistance. RUS has agreed to administer such funds in a manner similar to administering RUS assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When RUS has funds in the project, no charge will be made for administering regional commission funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When RUS has no loan or grant funds in the project, an administrative charge will be made pursuant to the Economy Act of 1932 (31 U.C.S. 1535). A fee of 5 percent of the first $100,000 of a regional commission grant and 1 percent of any amount over $100,000 will be paid to RUS by the commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). RUS Bulletin 1780-23 will be followed in determining the responsibilities of RUS. The ARC Federal Co-chairman and the State program official will provide each other with the necessary notification and certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other regional commissions. Title V of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3121 et seq.) authorizes other commissions similar to ARC. RUS Bulletin 1780-23 will be used to develop a separate project management agreement between RUS and the commission for each project. The agreement should be prepared by the State program official as soon as notification is received that a commission grant will be made and the amount is confirmed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Regional commission grants should be obligated as soon as possible in accordance with Sec. 1780.41, except that the announcement procedure referred to in RUS Staff Instruction 1780-2 is not applicable. Regional commission grants will be disbursed from the Finance Office in the same manner as RUS funds.
