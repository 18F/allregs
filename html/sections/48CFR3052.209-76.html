Section 2 of the Federal Protective Service Guard  Contracting Reform Act of 2008, Public Law 110-356, generally prohibits  the Department of Homeland Security from entering into a contract for  guard services under the Federal Protective Service (FPS) guard services  program with any business concern owned, controlled, or operated by an  individual convicted of a serious felony.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this clause:</p><p class="depth2">Business concern means a commercial enterprise and the people who  constitute it.</p><p class="depth2">Felony means an offense which, if committed by a natural person,  would be punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one  year.</p><p class="depth2">Individual means any person, corporation, partnership, or other  entity with a legally independent status.</p><p class="depth2">Convicted of a felony means any conviction of a felony in violation  of state or federal criminal statutes, including the Uniform Code of  Military Justice, whether entered on a verdict or plea, including a plea  of nolo contendere, for which a sentence has been imposed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A business concern that is owned, controlled, or operated by an  individual who has been convicted of any felony, and that wishes to  submit a bid, proposal, or other offer on a solicitation to obtain a FPS  contract for guard services, must submit with its offer an award request  as specified in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A financial, voting, operational, or employment interest in the  business concern of the individual's spouse, child, or other family  member, or person with whom the individual shares his or her household,  will be imputed to the individual in determining whether the individual  owns, controls, or operates a business concern.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An individual owns, controls, or operates a business concern by  fulfilling or holding the following types of roles or interests with  respect to the business concern:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Director or officer, including incumbents of boards and offices  that perform duties ordinarily performed by a chairman or member of a  board of directors, a secretary, treasurer, president, a vice president,  or   other chief official of a business concern, including Chief Financial  Officer, Chief Operating Officer, or Chief contracting official.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Officials of comparable function and status to those described  in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this clause as exist in partnerships of all  kind and other business organizations, including sole proprietorships.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A general partner in a general or limited partnership.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An individual with a limited partnership interest of 25% or  more.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An individual that has the:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Power to vote, directly or indirectly, 25% or more interest in  any class of voting stock of the business concern;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Ability to direct in any manner the election of a majority of  the business concern's directors or trustees; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Ability to exercise a controlling influence over the business  concern's management and policies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Generally, the existence of one or more of the roles or  interests set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, including roles  or interests attributed to the individual, will be sufficient to  determine that the individual owns, controls or operates the business  concern. However, specific facts of the case may warrant a different  determination by Government in light of all of the facts and  circumstances. Conversely, ownership, control, or the ability to operate  the business concern, if it exists in fact, can be reflected by other  roles or interests, and the offeror or contractor should reveal the  existence of felony convictions if there is doubt as to whether the  individual owns, controls or operates the business concern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Award request. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A business concern owned, operated or  controlled by an individual convicted of any felony may submit an award  request to the Contracting Officer. The basis for such request shall be  either that the subject felony is not a serious felony as defined in  (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.171-5; that such individual no longer owns, controls  or operates the business concern; or that commission of the serious  felony no longer calls into question the individual or business  concern's integrity or business ethics and that an award would be  consistent with the mission of FPS. The business concern shall bear the  burden of proof for award requests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Contracting Officer in his or her sole discretion, is  unable to affirmatively determine that the subject felony is not a  serious felony as defined in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.171-5 or that such  individual no longer owns, controls or operates the business concern,  then the Contracting Officer shall deny the award request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Head of the Contracting Activity has sole discretion to  approve an award request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A copy of the award request with supporting documentation or a  copy of a previously approved award request shall be attached with the  bid or proposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An award request shall contain the basis for the request (i.e.,  that the subject felony is not a serious felony as defined by this  regulation; that the convicted individual does not or no longer owns,  controls or operates the business concern; or that the commission of a  serious felony no longer calls into question the individual or business  concern's integrity or business ethics and that an award would be  consistent with the mission of FPS). The award request shall contain, at  a minimum, the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name and Date of Birth of Individual Convicted of a felony.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A full description of which roles or interests indicate that  the individual owns, controls, or operates or may own control or operate  the business concern.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Date sentenced.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Statute/Charge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Docket/Case Number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Court/Jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The nature and circumstances surrounding the conviction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Protective measures taken by the individual or business  concern to reduce or eliminate the risk of further misconduct.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Whether the individual has made full restitution for the  felony.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Whether the individual has accepted responsibility for past  misconduct resulting in the felony conviction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Upon the request of the Contracting Officer, and prior to  contract award, in addition to information described in paragraph (d)(5)  of this clause, the business concern must provide such other  documentation as is requested by the Contracting Officer to use in  determining and evaluating ownership, control, or operation; the nature  of the felonies committed; and such other information as is needed to  make a decision on whether award should be made to the offeror under the  Federal Protective Service Guard Contracting Reform Act of 2008. The  refusal to timely provide such documentation may serve as grounds to  preclude contract award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Privacy Statement. The offeror shall provide the following  statement to any individual whose information will be submitted in an  award request pursuant to (d)(5) and (6) of this clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Privacy Notice. The collection of this information is authorized  by the Federal Protective Service Guard Contracting Reform Act of 2008  (Pub. L. 110-356) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implementing  regulations at Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) 48 CFR  3009.171. This information is being collected to determine whether an  individual that owns, controls, or operates the business concern  submitting this offer has been convicted of a felony that would  disqualify the offeror from receiving   an award. This information will be used by and disclosed to DHS  personnel and contractors or other agents who require this information  to determine whether an award request should be approved or denied.  Additionally, DHS may share this personal information with the U.S.  Justice Department and other Federal and State agencies for collection,  enforcement, investigatory, or litigation purposes, or as otherwise  authorized. Submission of this information by the individual is  voluntary, however, failure to provide it may result in denial of an  award to the offeror. Individuals who wish to correct inaccurate  information in or to remove their information from an offer that has  been submitted should contact the business concern submitting the offer  and request correction. Should individuals seek to correct inaccurate  information or remove their information from an offer that has been  submitted in response to a solicitation for FPS guard services prior to  contract award, an authorized representative of the business concern  submitting the offer must contact the contracting officer of record and  request that the firm's offer be formally withdrawn or submit a  correction to the award request. After contract award, it is recommended  that an authorized representative of the business concern that submitted  the inaccurate or erroneous information contact the contracting officer  of record. The contracting officer will handle such requests on a case  by case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that  [Check one]:</p><p class="depth2">--It is not a business concern owned, controlled, or operated by an  individual convicted of a felony.</p><p class="depth2">--It is a business concern owned, controlled, or operated by an  individual convicted of a felony, and has submitted an award request  pursuant to paragraph (d) of this clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If an award request is applied for, the offeror shall attach the  request with supporting documentation, to the bid or proposal. The  supporting documentation may include copies of prior award requests  granted to the offeror.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The notification in this paragraph applies if this is an  indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract, blanket purchase  agreement, or other contractual instrument that may result in the  issuance of task orders, calls or option to extend the terms of a  contract. The Contractor must immediately notify the Contracting Officer  in writing upon any felony conviction of personnel who own, control or  operate a business concern as defined in paragraph (c) of this clause at  any time during the performance of this contract. Upon notification of a  felony conviction the Contracting Officer will review and make a new  determination of eligibility prior to the issuance of any task order,  call or exercise of an option.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [74 FR 58856, Nov. 16, 2009, 74 FR 66584, Dec. 16, 2009]</p>
