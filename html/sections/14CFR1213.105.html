                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Only spokespersons designated by the Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs, or his/her designee, are authorized to speak for the Agency in an official capacity regarding NASA policy, programmatic, and budget issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In response to media interview requests, NASA will offer articulate and knowledgeable spokespersons who can best serve the needs of the media and the American public. However, journalists may have access to the NASA officials they seek to interview, provided those NASA officials agree to be interviewed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NASA employees may speak to the media and the public about their work. When doing so, employees shall notify their immediate supervisor and coordinate with their public affairs office in advance of interviews whenever possible, or immediately thereafter, and are encouraged, to the maximum extent practicable, to have a Public Affairs Officer present during interviews. If Public Affairs Officers are present, their role will be to attest to the content of the interview, support the interviewee, and provide post-interview follow up with the media, as necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> NASA, as an Agency, does not take a position on any scientific conclusions. That is the role of the broad scientific community and the nature of the scientific process. NASA scientists may draw conclusions and may, consistent with this policy, communicate those conclusions to the media. However, NASA employees who present personal views outside their official area of expertise or responsibility must make clear that they are presenting their individual views--not the views of the Agency--and ask that they be sourced as such.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Appropriated funds may only be used to support Agency missions and objectives consistent with legislative or presidential direction. Government funds shall not be used for media interviews or other communication activities that go beyond the scope of Agency responsibilities and/or an employee's official area of expertise or responsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Media interviews will be ``on-the-record'' and attributable to the person making the remarks, unless the interviewee is authorized to do otherwise by the Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs or Center Public Affairs Director, or their designees. Any NASA employee providing material to the press will identify himself/herself as the source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Audio recordings may be made by NASA with consent of the interviewee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> NASA employees are not required to speak to the media.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Public information volunteered by a NASA official will not be considered exclusive to any one media source and will be made available to other sources, if requested.</p>
