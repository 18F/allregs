                            <p class="depth0">Unless the Medicaid agency provides the following satisfactory  assurances to CMS, CMS will not grant a waiver under this subpart and  may terminate a waiver already granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Health and welfare. The agency must assure that necessary  safeguards have been taken to protect the health and welfare of the  beneficiaries of services by assuring that the following conditions are  met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adequate standards for all types of providers that furnish  services under the waiver are met. (These standards must be reasonably  related to the requirements of the waiver service to be furnished.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The standards of any State licensure or certification  requirements are met for services or for individuals furnishing services  under the waiver.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All facilities covered by section 1616(e) of the Act, in which  home and community-based services are furnished, are in compliance with  applicable State standards that meet the requirements of 45 CFR part  1397 for board and care facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Physician reviews of prescribed psychotropic drugs (when  prescribed for purposes of behavior control of waiver beneficiaries)  occur at least every 30 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Financial accountability. The agency must assure financial  accountability for funds expended for home and community-based services.  The State must provide for an independent audit f its waiver program.  The performance of a single financial audit, in accordance with the  Single Audit Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-502, enacted on October 19, 1984),  is deemed to satisfy the requirement for an independent audit. The  agency must maintain and make available to HHS, the Comptroller General,  or other designees, appropriate financial records documenting the cost  of services furnished to individuals age 65 or older under the waiver  and the State plan, including reports of any independent audits  conducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evaluation of need. The agency must provide for an initial  evaluation (and periodic reevaluations) of the need for the level of  care furnished in a NF when there is a reasonable indication that  individuals age 65 or older might need those services in the near  future, but for the availability of home and community-based services.  The procedures used to assess level of care for a potential waiver  beneficiary must be at least as stringent as any existing State  procedures applicable to individuals entering a NF. The qualifications  of individuals performing the waiver assessment must be as high as those  of individuals assessing the need for NF care, and the assessment  instrument itself must be the same as any assessment instrument used to  establish level of care of prospective inpatients in NFs. A periodic  reevaluation of the level of care must be performed. The period of  reevaluation of level of care cannot extend beyond 1 year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> waiver for individuals age 65 or older during a waiver  year will not exceed the APEL, calculated in accordance with Sec.   441.354.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reporting. The agency must assure that it will provide CMS  annually with information on the waiver's impact. The information must  be consistent with a reasonable data collection plan   designed by CMS and must address the waiver's impact on--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The type, amount, and cost of services furnished under the State  plan; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The health and welfare of beneficiaries of the services  described in Sec.  440.181 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3">Effective Date Note: At 57 FR 29156, June 30, 1992, Sec.  441.352  was added. This section contains information collection and  recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval  has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
