This does not include modifications to existing orders, but these modifications are covered postaward, see 5.705. These notices are for ``informational purposes only,'' therefore, 5.203 does not apply. Contracting officers should concurrently use their usual solicitation practice (e.g., e-Buy).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contracting officers shall identify proposed contract actions, funded in whole or in part by the Recovery Act, by using the following instructions which are also available in the Recovery FAQs under ``Buyers/Engineers'' at the Governmentwide Point of Entry (GPE) (https://www.fedbizopps.gov):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If submitting notices electronically via ftp or email, enter the word ``Recovery'' as the first word in the title field.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If using the GPE directly, select the ``yes'' radio button for the ``Is this a Recovery and Reinvestment Act action'' field on the ``Notice Details'' form (Step 2) located below the ``NAICS Code'' field. In addition, enter the word ``Recovery'' as the first word in the title field.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In preparing the description required by 5.207(a)(16), use clear and concise language to describe the planned procurement. Use descriptions of the goods and services (including construction), that can be understood by the general public. Avoid the use of acronyms or terminology that is not widely understood by the general public.
