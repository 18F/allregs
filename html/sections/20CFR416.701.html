                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Report provisions. The Social Security Administration, to achieve efficient administration of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled, requires that you (or your representative) must report certain events to us. It is important for us to know about these events because they may affect your continued eligibility for SSI benefits or the amount of your benefits. This subpart tells you what events you must report; what your reports must include; and when reports are due. The rules regarding reports are in Secs. 416.704 through 416.714.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Penalty deductions. If you fail to make a required report when it is due, you may suffer a penalty. This subpart describes the penalties; discusses when we may impose them; and explains that we will not impose a penalty if you have good cause for failing to report timely. The rules regarding penalties are in Secs. 416.722 through 416.732.</p>
