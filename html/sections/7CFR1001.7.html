                            <p class="depth0">Pool plant means a plant, unit of plants, or system of plants as specified in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, but excluding a plant described in paragraph (h) of this section. The pooling standards described in paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section are subject to modification pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A distributing plant, other than a plant qualified as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or Sec. --------.7(b) of any other Federal milk order, from which during the month 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) are disposed of as route disposition or are transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other distributing plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and transfers must be to outlets in the marketing area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any distributing plant located in the marketing area which during the month processed at least 25 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) into ultra-pasteurized or aseptically-processed fluid milk products.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A supply plant from which fluid milk products are transferred or diverted to plants described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section subject to the additional conditions described in this paragraph. In the case of a supply plant operated by a cooperative association handler described in Sec. 1000.9(c), fluid milk products that the cooperative delivers to pool plants directly from producers' farms shall be treated as if transferred from the cooperative association's plant for the purpose of meeting the shipping requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In each of the months of January through August and December, such shipments and transfers to distributing plants must not equal less than 10 percent of the total quantity of milk (except the milk of a producer described in Sec. 1001.12(b)) that is received at the plant or diverted from it pursuant to Sec. 1001.13 during the month;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In each of the months of September through November, such shipments and transfers to distributing plants must equal not less than 20 percent of the total quantity of milk (except the milk of a producer described in Sec. 1001.12(b)) that is received at the plant or diverted from it pursuant to Sec. 1001.13 during the month;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If milk is delivered directly from producers' farms that are located outside of the states included in the marketing area or outside Maine or West Virginia, such producers must be grouped by state into reporting units and each reporting unit must independently meet the shipping requirements of this paragraph; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Concentrated milk transferred from the supply plant to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I shall be excluded from the supply plant's shipments in computing the percentages in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any distributing plant, located within the marketing area as described on May 1, 2006, in Sec. 1001.2;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From which there is route disposition and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products in any non-Federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk provided that 25 percent or more of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at such plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) is disposed of as route disposition and/or is transferred in the form of packaged fluid milk products to other plants. At least 25 percent of such route disposition and/or transfers, in aggregate, are in any non-Federally regulated marketing area(s) located within one or more States that require handlers to pay minimum prices for raw milk. Subject to the following exclusions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The plant is described in Sec. 1001.7(a), (b), or (e);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The plant is subject to the pricing provisions of a State-operated milk pricing plan which provides for the payment of minimum class prices for raw milk;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The plant is described in Sec. 1000.8(a) or (e); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A producer-handler described in Sec. 1001.10 with less than three million pounds during the month of route dispositions and/or transfers of packaged fluid milk products to other plants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Two or more plants that are located in the marketing area and operated by the same handler may qualify as a unit by meeting the total and in-area route distribution requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section subject to the following additional requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least one of the plants in the unit qualifies as a pool distributing plant pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other plants in the unit must process at least 60 percent of monthly receipts of producer milk only as Class I or Class II products and must be located in the Northeast marketing area, as defined in Sec. 1001.2, in a pricing zone providing the same or a lower Class I price than the price applicable at the distributing plant(s) included in the unit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A written request to form a unit, or to add or remove plants from a unit, or to cancel a unit, must be filed with the market administrator prior to the first day of the month for which unit formation is to be effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Two or more supply plants operated by the same handler, or by one or more cooperative associations, may qualify for pooling as a system of plants by meeting the applicable percentage requirements of paragraph (c) of this section in the same manner as a single plant subject to the following additional requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A supply plant system will be effective for the period of August 1 through July 31 of the following year. Written notification must be given to the market administrator listing the plants to be included in the system prior to the first day of July preceding the effective date of the system. The plants included in the system shall be listed in the sequence in which they shall qualify for pool plant status based on the minimum deliveries required. If the deliveries made are insufficient to qualify the entire system for pooling, the last listed plant shall be excluded from the system, followed by the plant next-to-last on the list, and continuing in this sequence until remaining listed plants have met the minimum shipping requirements; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each plant that qualifies as a pool plant within a system shall continue each month as a plant in the system through the following July unless the plant subsequently fails to qualify for

pooling, the handler submits a written notification to the market administrator prior to the first day of the month that the plant be deleted from the system, or that the system be discontinued. Any plant that has been so deleted from the system, or that has failed to qualify as a pool plant in any month, will not be part of the system for the remaining months through July. For any system that qualifies in August, no plant may be added in any subsequent month through the following July unless the plant replaces another plant in the system that has ceased operations and the market administrator is notified of such replacement prior to the first day of the month for which it is to be effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable shipping percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A producer-handler plant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An exempt plant as defined in Sec. 1000.8(e);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that is located within the marketing area if the plant also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and more than 50 percent of its route distribution has been in such other Federal order marketing area for 3 consecutive months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which is not located within any Federal order marketing area that meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and has had greater route disposition in such other Federal order's marketing area for 3 consecutive months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that is located in another Federal order marketing area if the plant meets the pooling requirements of such other Federal order and does not have a majority of its route distribution in this marketing area for 3 consecutive months or if the plant is required to be regulated under such other Federal order without regard to its route disposition in any other Federal order marketing area; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A plant qualified pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section which also meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and from which greater qualifying shipments are made to plants regulated under the other Federal order than are made to plants regulated under the order in this part, or the plant has automatic pooling status under the other Federal order.
