                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. The soundness of a savings association's mortgage  loans and real estate investments, and those of its service  corporation(s), depends to a great extent upon the adequacy of the loan  underwriting used to support these transactions. An appraisal standard  is one of several critical components of a sound underwriting policy  because appraisal reports contain estimates of the value of collateral  held or assets owned. This section sets forth the responsibilities of  management to develop, implement, and maintain appraisal standards in  determining compliance with the appraisal requirements of Sec. 563.170  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition. For purposes of this section, management means: the  directors and officers of a savings association, or service corporation  of such savings association, as those terms are defined in Sec. Sec.  561.18 and 561.35 of this chapter respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responsibilities of management. An appraisal is a critical  component of the loan underwriting or real estate investment decision.  Therefore, management shall develop, implement, and maintain appraisal  policies to ensure that appraisals reflect professional competence and  to facilitate the reporting of estimates of market value upon which  savings associations may rely to make lending decisions. To achieve  these results:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Management shall develop written appraisal policies, subject to  formal adoption by the savings association's   board of directors, that it shall implement in consultation with other  appropriate personnel. These policies shall ensure that adequate  appraisals are obtained and proper appraisal procedures are followed  consistent with the requirements of this part 564.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Management shall develop and adopt guidelines and institute  procedures pertaining to the hiring of appraisers to perform appraisal  services for the savings association consistent with the requirements of  this part 564. These guidelines shall set forth specific factors to be  considered by management including, but not limited to, an appraiser's  State certification or licensing, professional education, and type of  experience. An appraiser's membership in professional appraisal  organizations may be considered consistent with the requirements of  Sec. 564.6</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Management shall review on an annual basis the performance of  all approved appraisers used within the preceding 12-month period for  compliance with (i) the savings association's appraisal policies and  procedures; and (ii) the reasonableness of the value estimates reported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> shall  not apply with respect to appraisals on nonresidential properties  prepared on form reports approved by the Office and completed in  accordance with the applicable instructional booklet.
