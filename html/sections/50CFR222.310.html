Before application of flipper tags or insertion of PIT tags, all flippers and the neck/shoulder area will be examined and scanned for the presence of any pre-existing flipper or PIT tags.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Turtles may also be weighed, measured, and photographed prior to release.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When handling turtles exhibiting fibropapilloma, all equipment (tagging equipment, tape measures, etc.) that comes in contact with the turtle shall be cleaned with a mild bleach solution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Every action shall be reported in writing to the Assistant Administrator, or authorized representative, via the agency or institution designated by the state to record such events.
