                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and purpose. Sections 107 and 209 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), contain certain requirements relating to the maintenance of records for reporting and disclosure purposes and for determining the pension benefits to which participants and beneficiaries are or may become entitled. This section provides standards applicable to both pension and welfare plans concerning the use of electronic media for the maintenance and retention of records required to be kept under sections 107 and 209 of ERISA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General requirements. The record maintenance and retention requirements of sections 107 and 209 of ERISA are satisfied when using electronic media if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The electronic recordkeeping system has reasonable controls to ensure the integrity, accuracy, authenticity and reliability of the records kept in electronic form;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The electronic records are maintained in reasonable order and in a safe and accessible place, and in such manner as they may be readily inspected or examined (for example, the recordkeeping system should be capable of indexing, retaining, preserving, retrieving and reproducing the electronic records);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The electronic records are readily convertible into legible and readable paper copy as may be needed to satisfy reporting and disclosure requirements or any other obligation under Title I of ERISA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The electronic recordkeeping system is not subject, in whole or in part, to any agreement or restriction that would, directly or indirectly, compromise or limit a person's ability to comply with any reporting and disclosure requirement or any other obligation under Title I of ERISA; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Adequate records management practices are established and implemented (for example, following procedures for labeling of electronically maintained or retained records, providing a secure storage environment, creating back-up electronic copies and selecting an off-site storage location, observing a quality assurance program evidenced by regular evaluations of the electronic recordkeeping system including periodic checks of electronically maintained or retained records, and retaining paper copies of records that cannot be clearly, accurately or completely transferred to an electronic recordkeeping system).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Legibility and readability. All electronic records must exhibit a high degree of legibility and readability when displayed on a video display terminal or other method of electronic transmission and when reproduced in paper form. The term ``legibility'' means the observer must be able to identify all letters and numerals positively and quickly to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. The term ``readability'' means that the observer must be able to recognize a group of letters or numerals as words or complete numbers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disposal of original paper records. Original paper records may be disposed of any time after they are transferred to an electronic recordkeeping system that complies with the requirements of this section, except such original records may not be discarded if the electronic record would not constitute a duplicate or substitute record under the terms of the plan and applicable federal or state law.
