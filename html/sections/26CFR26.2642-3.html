                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. In determining the applicable fraction with respect  to a charitable lead annuity trust--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The numerator is the adjusted generation-skipping transfer tax  exemption (adjusted GST exemption); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The denominator is the value of all property in the trust  immediately after the termination of the charitable lead annuity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjusted GST exemption defined. The adjusted GST exemption is  the amount of GST exemption allocated to the trust increased by an  amount equal to the interest that would accrue if an amount equal to the  allocated GST exemption were invested at the rate used to determine the  amount of the estate or gift tax charitable deduction, compounded  annually, for the actual period of the charitable lead annuity. If a  late allocation is made to a charitable lead annuity trust, the adjusted  GST exemption is the amount of GST exemption allocated to the trust  increased by the interest that would accrue if invested at such rate for  the period beginning on the date of the late allocation and extending  for the balance of the actual period of the charitable lead annuity. The  amount of GST exemption allocated to a charitable lead annuity trust is  not reduced even though it is ultimately determined that the allocation  of a lesser amount of GST exemption would have resulted in an inclusion  ratio of zero. For purposes of chapter 13, a charitable lead annuity  trust is any trust providing an interest in the form of a guaranteed  annuity described in Sec. 25.2522(c)-3(c)(2)(vi) of this chapter for  which the transferor is allowed a charitable deduction for Federal  estate or gift tax purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example. T creates a charitable lead annuity trust for a 10-year  term with the remainder payable to T's grandchild. T timely allocates an  amount of GST exemption to the   trust which T expects will ultimately result in a zero inclusion ratio.  However, at the end of the charitable lead interest, because the  property has not appreciated to the extent T anticipated, the numerator  of the applicable fraction is greater than the denominator. The  inclusion ratio for the trust is zero. No portion of the GST exemption  allocated to the trust is restored to T or to T's estate.</p>
