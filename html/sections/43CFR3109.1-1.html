                            <p class="depth0">The Act of May 21, 1930 (30 U.S.C. 301-306), authorizes either the  leasing of oil and gas deposits under railroad and other rights-of-way  to the owner of the right-of-way or the entering of a compensatory  royalty agreement with adjoining landowners. This authority shall be  exercised only with respect to railroad rights-of-way and easements  issued pursuant either to the Act of March 3, 1875 (43 U.S.C. 934 et  seq.), or pursuant to earlier railroad right-of-way statutes, and with  respect to rights-of-way and easements issued pursuant to the Act of  March 3, 1891 (43 U.S.C. 946 et seq.). The oil and gas underlying any  other right-of-way or easement is included within any oil and gas lease  issued pursuant to the Act which covers the lands within the right-of- way, subject to the limitations on use of the surface, if any, set out  in the statute under which, or permit by which, the right-of-way or  easement   was issued, and such oil and gas shall not be leased under the Act of  May 21, 1930.</p>
