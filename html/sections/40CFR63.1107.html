                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each piece of equipment within a process unit that can reasonably be expected to contain equipment in organic HAP service is presumed to be in organic HAP service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in organic HAP

service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in organic HAP service, it must be determined that the percent organic HAP content can be reasonably expected not to exceed the percent by weight control applicability criteria specified in Sec.  63.1103 for an affected source on an annual average basis. For purposes of determining the percent organic HAP content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment, Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An owner or operator may use good engineering judgment rather than the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section to determine that the percent organic HAP content does not exceed the percent by weight control applicability criteria specified in Sec.  63.1103 for an affected source. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service, however, the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is in organic HAP service, the determination can be revised after following the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section, or by documenting that a change in the process or raw materials no longer causes the equipment to be in organic HAP service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Samples used in determining the percent organic HAP content shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Requirements for pressure relief devices. For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, except as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section for pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas or vapor service. Except as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the owner or operator of an acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected source or polycarbonate production affected source must also comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section for all pressure relief devices in organic HAP service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operating requirements. Except during a pressure release event, operate each pressure relief device in organic HAP gas or vapor service with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pressure release requirements. For pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas or vapor service, the owner or operator must comply with either paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section following a pressure release, as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the pressure relief device does not consist of or include a rupture disk, conduct instrument monitoring, as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A, no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure relief device returns to organic HAP service following a pressure release to verify that the pressure relief device is operating with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background, except as provided in Sec.  63.171 or Sec.  63.1024(d), as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the pressure relief device consists of or includes a rupture disk, install a replacement disk as soon as practicable after a pressure release, but no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure release, except as provided in Sec.  63.171 or Sec.  63.1024(d), as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pressure release management. Except as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, emissions of organic HAP to the atmosphere from pressure relief devices in organic HAP service are prohibited, and the owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section for all pressure relief devices in organic HAP service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator must equip each pressure relief device in organic HAP service with a device(s) or parameter monitoring system that is capable of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Identifying the pressure release;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Recording the time and duration of each pressure release; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Notifying operators immediately that a pressure release is occurring. The device or monitoring system may be either specific to the pressure relief

device itself or may be associated with the process system or piping, sufficient to indicate a pressure release to the atmosphere. Examples of these types of devices and systems include, but are not limited to, a rupture disk indicator, magnetic sensor, motion detector on the pressure relief valve stem, flow monitor, or pressure monitor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If any pressure relief device in organic HAP service releases to atmosphere as a result of a pressure release event, the owner or operator must calculate the quantity of organic HAP released during each pressure release event and report this quantity as required in paragraph (g) of this section. Calculations may be based on data from the pressure relief device monitoring alone or in combination with process parameter monitoring data and process knowledge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pressure relief devices routed to a control device, process, fuel gas system, or drain system. If a pressure relief device in organic HAP service is designed and operated to route all HAP emissions from pressure releases through a closed vent system to a control device or to a process, fuel gas system, or drain system, the owner or operator is not required to comply with paragraphs (e)(1), (2), or (3) (if applicable) of this section for that pressure relief device. The fuel gas system or closed vent system and control device (if applicable) must meet the requirements of Sec.  63.172 or Sec.  63.1034, as applicable (except that the term ``pressure relief devices'' shall apply instead of the term ``equipment leaks'' in Sec.  63.1034). The drain system (if applicable) must meet the requirements of Sec.  63.136.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Recordkeeping requirements. For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, for pressure relief devices in organic HAP service, keep records of the information specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A list of identification numbers for pressure relief devices that vent to a fuel gas system, process, drain system, or closed-vent system and control device, under the provisions in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A list of identification numbers for pressure relief devices subject to the provisions in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A list of identification numbers for pressure relief devices equipped with rupture disks, under the provisions in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The dates and results of the monitoring following a pressure release for each pressure relief device subject to the provisions in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. The results shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The background level measured during each compliance test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum instrument reading measured at each piece of equipment during each compliance test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For pressure relief devices in organic HAP service subject to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, keep records of each pressure release to the atmosphere, including the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The source, nature, and cause of the pressure release.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date, time, and duration of the pressure release.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An estimate of the quantity of total HAP emitted during the pressure release and the calculations used for determining this quantity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The actions taken to prevent this pressure release.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The measures adopted to prevent future such pressure releases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Periodic reports. For owners or operators of an acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected source or polycarbonate production affected source subject to paragraph (e) of this section, Periodic Reports must include the information specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section for pressure relief devices in organic HAP service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For pressure relief devices in organic HAP service subject to paragraph (e) of this section, report confirmation that all monitoring to show compliance was conducted within the reporting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas or vapor service subject to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, report any instrument reading of 500 ppm above background or greater, more

than 5 days after the relief device returns to organic HAP gas or vapor service after a pressure release.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For pressure relief devices in organic HAP service subject to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, report each pressure release to the atmosphere, including the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The source, nature, and cause of the pressure release.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date, time, and duration of the pressure release.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An estimate of the quantity of total HAP emitted during the pressure release and the method used for determining this quantity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The actions taken to prevent this pressure release.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The measures adopted to prevent future such pressure releases.
