                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section prescribes the performance requirements for localizer  equipment components of the ISMLS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The localizer antenna system must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be located on the extension of the centerline of the runway at  the stop end;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be adjusted so that the course line be on a vertical plane  containing the centerline of the runway served;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Have the minimum height necessary to comply with the coverage  requirements prescribed in paragraph (j) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Be located at a distance from the stop end of the runway that is  consistent with safe obstruction clearance practices;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Not obscure any light of the approach landing system; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Be installed on frangible mounts or beyond the 1000[foot] light  bar.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On runways where limited terrain prevents the localizer antennae  from being positioned on the runway centerline extended, and the cost of  the land fill or a tall tower antenna support is prohibitive, the  localizer antenna array may be offset, including a collocated ground  station, so that the course intercepts the centerline at a point  determined by the amount of the angular offset and the glide path angle.  If other than a runway centerline localizer is used, the criteria in  subpart C of part 97 of this chapter is applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At locations where two separate ISMLS facilities serve opposite  ends of of a single runway, an interlock must ensure that only the  facility serving the approach direction being used will radiate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The radiation from the localizer antenna system must produce a  composite field pattern which is pulse duration modulated, the time  average equivalent to amplitude modulation by a 90 Hz and 150 Hz tone.  The localizer station must transmit angular guidance information over a  C-band microwave carrier on narrow, scanned antenna beams that are  encoded to produce a modulation in space which, after averaging over  several beam scans, is equivalent to the modulation used for  conventional ILS as specified in subpart C of this part. The radiation  field pattern must produce a course sector with one tone predominating  on one side of the course and with the other tone predominating on the  opposite side. When an observer faces the localizer from the approach  end of the runway, the depth of modulation of the radio frequency  carrier due to the 150 Hz tone must predominate on his right hand and  that due to the 90 Hz tone must predominate on his left hand.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All horizontal angles employed in specifying the localizer field  patterns must originate from the center of the localizer antenna system  which provides the signals used in the front course sector.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The ISMLS course sector angle must be adjustable between 3  degrees and 9 degrees. The applicable course sector angle will be  established and approved on an individual basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The ISMLS localizer must operate in the band 5000 MHz to 5030  MHz. The frequency tolerance may not exceed 0.0001  percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The emission from the localizer must be vertically polarized.  The horizontally polarized component of the radiation of the course line  may not exceed that which corresponds to a DDM error of 0.016 when an  aircraft is positioned on the course line and is in a roll attitude of  20 degrees from the horizontal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The localizer must provide signals sufficient to allow  satisfactory operation of a typical aircraft installation within the  localizer and glide path coverage sectors. The localizer coverage sector  must extend from the center of the localizer antenna system to distances  of 18 nautical miles minimum within 10 degrees  from the front course line, and 10 nautical miles minimum between 10 degrees and 35 degrees from the  front course line. The ISMLS localizer signals must be receivable at the  distances specified up from a surface extending outward from the  localizer antenna and within a sector in the elevation plane from 0.300  to 1.750 of the established glide path angle ([thetas]).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section, in all  parts of the coverage volume specified in paragraph (i) of this section,  the peak field strength may not be less than -87 dBW/m\2\, and must  permit satisfactory operational usage of ISMLS localizer facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The minimum peak field strength on the ISMLS glide path and  within the localizer course sector from a distance of 10 nautical miles  to a height of   100 feet (30 meters) above the horizontal plane containing the  threshold, may not be less than +87 dBW/m\2\.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Above 16 degrees, the ISMLS localizer signals must be reduced to  as low a value as practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Bends in the course line may not have amplitudes which exceed  the following:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Amplitude (DDM) (95 pct.</p><p class="depth2">Zone                             probability) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Outer limit of coverage to:</p><p class="depth2">ISMLS point ``A''........................  0.031.</p><p class="depth2">ISMLS point ``A'' to ISMLS point ``B''...  0.031 at ISMLS point ``A''</p><p class="depth2">decreasing at linear rate</p><p class="depth2">to 0.015 at ISMLS point</p><p class="depth2">``B''.</p><p class="depth2">ISMLS point ``B'' to ISMLS point ``C''...  0.015. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> The amplitudes referred to in paragraph (m) of this section are  the DDMs due to bends as realized on the mean course line, when  correctly adjusted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> The radio frequency carrier must meet the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nominal depth of modulation of the radio frequency carrier  due to each of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz tones must be 20 percent along the  course line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The depth of modulation of the radio frequency carrier due to  each of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz tones must be between 18 and 22 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The frequency tolerance of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz modulated tones  must be within 25 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Total harmonic content of the 90 Hz tone may not exceed 10  percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Total harmonic content of the 150 Hz tone may not exceed 10  percent. However, a 300 Hz tone may be transmitted for identification  purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> At every half cycle of the combined 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave form,  the modulation tones must be phase-locked so that within the half course  sector, the demodulated 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave forms pass through zero in  the same direction within 20 degrees with phase relative to the 150 Hz  component. However, the phase need not be measured within the half  course sector.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> The mean course line must be adjusted and maintained within  .015DDM from the runway centerline at the ISMLS  reference datum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> The nominal displacement sensitivity within the half course  sector at the ISMLS reference datum, must be 0.00145 DDM/meter  (0.00044DDM/foot). However, where the specified nominal displacement  sensitivity cannot be met, the displacement sensitivity must be adjusted  as near as possible to that value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> The lateral displacement sensitivity must be adjusted and  maintained within 17 percent of the nominal value. Nominal sector width  at the ISMLS reference datum is 210 meters (700 feet).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> The increase of DDM must be substantially linear with respect to  angular displacement from the front course line where DDM is zero, up to  angle on either side of the front course line where the DDM is 0.180.  From that angle to 10 degrees, the DDM may not be  less than 0.180. From 10 degrees to 35 degrees, the DDM may not be less than 0.155.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> The localizer must provide for the simultaneous transmission of  an identification signal which meets the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It must be specific to the runway and approach direction, on the  same radio frequency carrier, as used for the localizer function.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transmission of the identification signal may not interfere in  any way with the basic localizer function.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The signal must be produced by pulse duration modulation of the  radio frequency carrier resulting in a detected audio tone in the  airborne VHF receiver of 1020 Hz 50Hz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The depth of modulation must be between the limits of 10 and 12  percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The emissions carrying the identification signal must be  vertically polarized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The identification signal must employ the International Morse  Code and consist of three letters. It must be preceded by the  International Morse Code signal of the letter ``M'' followed by a short  pause where it is necessary to distinguish the ISMLS facility from other  navigational facilities in the immediate area. At airports where both an  ISMLS and an ILS are in operation, each facility must have a different  identification call sign.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The signal must be transmitted at a speed corresponding to  approximately seven words per minute, and must be repeated at  approximately equal intervals, not less than six times   per minute, during which time the localizer is available for operational  use. When the localizer is not available for transmission, the  identification signal must be suppressed.</p>
