                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This part prescribes the minimum regulatory capital requirements for savings associations. Subpart B of this part applies to all savings associations, except as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> A savings association that uses Appendix C of this part must comply with the minimum qualifying criteria for internal risk measurement and management processes for calculating risk-based capital requirements, utilize the methodologies for calculating risk-based capital requirements, and make the required disclosures described in that appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A savings association that uses Appendix C of this part must comply with the minimum qualifying criteria for internal risk measurement and management processes for calculating risk-based capital requirements, utilize the methodologies for calculating risk-based capital requirements, and make the required disclosures described in that appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subpart B of this part does not apply to the computation of risk-based capital requirements by a savings association that uses Appendix C of this part. However, these savings associations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Must compute the components of capital under Sec. 567.5, subject to the modifications in sections 11 and 12 of Appendix C of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Must meet the leverage ratio requirement at Sec. Sec. 567.2(a)(2) and 567.8 with tier 1 capital, as computed under sections 11 and 12 of Appendix C of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Must meet the tangible capital requirement described at Sec. Sec. 567.2(a)(3) and 567.9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Are subject to Sec. Sec. 567.3 (individual minimum capital requirement), 567.4 (capital directives); and 567.10 (consequences of failure to meet capital requirements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Are subject to the reservations of authority at Sec. 567.11, which supplement the reservations of authority at section 1 of Appendix C of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Optional transition provisions related to the implementation of consolidation requirements under FAS 167--(1) Scope, applicability, and purpose. The section provides optional transition provisions for a savings association that is required for financial and regulatory reporting purposes, as a result of its implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (referred to in this section as FAS 167), to consolidate certain

variable interest entities (VIEs) as defined under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These transition provisions apply through the end of the fourth quarter following the date of a savings association's implementation of FAS 167 (implementation date).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exclusion period--(i) Exclusion of risk-weighted assets for first and second quarters. For the first two quarters, after the implementation date (exclusion period), including for the two calendar quarter-end regulatory report dates within those quarters, a savings association may exclude from risk-weighted assets:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Subject to the limitations in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, assets held by a VIE, provided that the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The VIE existed prior to the implementation date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The savings association did not consolidate the VIE on its balance sheet for calendar quarter-end regulatory report dates prior to the implementation date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The savings association must consolidate the VIE on its balance sheet beginning as of the implementation date as a result of its implementation of FAS 167; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The savings association excludes all assets held by VIEs described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Subject to the limitations in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, assets held by a VIE that is a consolidated asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) program, provided that the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The savings association is the sponsor of the ABCP program,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prior to the implementation date, the savings association consolidated the VIE onto its balance sheet under GAAP and excluded the VIE's assets from the savings association's risk-weighted assets; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The savings association chooses to exclude all assets held by ABCP program VIEs described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Risk-weighted assets during exclusion period. During the exclusion period, including the two calendar quarter-end regulatory report dates within the exclusion period, a savings association adopting the optional provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section must calculate risk-weighted assets for its contractual exposures to the VIEs referenced in paragraph (c)(2)(i) on the implementation date and include this calculated amount in its risk-weighted assets. Such contractual exposures may include direct-credit substitutes, recourse obligations, residual interests, liquidity facilities, and loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Inclusion of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) in tier 2 capital for the first and second quarters. During the exclusion period, including for the two calendar quarter-end regulatory report dates within the exclusion period, a savings association that excludes VIE assets from risk-weighted assets pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section may include in tier 2 capital the full amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) calculated as of the implementation date that is attributable to the assets it excludes pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section (inclusion amount). The amount of ALLL includable in tier 2 capital in accordance with this paragraph shall not be subject to the limitations set forth at Sec. 567.5(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Phase-in period--(i) Exclusion amount. For purposes of this paragraph, exclusion amount is defined as the amount of risk-weighted assets excluded in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section as of the implementation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Risk-weighted assets for the third and fourth quarters. A savings association that excludes assets of consolidated VIEs from risk-weighted assets pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section may, for the third and fourth quarters, after the implementation date (phase-in period), including for the two calendar quarter-end regulatory report dates within those quarters exclude from risk-weighted assets 50 percent of the exclusion amount, provided that the savings association may not include in risk-weighted assets pursuant to this paragraph an amount less than the aggregate risk-weighted assets calculated pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Inclusion of ALLL in Tier 2 capital for the third and fourth quarters. A savings association that excludes assets of

consolidated VIEs from risk-weighted assets pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section may, for the phase-in period, include in tier 2 capital 50 percent of the inclusion amount it included in tier 2 capital during the exclusion period, notwithstanding the limit on including ALLL in tier 2 capital in Sec. 567.5(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Implicit recourse limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision in Sec. 567.0(c), assets held by a VIE to which a savings association has provided recourse through credit enhancement beyond any contractual obligation to support assets it has sold may not be excluded from risk-weighted assets.
