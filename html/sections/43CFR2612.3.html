If patent issues to the State, it is the responsibility of the State to assure that the lands are cultivated and settled. If the State does not dispose of the patented lands within 5 years to actual settlers who have cultivated at least 20 acres of each 160 acre tract, or if the State disposes of the patented lands to any person who is not an actual settler or has not cultivated 20 acres of the 160 acre tract, action may be taken to revest title in the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 2613_Preference Right Upon Restoration</p>
