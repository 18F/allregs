                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> DOT calculates the hourly rates for manual searching, computer  operator/programmer time, and time spent reviewing records, when  performed by employees, based on the grades and rates in the General  Schedule Locality Pay Table for the Locality of Washington-Baltimore- Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA, or equivalent grades, plus 16% to  cover fringe benefits, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> GS-1 through GS-8 (or equivalent)--Hourly rate of GS-5 step 7  plus 16%;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> GS-9 through GS-12 (or equivalent)--Hourly rate of GS-10 step 7  plus 16%;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> GS-13 through GS-14 (or equivalent)--Hourly rate of GS-13 step 7  plus 16%; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> GS-15 and above (or equivalent)--Hourly rate of GS-15 step 7  plus 16%.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> DOT determines the standard fee for a manual or electronic  search to locate records by multiplying the searcher's hourly rate as  set forth in paragraph (a) of this section by the time spent conducting  the search.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> DOT's standard fee for review of records is the reviewer's rate  set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, multiplied by the time the  reviewer spent determining whether the located records are responsive to  the request and whether the responsive records or segregable portions  are exempt from disclosure, as explained in paragraphs (h), (i), and (j)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> DOT determines the standard fee for duplication of records as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Per copy of each page (not larger than 8.5 x 14 inches)  reproduced by photocopy or similar means (includes costs of personnel  and equipment)--US $0.10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Per copy prepared by any other method of duplication--actual  direct cost of production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If DOT utilizes a contractor to perform any services described  in this section, the standard fee is based on the equivalent hourly  rate(s). DOT does not utilize contractors to discharge responsibilities  that only DOT may discharge under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In some cases, depending upon the category of requester and the  use for which the records are requested, the fees computed in accordance  with the standard fee schedule in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this  section are either reduced or not charged, as prescribed by other  provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For purposes of fees only, there are four categories of FOIA  requests:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests submitted by a commercial entity and/or for a  commercial use;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests submitted by an educational or noncommercial scientific  institution whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research (and not  for a commercial use);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requests submitted by a representative of the news media; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All other requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> When records are requested by a commercial requester and/or for  a commercial use, the fees assessed are reasonable standard charges for  document search, duplication, and review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> When records are requested by an educational or noncommercial  scientific institution whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research  or by a representative of the news media (i.e., for a non-commercial  use), fees are limited to reasonable standard charges for document  duplication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> For any request not described in paragraph (h) or (i) of this  section, fees are limited to reasonable standard charges for document  search and duplication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Fees under this subpart do not apply to any special study,  special statistical compilation, table, or other record requested under  49 U.S.C. 329(c). The fee for the performance of such a service is the  actual cost of the work involved in compiling the record. All such fees  received by DOT in payment of the cost of such work are deposited in a  separate account administered under the direction of the Secretary, and  may be used for the ordinary expenses incidental to providing the  information.</p>
