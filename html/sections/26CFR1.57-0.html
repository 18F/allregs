                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of the minimum tax for tax preferences (subtitle A, chapter I, part VI), the items of tax preference are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Excess investment interest,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The excess of accelerated depreciation on section 1250 property over straight line depreciation,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The excess of accelerated depreciation on section 1245 property subject to a net lease over straight line depreciation,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The excess of the amortization deduction for certified pollution control facilities over the depreciation otherwise allowable,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The excess of the amortization deduction for railroad rolling stock over the depreciation otherwise allowable,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The excess of the fair market value of a share of stock received pursuant to a qualified or restricted stock option over the exercise price,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The excess of the addition to the reserve for losses on bad debts of financial institutions over the amount which have been allowable based on actual experience,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The excess of the percentage depletion deduction over the adjusted basis of the property, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The capital gains deduction allowable under section 1202 or an equivalent amount in the case of corporations.
Accelerated depreciation on section 1245 property subject to a net lease and excess investment interest are not items of tax preference in the case of a corporation, other than a personal holding company (as defined in section 542) and an electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)). In addition, excess investment interest is an item of tax preference only for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1972. Rules for the determination of the items of tax preference are contained in Sec. Sec.  1.57-1 through 1.57-5. Generally, in the case of a nonresident alien or foreign corporation, the application of Sec. Sec.  1.57-1 through 1.57-5 will be limited to cases in which the taxpayer has income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Special rules for the treatment of items of tax preference in the case of certain entities and the treatment of items of tax preference relating to income from sources outside the United States are provided in section 58 and in Sec. Sec.  1.58-1 through 1.58-8.
