                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice to the Commissioner. If a State no longer wishes to  perform the disability determination function, it will notify us in  writing. The notice must be from an official authorized to act for the  State for this purpose. The State will provide an opinion from the  State's Attorney General verifying the authority of the official who  gave the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effective date of assumption. The State agency will continue to  perform whatever activities of the disability determination function it  is performing at the time the notice referred to in paragraph (a) of  this section is given for not less than 180 days or, if later, until we  have complied with the requirements of Sec. 416.1092. For example, if  the State is not making disability determinations (because we previously  assumed responsibility for making them) but is performing other  activities related to the disability determination function at the time  it gives notice, the State will continue to do these activities until  the requirements of this paragraph are met. Thereafter, we will assume  complete responsibility for performing the disability determination  function.  [46 FR 29211, May 29, 1981, as amended at 62 FR 38455, July 18, 1997]</p>
