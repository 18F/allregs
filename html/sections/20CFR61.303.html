                            <p class="depth0">A determination that an employee has been detained by a hostile  force or person may be made on the basis that the employee has  disappeared under circumstances that make detention appear probable. In  making the determination, the Office will consider the information and  the conclusion of the Department or agency of the United States having  knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the absence of the employee  as prima facie evidence of the employee's status. The presumptive status  of total disability of the missing person shall continue during the  period of the absence, or until death is in fact established or can be  legally presumed to have occurred.</p>
