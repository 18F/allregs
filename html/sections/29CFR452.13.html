For example, votes received from Canadian members in referendum elections held by an international must have been cast under procedures meeting the minimum requirements of the Act, and Canadian delegates participating at conventions of the international at which officers are elected must have been elected by secret ballot.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\14\ See Sec. 451.6 of this chapter.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
