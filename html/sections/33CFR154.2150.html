Any required flame screens or flame arresters must also be visually checked to ensure that they are not damaged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The proper position of all valves in the vapor line between the vessel's tanks and the facility vapor collection system must be verified before the start of the transfer operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A tank barge overfill control system that meets the requirements of 46 CFR 39.2009(a)(2) must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not be connected to an overfill sensor circuit that exceeds the system's rated inductance and capacitance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be tested for proper operation after connection is made with the vessel by simulating liquid high level and overfill at each tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When receiving vapor from a vessel with cargo tanks that are required to be inerted in accordance with 46 CFR 32.53, 46 CFR 153.500, or 46 CFR Table 151.05, the remotely operated cargo vapor shutoff valve required by 33 CFR 154.2101(a) must not be opened until the pressure at the facility vapor connection, downstream of the facility vapor connection, exceeds 0.2 pounds per square inch gauge (psig).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The initial cargo transfer rate must not exceed the rate agreed upon at the pre-transfer conference and 46 CFR 39.3001(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The cargo transfer rate must not exceed the maximum allowable transfer rate as determined by the lesser of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A transfer rate corresponding to the maximum vapor processing rate for the VCS, as specified in the facility operations manual; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The vessel's maximum transfer rate in accordance with 46 CFR 39.3001(d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> While transferring cargo to a vessel connected to a VCS, compressed air or gas may be used to clear cargo hoses and loading arms, but must not be used to clear cargo lines. However, compressed inert gas such as nitrogen can be used to clear cargo lines if a pigging system that meets 33 CFR 154.2104 is provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If a pigging system is used to clear cargo lines to the tank vessel while the vessel is connected to the facility VCS, the following operational requirements apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The VCS must be in operation, with all of the high-pressure alarms and shutdowns required by 33 CFR 154.2103 active, before and during pigging operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Personnel performing the pigging operation must be adequately trained on the specific pigging system being used. Accurate written procedures that address event sequence, equipment, safety precautions, and overpressurization hazards must be made available to all personnel involved in the pigging operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pigging procedures must be reviewed by both the vessel and facility personnel in charge as part of the pre-transfer conference.

The facility and vessel manifold valves must be closed immediately after the pig reaches the pig-receiving device; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the pigging system contains pressure-sensing, relieving, or alarming components in addition to those required by 33 CFR 154.2103, the components must be periodically tested in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (q) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> If one or more analyzers required by 33 CFR 154.2107(d) or (e) or 154.2110 become inoperable during a transfer operation, the operation may continue, provided that at least one analyzer remains operational; however, no further transfer operations may start until all inoperable analyzers are replaced or repaired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Whenever a condition results in a shutdown of the VCS, the emergency shutdown system required by 33 CFR 154.550 must be automatically activated to terminate cargo loading into tanks which are being vapor controlled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> If it is suspected that a flare in the VCS has had a flashback, or if a flame is detected on a detonation arrester required by 33 CFR 154.2109(c)(2), the transfer operation must stop and cannot restart until that detonation arrester and any quick-closing stop valves downstream of the detonation arrester are inspected and found to be in satisfactory condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Before each transfer operation, the freezing point of each cargo must be determined. If there is a possibility that the ambient air temperature during transfer operations will be at or below the freezing point of the cargo, adequate precautions must be taken to prevent freezing of vapor or condensate, or to detect and remove the frozen liquid and condensation to prevent accumulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Before each transfer operation, the cargo vapor must be evaluated to determine its potential to polymerize, and adequate precautions must be taken to prevent and detect polymerization of the cargo vapors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Mixing of incompatible vapors is prohibited. The VCS piping, equipment, hoses, valves, and arresters must be purged between vapor control operations that involve incompatible chemical vapors in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Chemical compatibility must be determined by using the procedures contained in 46 CFR part 150;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Purge gas must be an inert gas, air, or enriching gas, and must be adequate to reduce the level of residual vapor to a level at which reaction with the subsequent vapor cannot occur; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The required duration of purge time must be calculated and approved by the certifying entity during the certification or recertification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> After each transfer operation, the VCS piping, equipment, hoses, valves, and arresters must be purged with at least two-system volume exchanges of non-reactive gas or air so the VCS is left with a safe condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> VCS equipment and instrumentation must be tested in compliance with 33 CFR 156.170(g) or (i), with the COTP or designated representative invited to observe these tests. The test procedure and a checklist must be approved by the certifying entity during the initial certification of the system and incorporated into the facility operations manual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> A transfer operation that includes collection of vapor emitted to or from a vessel's cargo tanks must meet the transfer requirements of 33 CFR 156.120(aa), and a declaration of inspection meeting the requirements of 33 CFR 156.150 must be completed before each transfer.</p><p class="depth2">Alternative Analyzer and Pressure Sensor Reliability Testing</p>
