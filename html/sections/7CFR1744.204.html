RUS may condition such approval, if granted, on such requirements and restrictions as RUS may determine to be in the best interests of the Government, including, without limitation, the borrower's agreement to limit dividends or distributions of capital by an amount specified by RUS. Requests for such approvals must be submitted in writing to the relevant RUS regional office and shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the rural development project and the type of investment to be made, such as a loan, guarantee, stock purchase or equity investment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A reasonable estimate of the amount the borrower is committed to provide to the rural development project including investments that may be required in the future; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A pro forma balance sheet and cash flow statement for the period covering the borrower's future commitments to the rural development project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In determining whether to approve a rural development investment that may cause the borrower to exceed the maximum investment ratio or to fall below the minimum total assets ratio in the future, RUS will consider annual increases to the borrower's net worth and total assets as might be reasonably anticipated from the borrower's normal operations.</p>
