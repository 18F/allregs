                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Response to initial request. The FOIA Officer is authorized to grant or deny any request for a record and to determine appropriate fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Referral to, or consultation with, another agency. When a requester seeks access to records that originated in another Government agency, OGE will normally refer the request to the other

agency for response; alternatively, OGE may consult with the other agency in the course of deciding itself whether to grant or deny a request for access to such records. If OGE refers the request to another agency, it will notify the requester of the referral. If release of certain records may adversely affect United States relations with foreign governments, the Office will usually consult with the Department of State. A request for any records classified by some other agency will be referred to that agency for response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Honoring form or format requests. In making any record available to a requester, OGE will provide the record in the form or format requested, if the record already exists or is readily reproducible by OGE in that form or format. If a form or format request cannot be honored, OGE will so inform the requester and provide a copy of a nonexempt record in its existing form or format or another convenient form or format which is readily reproducible. OGE will not, however, generally develop a completely new record (as opposed to providing a copy of an existing record in a readily reproducible new form or format, as requested) of information in order to satisfy a request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Record cannot be located. If a requested record cannot be located from the information supplied, the FOIA Officer will so notify the requester in writing.
