                            <p class="depth0">The following code of ethics, adopted by Congress on July 11, 1958, shall apply to all Food and Drug Administration employees:</p><p class="depth0">Code of Ethics for Government Service</p><p class="depth0">Any person in Government service should:</p><p class="depth0">1. Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or Government department.</p><p class="depth0">2. Uphold the Constitution, laws, and legal regulations of the United States and of all governments therein and never be a party to their evasion.</p><p class="depth0">3. Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay; giving to the performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought.</p><p class="depth0">4. Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished.</p><p class="depth0">5. Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and never accept, for himself or his family, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties.</p><p class="depth0">6. Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a Government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty.</p><p class="depth0">7. Engage in no business with the Government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of his governmental duties.</p><p class="depth0">8. Never use any information coming to him confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private profit.</p><p class="depth0">9. Expose corruption wherever discovered.</p><p class="depth0">10. Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.</p>
