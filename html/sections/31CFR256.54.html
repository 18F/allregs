                                Sec. 256.54  What happens if Fiscal Service denies a request for payment?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Fiscal Service must deny any request for payment that fails to  satisfy the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 1304. The submitting agency may  request reconsideration of a payment denial. The submitting agency must  provide an explanation of how the request for payment meets the four  tests contained in section 256.1 of this part. If applicable, requests  for reconsideration must contain a reference to the agency's program  authority and include specific funding provisions that pertain to the  program activity that resulted in the claim. If, upon reconsideration,  Fiscal Service determines that payment from the Judgment Fund is  appropriate, and the agency has already made payment to the plaintiff or  claimant, Fiscal Service will reimburse the agency from the Judgment  Fund.</p>
