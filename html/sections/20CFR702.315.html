If either party requests that a formal  compensation order be issued, the district director must, within 30 days  of such request, prepare, file, and serve such order in accordance with  Sec. 702.349. Where the problem was of such nature that it was resolved  by telephone discussion or by exchange of written correspondence, the  district director must prepare a memorandum or order setting forth the  terms agreed upon and notify the parties either by telephone or in  writing, as appropriate. In either instance, when the employer or  carrier has agreed to pay, reinstate or increase monetary compensation  benefits, or to restore or appropriately change medical care benefits,  such action must be commenced immediately upon becoming aware of the  agreement, and without awaiting receipt of the memorandum or the formal  compensation order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where there are several conferences or discussions, the  provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply until the last  conference. The district director must, however, prepare and place in  his administrative file a short, succinct memorandum of each preceding  conference or discussion.</p>
