                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority and scope. The New York State Plan for Public Employee  Occupational Safety and Health received initial OSHA approval on June 1,  1984, and was certified as having successfully completed its  developmental steps on August 16, 2006. The plan designates the New York  Department of Labor as the State agency responsible for administering  the plan throughout the State. The plan includes legislation, the New  York Act (Public Employee Safety and Health Act, Chapter 729 of the Laws  of 1980/Article 2, Section 27-a of the New York State Labor Law),  enacted in 1980, and amended on April 17, 1984; August 2, 1985; May 25  and July 22, 1990; April 10, 1992; June 28, 1993; and April 1, 1997.  Under this legislation, the Commissioner of Labor has full authority to  enforce and administer all laws and rules protecting the safety and  health of all employees of the State and its political subdivisions. In  response to OSHA's concern that language in section 27-a.2 of the New  York Act, regarding the Commissioner of Education's authority with  respect to school buildings, raised questions about the coverage under  the plan of public school employees, in 1984 New York submitted  amendments to its plan consisting of Counsel's opinion and an assurance  that public school employees are fully covered under the terms of the  PESH Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards. The New York plan, as of revisions dated April 28,  2006, provides for the adoption of all Federal OSHA standards  promulgated as of that date, and for the incorporation of any subsequent  revisions or additions thereto in a timely manner, including in response  to Federal OSHA emergency temporary standards. The procedure for  adoption of Federal OSHA standards calls for publication of the  Commissioner of Labor's intent to adopt a standard in the New York State  Register 45 days prior to such adoption. Subsequent to adoption and upon  filing of the standard with the Secretary of State, a notice of final  action will be published as soon as is practicable in the State  Register. The plan also provides for the adoption of alternative or  different occupational safety and health standards if a determination is  made by the State that an issue is not properly addressed by OSHA  standards and is relevant to the safety and health of public employees.  In such cases, the Commissioner of Labor will develop an alternative  standard to protect the safety and health of public employees in  consultation with the Hazard Abatement Board, or on his/her own  initiative. The procedures for adoption of alternative standards contain  criteria for consideration of expert technical advice and allow  interested persons to request development of any standard and to  participate in any hearing for the development or modification of  standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Variances. The plan includes provisions for the granting of  permanent and temporary variances from State standards in terms  substantially similar to the variance provisions contained in the  Federal program. The State provisions require employee notification of  variance applications and   provide for employee participation in hearings held on variance  applications. Variances may not be granted unless it is established that  adequate protection is afforded employees under the terms of the  variance, and variances may have only future effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Employee notice and discrimination protection. The plan provides  for notification to employees of their protections and obligations under  the plan by such means as a State poster and required posting of notices  of violations. The plan also provides for protection of employees  against discharge or discrimination resulting from exercise of their  rights under the State's Act in terms essentially identical to section  11(c) of the OSH Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Inspections and enforcement. The plan provides for inspection of  covered workplaces, including inspections in response to employee  complaints. If a determination is made that an employee complaint does  not warrant an inspection, the complainant shall be notified, in  writing, of such determination and afforded an opportunity to seek  informal review of the determination. The plan provides the opportunity  for employer and employee representatives to accompany the inspector  during an inspection for the purpose of aiding in the inspection. The  plan also provides for right of entry for inspection and a prohibition  of advance notice of inspection. In lieu of first-instance monetary  sanctions for violations, the plan establishes a system for compelling  compliance under which public employers are issued notices of violation  and orders to comply. Such notices fix a reasonable period of time for  compliance. If compliance is not achieved by the time of a follow-up  inspection, daily failure-to-abate penalties of up to $50 for non- serious violations and up to $200 for serious violations, will be  proposed. The Commissioner of Labor may seek judicial enforcement of  orders to comply by commencing a proceeding pursuant to Article 78 of  the New York Civil Practice Law. In addition, the plan provides for  expedited judicial enforcement when non-compliance is limited to non- payment of penalties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Review procedures. Under the plan, public employers and  employees may seek formal administrative review of New York Department  of Labor citations, including penalties and the reasonableness of the  abatement periods, by petitioning the New York Industrial Board of  Appeals (IBA) no later than 60 days after the issuance of the citation.  The IBA is the independent State agency authorized by section 27-a(6)(c)  of the New York Act to consider petitions from affected parties for  review of the Commissioner of Labor's determinations. A contest does not  automatically stay a notice of violation, penalty or abatement date; a  stay must be granted from the IBA. Judicial review of any decision of  the IBA may be sought pursuant to Article 78 of the New York Civil  Practice Law. Prior to contest, employers, employees and other affected  parties may seek informal review of citations, penalties and abatement  dates by the Department of Labor by requesting an informal conference in  writing within 20 working days from the receipt of citation. If the  informal conference does not produce agreement, the affected party may  seek formal administrative review with the IBA. Public employees or  their authorized representatives have the additional right under 12  NYCRR Part 805 to contest the abatement period by filing a petition with  the Commissioner within 15 working days of the posting of the citation  by filing a petition with the Department of Labor, or later if good  cause for late filing is shown. If the Commissioner denies the employee  contest of abatement period under Part 805 in whole or in part, the  complaint will automatically be forwarded to the IBA for review. Under  the IBA rules, public employees or their representatives may request  permission to participate in an employer-initiated review process as  ``intervenors.'' The plan includes an April 28, 2006, assurance that  should an employee or employee representative request intervenor status  in an employer-initiated case, the State will appropriately inform the  IBA of its support for the request. Should an employee's or employee  representative's request for participation be denied, the State will  seek immediate corrective action to guarantee the right to employee  party status in employer-initiated cases. The   period fixed in the plan for contesting notices of violation is 60  calendar days, which is significantly longer than the 15 working day  period allowed under the Federal OSHA program. However, New York has  provided assurance, by Counsel's opinion of March 3, 1984, that it has  the authority under Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law to  obtain judicial enforcement of an uncontested order to comply upon  expiration of the abatement period, regardless of whether the 60 day  contest period has expired. New York has also assured that should the  State Labor Department's interpretation be successfully challenged,  appropriate legislative correction would be sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Staffing and resources. The plan as revised April 28, 2006,  provides assurances of a fully trained, adequate staff, including 29  safety and 21 health compliance officers for enforcement inspections and  11 safety and 9 health consultants to perform consultation services in  the public sector. The State has also given satisfactory assurances of  continued adequate funding to support the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Records and reports. The plan provides that public employers in  New York will maintain appropriate records and make timely reports on  occupational injuries and illnesses in a manner substantially identical  to that required for private sector employers under Federal OSHA. New  York has assured that it will continue its participation in the Bureau  of Labor Statistics Annual Survey of Injuries and Illnesses in the  public sector. The plan also contains assurances that the Commissioner  of Labor will provide reports to OSHA in such form as the Assistant  Secretary may require, and that New York will participate in OSHA's  Integrated Management Information System.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Voluntary compliance programs. The plan provides for training  for public employers and employees; seminars to familiarize affected  public employers and employees with applicable standards, requirements  and safe work practices; and an on-site consultation program in the  public sector to provide services to public employers upon request.
