                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirements. Sealed sources installed after July 1, 1993:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must have a certificate of registration issued under 10 CFR 32.210;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must be doubly encapsulated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Must use radioactive material that is as nondispersible as practical and that is as insoluble as practical if the source is used in a wet-source-storage or wet-source-change irradiator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Must be encapsulated in a material resistant to general corrosion and to localized corrosion, such as 316L stainless steel or other material with equivalent resistance if the sources are for use in irradiator pools; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In prototype testing of the sealed source, must have been leak tested and found leak-free after each of the tests described in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Temperature. The test source must be held at -40 [deg]C for 20 minutes, 600 [deg]C for 1 hour, and then be subjected to a thermal shock test with a temperature drop from 600 [deg]C to 20 [deg]C within 15 seconds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pressure. The test source must be twice subjected for at least 5 minutes to an external pressure (absolute) of 2 million newtons per square meter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Impact. A 2-kilogram steel weight, 2.5 centimeters in diameter, must be dropped from a height of 1 meter onto the test source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Vibration. The test source must be subjected 3 times for 10 minutes each to vibrations sweeping from 25 hertz to 500 hertz with a peak amplitude of 5 times the acceleration of gravity. In addition, each test source must be vibrated for 30 minutes at each resonant frequency found.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Puncture. A 50-gram weight and pin, 0.3-centimeter pin diameter, must be dropped from a height of 1 meter onto the test source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Bend. If the length of the source is more than 15 times larger than the minimum cross-sectional dimension, the test source must be subjected to a force of 2000 newtons at its center equidistant from two support cylinders, the distance between which is 10 times the minimum cross-sectional dimension of the source.</p>
