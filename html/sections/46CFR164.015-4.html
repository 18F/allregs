The density of the material shall be determined by dividing the weight of the material by its volume and shall be expressed in pounds per cubic foot. The volume shall be determined by measuring the volume of water displaced by the material or by direct measurement of the specimen using vernier calipers reading to 0.001 inch A sheet specimen 4 x 4 x thickness furnished shall be used unless the foam is molded shape, then the largest single piece so molded shall be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Buoyancy in fresh water--(1) Specimens. The buoyancy test shall be made with a sample of the sheet material measuring 12 x 12 x thickness of material furnished or with the largest molded shape furnished.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specimens. The buoyancy test shall be made with a sample of the sheet material measuring 12 x 12 x thickness of material furnished or with the largest molded shape furnished.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedure. Securely attach a spring scale in a position directly over a test tank. Suspend a weighted wire

basket from the scale in such a manner that the basket can be weighed while completely submerged in water. Proceed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Weigh the empty basket under water.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Place the sample inside the basket and submerge it so that the top of the basket is at least 2 inches below the surface of the water. Allow the samples to remain submerged for 24 hours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After 24 hours submergence period, weigh the wire basket with the sample inside while both are still under water.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The buoyancy is computed as paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section minus (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The resulting value is divided by the volume of the polyvinyl chloride foam expressed in cubic feet. The final result is in lbs./cu. ft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Volume loss on heat aging--(1) Specimen. Test specimens shall consist of pieces 4 x 4 x the thickness of the material furnished. Where the foam is an object of molded shape, the largest single piece so molded shall be used for this test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specimen. Test specimens shall consist of pieces 4 x 4 x the thickness of the material furnished. Where the foam is an object of molded shape, the largest single piece so molded shall be used for this test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedure. Volume before and after the heat aging test shall be determined by measuring the volume of water displaced by the material. The specimens shall be placed in an oven maintained at 140[deg] 2 [deg]F., for a period of one week. At the end of that period the specimens shall be removed from the oven and allowed to recover in the open for 5 hours at 70[deg] 2 [deg]F. before the measurement of final volume is made. The test shall be run in triplicate, the results averaged and the percentage of volume loss calculated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Compression deflection. Compression deflection shall be determined in accordance with method 12151 of Federal Standard 601, except that the deflection shall be maintained at 25 percent with automatic or manual control, and the load observed and recorded 60 seconds after the 25 percent deflection is reached.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Compression set--(1) Specimens. The specimens shall have parallel top and bottom surfaces which shall be at right angles to the side surfaces. The specimen may be cylindrical or rectangular. The minimum dimension across the top shall be at least 1.0 times the thickness and the top a minimum of 1 square inch in area, and a maximum of 16 square inches in area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specimens. The specimens shall have parallel top and bottom surfaces which shall be at right angles to the side surfaces. The specimen may be cylindrical or rectangular. The minimum dimension across the top shall be at least 1.0 times the thickness and the top a minimum of 1 square inch in area, and a maximum of 16 square inches in area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Apparatus. The apparatus shall consist of a compression device with two parallel plates, between which the test specimen shall be compressed by means of four studs and nuts. The plates may be steel, aluminum or any rigid smooth metal of sufficient thickness to withstand the required compression stresses without bending. The surfaces against which the test specimens are held shall be smooth and shall be thoroughly cleaned and wiped dry before each test. Metal shims inserted between the plates shall be used to limit the compression of the specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedure. Thickness, before and after the compression set test shall be measured as specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. The test specimens shall be compressed 25% of the original thickness for 22 hours. At the end of that period, the test specimens shall be removed from the set apparatus and allowed to rest for 24 hours before measurement of final thickness is made. The compression set shall be calculated by means of the following formula:
Compression set (percent) = [(ho - hi) / (ho - hs)] x 100 (1)
where:
ho = the original thickness.hi = the thickness 24 hours after removal from apparatus.hs = the test compression thickness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Fire retardance--(1) Types A and C foams. The test specimens shall be \1/4\ inch in thickness, 1 inch in width and approximately 6 inches in length. The specimens shall be clamped at one end in a position such that the long dimension forms a 45[deg] angle with the horizontal and with the widths in a vertical position. A Bunsen burner with a 1 inch yellow flame shall be applied to the lower or free end of the specimen for 15 seconds. The burner shall then be removed and the time that the specimen continues to burn after removal of the burner shall be recorded as burning time. The length of char shall also be recorded. The test shall be performed

in a location free from drafts. The average results of three determinations shall be reported. A plain wax candle equivalent to those meeting Federal Specification C-C 91 may be substituted for the Bunsen burner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Types A and C foams.

(i) The tensile strength of the specimens shall be determined in a standard tensile testing machine with a rate of separation of jaws set at 2 inches per minute. The bench marks shall be followed with a suitable pair of dividers until the specimen ruptures. A minimum of 4 specimens shall be tested and if any specimen breaks at the clamp or any specimen exhibits any obvious defects, the results obtained therewith shall be discarded. A new similar specimen shall then be prepared and tested. The tensile strength shall be calculated by dividing the breaking load (to the nearest 0.1 pound) by the original area of the cross section of the specimen in square inches and the result shall be expressed in pounds per square inch. The percent ultimate elongation shall be calculated as follows:
D1 - D / D x 100 (2)
where:
D = distance between knife edges of bench marker.D1 = distance between bench marks at moment of rupture to the</p><p class="depth3">nearest \1/32\ inch.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Averaging determinations. The tensile strength in pounds per square inch and percent ultimate elongation of four determinations shall be averaged for each sample.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Water absorption--(1) Specimens.
