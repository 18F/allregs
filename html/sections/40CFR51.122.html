Data collection is to begin during the ozone season 1 year prior to the state's NOX SIP Call compliance date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The state shall report emissions as point sources according to the point source emissions thresholds of the Air Emissions Reporting Rule (AERR), 40 CFR part 51, subpart A. The detail of the emissions inventory shall be consistent with the data elements required by 40 CFR part 51, subpart A. When submitting a formal NOX Budget Emissions Report and associated data, states shall notify the appropriate EPA Regional Office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The state shall report emissions as point sources according to the point source emissions thresholds of the Air Emissions Reporting Rule (AERR), 40 CFR part 51, subpart A.
