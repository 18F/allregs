Private carrier systems licensed on other channels prior to  June 1, 1990, may continue to provide radio communications service to  eligibles. Rules as to eligibility for licensing, frequencies available,  permissible communications and classes and number of stations, and any  special requirements are set forth in the following sections.</p>
