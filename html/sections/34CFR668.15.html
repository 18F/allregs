                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. To begin and to continue to participate in any Title IV, HEA program, an institution must demonstrate to the Secretary that the institution is financially responsible under the requirements established in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General standards of financial responsibility. In general, the Secretary considers an institution to be financially responsible only if it--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is providing the services described in its official publications and statements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is providing the administrative resources necessary to comply with the requirements of this subpart;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is meeting all of its financial obligations, including but not limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Refunds that it is required to make; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Is current in its debt payments. The institution is not considered current in its debt payments if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The institution is in violation of any existing loan agreement at its fiscal year end, as disclosed in a note to its audited financial statement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> the institution fails to make a payment in accordance with existing debt obligations for more than 120 days, and at least one creditor has filed suit to recover those funds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary, submits to the Secretary an irrevocable letter of credit, acceptable

and payable to the Secretary equal to 25 percent of the total dollar amount of Title IV, HEA program refunds paid by the institution in the previous fiscal year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Has not had, as part of the audit report for the institution's most recently completed fiscal year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement by the accountant expressing substantial doubt about the institution's ability to continue as a going concern; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A disclaimed or adverse opinion by the accountant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> For a for-profit institution--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em> Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, an acid test ratio of at least 1:1. For purposes of this section, the acid test ratio shall be calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities. The calculation of the acid test ratio shall exclude all unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, an acid test ratio of at least 1:1. For purposes of this section, the acid test ratio shall be calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities. The calculation of the acid test ratio shall exclude all unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has not had operating losses in either or both of its two latest fiscal years that in sum result in a decrease in tangible net worth in excess of 10 percent of the institution's tangible net worth at the beginning of the first year of the two-year period. The Secretary may calculate an operating loss for an institution by excluding from net income: extraordinary gains or losses; income or losses from discontinued operations; prior period adjustment; and, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle. For purposes of this section, the calculation of tangible net worth shall exclude all assets defined as intangible in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Had, for its latest fiscal year, a positive tangible net worth. In applying this standard, a positive tangible net worth occurs when the institution's tangible assets exceed its liabilities. The calculation of tangible net worth shall exclude all assets classified as intangible in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has currently issued and outstanding debt obligations that are (without insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement) listed at or above the second highest rating level of credit quality given by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> For a nonprofit institution--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em> Prepares a classified statement of financial position in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or provides the required information in notes to the audited financial statements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Prepares a classified statement of financial position in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or provides the required information in notes to the audited financial statements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, an acid test ratio of at least 1:1. For purposes of this section, the acid test ratio shall be calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities. The calculation of the acid test ratio shall exclude all unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)(1)</em> Has, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a positive unrestricted current fund balance or positive unrestricted net assets. In calculating the unrestricted current fund balance or the unrestricted net assets for an institution, the Secretary may include funds that are temporarily restricted in use by the institution's governing body that can be transferred to the current unrestricted fund or added to net unrestricted assets at the discretion of the governing body; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Has not had, an excess of current fund expenditures over current fund revenues over both of its 2 latest fiscal years that results in a decrease exceeding 10 percent in either the unrestricted current fund balance or the unrestricted net assets at the beginning of the first year of the 2-year period. The Secretary may exclude from net changes in fund balances for the operating loss calculation: Extraordinary gains or losses; income or losses from discontinued operations; prior period adjustment; and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle. In calculating the institution's unrestricted current fund balance or the unrestricted net assets, the Secretary may include funds that are temporarily restricted in use by the institution's governing body that can be transferred to the current unrestricted

fund or added to net unrestricted assets at the discretion of the governing body; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has currently issued and outstanding debt obligations which are (without insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement) listed at or above the second highest rating level of credit quality given by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> For a public institution--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Has its liabilities backed by the full faith and credit of a State, or by an equivalent governmental entity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has a positive current unrestricted fund balance if reporting under the Single Audit Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Has a positive unrestricted current fund in the State's Higher Education Fund, as presented in the general purpose financial statements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Submits to the Secretary, a statement from the State Auditor General that the institution has, during the past year, met all of its financial obligations, and that the institution continues to have sufficient resources to meet all of its financial obligations; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has currently issued and outstanding debt obligations which are (without insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement) listed at or above the second highest rating level of credit quality given by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Past performance of an institution or persons affiliated with an institution.
