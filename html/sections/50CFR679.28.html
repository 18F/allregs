The vessel owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section unless the vessel owner or operator has requested, and NMFS has approved, one of the monitoring options described at paragraph (i)(1)(ii) or (i)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Bin monitoring standards. The vessel owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section unless the vessel owner or operator has requested, and NMFS has approved, one of the monitoring options described at paragraph (i)(1)(ii) or (i)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Option 1--No crew in bin or tank. No crew may enter any bin or tank preceding the point where the observer samples unsorted catch, unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The flow of fish has been stopped between the tank and the location where the observer samples unsorted catch;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All catch has been cleared from all locations between the tank and the location where the observer samples unsorted catch;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The observer has been given notice that the vessel crew must enter the tank; and either</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The observer is given the opportunity to observe the activities of the person(s) in the tank; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The observer informs the vessel operator, or his designee, that all sampling has been completed for a given haul, in which case crew may enter a tank containing fish from that haul without stopping the flow of fish or clearing catch between the tank and the observer sampling station.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Option 2--Line of sight option. From the observer sampling station, the location where the observer sorts and weighs samples, and the location from which the observer collects unsorted catch, an observer of average height (between 64 and 74 inches (140 and 160 cm)) must be able to see all areas of the bin or tank where crew could be located preceding the point where the observer samples catch. The observer must be able to view the activities of crew in the bin from these locations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Option 3--Video monitoring system option. A vessel owner and operator must provide and maintain a NMFS-approved video monitoring system as specified in paragraph (e) of this section. Additionally, the vessel owner and operator must ensure that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All periods when fish are inside the bin are recorded and stored;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The system provides sufficient resolution and field of view to see and read a text sample written in 130 point type (corresponding to line two of a standard Snellen eye chart) from any location within the tank where crew could be located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Failure of line of sight or video option. If the observer determines that a monitoring option selected by a vessel owner or operator specified in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) or (i)(1)(iii) of this section fails to provide adequate monitoring of all areas of the bin where crew could be located, then the vessel must use the monitoring option specified in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section until the observer determines that adequate monitoring of all areas of the bin where crew could be located is provided by the monitoring option selected by the vessel owner or operator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Who must have a bin monitoring option inspection? A vessel owner or operator choosing to operate under the line of sight option (option 2) in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section or the video option (option 3) in paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section must receive an annual bin monitoring option inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> How does a vessel owner arrange for a bin monitoring option inspection? The owner must submit an Inspection Request for Bin Monitoring to NMFS with all the information fields filled in at least 10 working days in advance of the requested date of inspection. The request form is available on the NMFS Alaska Region Web site (http://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where will bin monitoring option inspections be conducted? Inspections will be conducted on vessels tied to docks at Dutch Harbor, Alaska, Kodiak, Alaska, and in the Puget Sound area of Washington State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Bin monitoring option inspection report. A bin monitoring option inspection report, valid for 12 months from the date it is signed by NMFS, will be issued to the vessel owner if the bin monitoring option meets the requirements of paragraph (i)(1)(ii) or (i)(1)(iii) of this section. The vessel owner must maintain a current bin option inspection report onboard the vessel at all times the vessel is required to provide an approved bin monitoring option under this paragraph (i)(5). The bin monitoring option inspection report must be made available to the observer, NMFS personnel or to an authorized officer upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Video monitoring on catcher/processors and motherships in the BS pollock fishery, including pollock CDQ. The owner and operator of a catcher/processor or a mothership must provide and maintain a video monitoring system approved under paragraph (e) of this section. These video monitoring system requirements must be met when

the catcher/processor is directed fishing for pollock in the BS, including pollock CDQ, and when the mothership is taking deliveries from catcher vessels directed fishing for pollock in the BS, including pollock CDQ. Additionally, the system must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Record and retain video for all periods when fish are flowing past the sorting area or salmon are in the storage container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The system must provide sufficient resolution and field of view to observe all areas where salmon are sorted from the catch, all crew actions in these areas, and discern individual fish in the salmon storage container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Video monitoring in the longline catcher/processor subsector. The owner and operator of a catcher/processor subject to Sec. 679.100(b)(2) must provide and maintain a video monitoring system approved under paragraph (e) of this section. These video monitoring system requirements must be met when the vessel is operating in either the BSAI or GOA groundfish fisheries when directed fishing for Pacific cod is open in the BSAI, or while the vessel is groundfish CDQ fishing. Additionally, the system must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Record and retain video for all periods when Pacific cod are being sorted and weighed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provide sufficient resolution and field of view to monitor all areas where Pacific cod are sorted from the catch, all fish passing over the motion-compensated scale, and all crew actions in these areas.
