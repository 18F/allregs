                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part prescribes regulations in accordance with section  4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101-380), as  amended by section 711 of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010  (Pub. L. 111-281). The regulations will reduce the risk of oil spills  from laden, single hull and double hull tankers over 5,000 GT by  requiring that these tankers be escorted by at least two suitable escort  vessels in applicable waters, as defined in Sec. 168.40. The escort  vessels will be immediately available to influence the tankers' speed  and course in the event of a steering or propulsion equipment failure,  thereby reducing the possibility of groundings or collisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The regulations in this part establish minimum escort vessel  requirements. Nothing in these regulations should be construed as  relieving the master of a tanker from the duty to operate the vessel in  a safe and prudent manner, taking into account the navigational  constraints of the waterways to be traversed, other vessel traffic, and  anticipated weather, tide, and sea conditions, which may require reduced  speeds, greater assistance from escort vessels, or other operational  precautions.
