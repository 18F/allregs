The list of Air Force-approved CATEXs is in  appendix B. Supplements to this part may not add CATEXs or expand the  scope of the CATEXs in appendix B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Characteristics of categories of actions that usually do not  require either an EIS or an EA (in the absence of extraordinary  circumstances) include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Minimal adverse effect on environmental quality.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No significant change to existing environmental conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No significant cumulative environmental impact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Socioeconomic effects only.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Similarity to actions previously assessed and found to have no  significant environmental impacts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CATEXs apply to actions in the United States and abroad. General  exemptions specific to actions abroad are in 32 CFR part 187. The EPF or  other decision-maker forwards requests for additional exemption  determinations for actions abroad to HQ USAF/A7CI with a justification  letter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Normally, any decision-making level may determine the  applicability of a CATEX and need not formally record the determination  on AF Form 813 or elsewhere, except as noted in the CATEX list.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Application of a CATEX to an action does not eliminate the need  to meet air conformity requirements (see Sec. 989.30).
