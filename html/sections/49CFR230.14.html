                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. An individual competent to conduct the inspection shall  perform the 31 service day inspection after the steam locomotive has  accrued 31 service days. This inspection shall consist of all 31 service  day inspection items and all daily inspection items. See appendix A of  this part. Days in service shall be counted, recorded and readily  available for inspection when requested by an FRA inspector.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FRA notification. FRA Regional Administrators or their  delegate(s) may require a steam locomotive owner or operator to provide  FRA with timely notification before performing a 31 service day  inspection. If the Regional Administrator or their delegate indicates  their desire to be present for the 31 service day inspection, the steam  locomotive owner and/or operator shall provide them a scheduled date and  location for inspection. Once scheduled, the inspection must be  performed at the time and place specified, unless the Regional  Administrator and the steam locomotive owner and/or operator mutually  agree to reschedule. If the Regional Administrator requests the  inspection be performed on another date but the steam locomotive owner  and/or operator and the Regional Administrator are unable to agree on a  date for rescheduling, the inspection may be performed as scheduled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing inspection reports. Within 10 days of conducting the 31  service day inspection, the steam locomotive owner and/or operator shall  file, for   each steam locomotive inspected, a report of inspection (FRA Form No.  1), in the place where the steam locomotive is maintained and with the  FRA Regional Administrator for that region. When the report of annual  inspection (FRA Form No. 3), is filed, the FRA Form No. 1 does not have  to be filed until the next 31 service day inspection. (See appendix B of  this part.)</p>
