                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 48 CFR 1371.101, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Inspection and Manner of Doing Work (APR 2010)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All work and material shall be subject to the approval of the  Contracting Officer or duly authorized representative. Work shall be  performed in accordance with the plans and specifications of this  contract as modified by any contract modification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise specifically provided for in the contract, all  operational practices of the contractor and all workmanship and  material, equipment and articles used in the performance of work shall  be in accordance with American Bureau of Shipping ``Rules for Building  and Classing Steel Vessels'', U.S. Coast Guard Marine Engineering  Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F), U.S.  Coast Guard Electrical Engineering Regulations (46 CFR Subchapter J),  and U.S. Public Health Service ``Handbook on Sanitation of Vessel  Construction'', in effect at the time of the contract award; and the  best commercial maritime practices, except where military specifications  are specified, in which case such standards of material and workmanship  shall be followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All material and workmanship shall be subject to inspection and  test at all times during the contractor's performance of the work to  determine their quality and suitability for the purpose intended and  compliance with the contract. In case any material or workmanship  furnished by the contractor is found to be defective prior to redelivery  of the vessel, or not in accordance with the requirements of the  contract, the Government shall have the right prior to redelivery of the  vessel to reject such material or workmanship, and to require its  correction or replacement by the contractor at the contractor's cost and  expense. This Government right is in addition to its rights under any  Guarantee clause in this contract. If the contractor fails to proceed  promptly with the replacement or correction of such material or  workmanship, as required by the Contracting Officer, the Government may,  by contract or otherwise, replace or correct such material or  workmanship and charge to the contractor the excess cost to the  Government. The contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection  system acceptable to the Government covering the work specified in the  contract. Records of all inspection work by the contractor shall be kept  complete and   available to the Government during the performance of the contract and  for a period of two (2) years after delivery of the vessel to the  Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No welding, including tack welding and brazing, shall be  permitted in connection with repairs, completions, alterations, or  addition to hulls, machinery or components of vessels unless the welder  is, at the time, qualified to the standards established by the U.S.  Coast Guard, the American Bureau of Shipping, or the Department of the  Navy. The welder's qualifications shall be appropriate for the  particular service application, filler material type, position of  welding, and welding process involved in the work being undertaken. A  welder may be required to re-qualify if the Contracting Officer believes  there is a reasonable doubt concerning the welder's ability. Welders'  qualifications for this purpose shall be governed by the U.S. Coast  Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR  Subchapter F). When a welding process other than manual shielded arc is  proposed or required, the contractor or fabricator shall submit  procedure qualification tests for approval prior to production welding.  Procedure qualification tests shall be conducted in accordance with the  United States Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material  Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The contractor shall exercise reasonable care to protect the  vessel from fire, and the contractor shall maintain a reasonable system  of inspection over the activities of welders, burners, riveters,  painters, plumbers and similar workers, particularly where such  activities are undertaken in the vicinity of the vessel's fuel oil  tanks, magazines or storerooms containing flammable material. A  reasonable number of hose lines shall be maintained by the contractor  ready for immediate use on the vessel at all times while the vessel is  berthed alongside the contractor's pier or in dry dock or on a marine  railway. All tanks or bilge areas under alteration or repair shall be  cleaned, washed, and steamed out or otherwise made safe by the  contractor if and to the extent necessary as required by good marine  practice or by current Occupational Safety and Health Administration  regulations. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) shall be  furnished with a ``gas free'' or ``safe for hot work'' or ``safe for  workers'' certificate before any hot work or entry is done. Unless  otherwise provided in this contract, the contractor shall at all times  maintain a reasonable fire watch about the vessel, including a fire  watch on the vessel while work is being performed thereon.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The contractor shall place proper safeguards and/or effect such  safety precautions as necessary, including suitable and sufficient  lighting, for the prevention of accidents or injury to persons or  property during the prosecution of work under this contract and/or from  time of receipt of the vessel until acceptance by the Government of the  work performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this contract, when the vessel  is in the custody of the contractor or in dry dock or on a marine  railway and the temperature becomes as low as 35 degrees Fahrenheit, the  contractor shall keep all pipelines, fixtures, traps, tanks, and other  receptacles on the vessel drained to avoid damage from freezing, or if  this is not practicable, the vessel shall be kept heated to prevent such  damage. The vessel's stern tube and propeller hubs shall be protected  from frost damage by applied heat through the use of a salamander or  other proper means, as approved by the COR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Whenever practicable, the work shall be performed in a manner  which does not interfere with the berthing and messing of personnel  attached to the vessel. The contractor shall ensure that assigned  personnel have access to the vessel at all times. It is understood that  such personnel will not interfere with the work or the contractor's  workers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The Government does not guarantee the correctness of the  dimensions, sizes, and shapes shown in any sketches, drawings, plans or  specifications prepared or furnished by the Government. Prior to  submitting an offer, it is the responsibility of the bidder/offeror to  verify the dimensions, sizes, and shapes in materials provided by the  Government. Where practical, the Government will make the vessel  available for inspection prior to bid opening or the date for receipt of  proposals. If the contractor, as a result of inspection or otherwise,  discovers any error in the sketches, drawings, plans or specifications,  it shall immediately inform the Contracting Officer of the error and  proceed in accord with instructions received from the Contracting  Officer. The Government is not liable for any claims or charges  resulting from additional work performed by the contractor as a result  of a patent ambiguity in the sketches, drawings, plans or specifications  that was not brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer. The  contractor shall be responsible for the correctness of the shape, sizes  and dimensions of parts furnished by the contractor under the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The contractor shall at all times keep the site of the work on  the vessel free from accumulation of waste material or rubbish caused by  contractor employees or the work, and at the completion of the work  shall remove all rubbish from and about the site of the work and shall  leave the work and its immediate vicinity ``broom-clean'' unless more  exactly specified in this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> While in drydock or on a marine railway, the contractor shall be  responsible for the closing, before the end of working hours, of all  valves and openings upon which work   is being done by its workers when such closing is practicable. The  contractor shall establish a list and keep the COR cognizant of the  closure status of all valves and openings upon which the contractor's  workers have been working.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Without additional expense to the Government, the contractor  shall employ specialty subcontractors where required by the  specifications or when necessary for satisfactory performance of the  work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise stated in the contract, the contractor shall  notify the COR at least 72 hours in advance:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to starting inspections or tests; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such notification shall be provided either verbally or in  writing at the discretion of the COR.</p><p class="depth3">(End of clause)  [75 FR 10570, Mar. 8, 2010; 75 FR 14496, Mar. 26, 2010]</p>
