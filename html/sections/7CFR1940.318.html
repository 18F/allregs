                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The first step for the preparer (as defined in Secs. 1940.302(i)  and 1940.316 of this subpart) is to examine Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-20 submitted by the applicant to  determine if it is complete, consistent, fully responsive to the items,  signed, and dated. If not, it will be returned to the applicant with a  request for necessary clarifications or additional data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Once adequate data has been obtained, the assessment will be  initiated in the format and manner described in exhibit H of this  subpart. In completing the assessment, appropriate experts from State  and Federal agencies, universities, local and private groups will be  contacted as necessary for their views. In so doing, the preparer should  communicate with these agencies or parties in the most appropriate and  expeditious manner possible, depending upon the seriousness of the  potential impacts and the need for formal documentation. Appropriate  experts must be contacted whenever required by a specific provision of  this subpart or whenever the preparer does not have sufficient data or  expertise available within FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 to adequately assess the degree of a potential impact or the  need for avoidance or mitigation. Comments from an expert must be  obtained in writing whenever required by a specific provision of this  subpart or the potential environmental   impact is either controversial, complex, major, or apparently major.  When correspondence is exchanged, it will be appended to the assessment.  Oral discussions should be documented in the manner indicated in exhibit  H of this subpart. On the other hand, there is no need for the preparer  to seek expert views outside of the Agency when there is no specific  requirement to do so and the preparer has sufficient expertise available  within FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to assess  the degree of the potential impact and the need for avoidance or  mitigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At the earliest possible stage in the assessment process, the  preparer will identify the Federal, State, and local parties which are  carrying out related activities, either planned or under way.  Discussions with the applicant and FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 staff familiar with the project area should assist in  this identification effort. If there is a potential for cumulative  impacts, the preparer will consult with the involved agencies to  determine the nature, timing and results of their environmental  analysis. These consultations will be documented in the assessment and  considered or adopted when making the environmental impact  determination. (See Sec. 1940.324 of this subpart concerning adoption of  assessments.) If it is determined that the cumulative impacts are  significant, the preparer will further contact the involved Federal  agencies and attempt to determine the lead Federal Agency as discussed  in Secs. 1940.320(b) and 1940.326 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Consultations similar to those discussed in paragraph (c) of  this section will also be undertaken with those Federal and State  agencies which are directly involved in the FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 action, either through the provision of  financial assistance or the review and approval of a necessary plan or  permit. For example, a construction permit from the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers may be required for a project. In such an instance, the  environmental assessment cannot be completed until the preparer has  either reviewed the other Agency's completed environmental analysis or  consulted with the other Agency and is reasonably sure of the scope,  content, and expected environmental impact determination of the  forthcoming analysis and has so documented for the FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 assessment this understanding. If the  other Agency believes that the project will have a significant impact, a  joint or lead impact statement will be prepared. If the other Agency  does not believe a significant impact will occur, the preparer will  consider this finding and its supporting analysis in completing the FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 environmental impact  determination. Guidance in adopting an environmental assessment prepared  by another Federal Agency is provided in Sec. 1940.324 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For actions having a variety of complex or interrelated impacts  that are difficult for the preparer to assess, consideration should be  given to holding a public meeting in the manner described in  Sec. 1940.331(c) of this subpart. Such meetings should not be assumed as  being limited to projects for which EISs are being prepared. Such a  meeting can serve a useful purpose in better defining and identifying  complex impacts, as well as locating expertise with respect to them. The  results of a public meeting and the follow-up from it can also serve as  a valuable tool in reaching an early understanding on the potential need  for an EIS. When identified impacts are difficult to quantify (such as  odor and visual and community impacts) or controversial, a public  information meeting should be held near the project site and the local  area's concern about it. Whenever held, it should be announced and  organized in the manner described in Sec. 1940.331(c). However, a  transcript of the meeting need not be prepared, but the preparer will  make detailed notes for incorporation in the assessment. (See  Sec. 1940.331(c) of this subpart.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Throughout this assessment process, the preparer will keep in  mind the criteria for determining a significant environmental impact. If  at any time in this process it is determined that a significant impact  would result, the preparer will so notify the approving   official. Those actions specified in Sec. 1940.320 of this subpart will  then be initiated, unless the approving official disagrees with the  preparer's recommended determination, in which case further review of  the determination may be required as explained in Sec. 1940.316 (b), (d)  and (e) of this subpart. As soon as possible after the need for an EIS  is determined, the applicant will also be advised of this in writing, as  well as reinformed of the limitations on its actions during the period  that the EIS is being completed. (See Sec. 1940.309(e) of this subpart.)  The applicant's failure to comply with these limitations will be  considered as grounds for postponement of further consideration of the  application until such problem is alleviated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Similarly, throughout the assessment process, consideration will  be given to incorporating mechanisms into the proposed action for  reducing, mitigating, or avoiding adverse impacts. Examples of such  mechanisms which are commonly referred to as mitigation measures include  the deletion, relocation, redesign or other modifications of the project  elements; the dedication of environmentally sensitive areas which would  otherwise be adversely affected by the action or its indirect impacts;  soil erosion and sedimentation plans to control runoff during land- disturbing activities; the establishment of vegetative buffer zones  between project sites and adjacent land uses; protective measures  recommended by environmental and conservation agencies, including but  not limited to interstate, international, Federal, State, area-wide, and  local agencies having jurisdiction or special expertise regarding the  action's impacts; and zoning. Mitigation measures must be tailored to  fit the specific needs of the action, and they must also be practical  and enforceable. Mitigation measures which will be taken must be  documented in the assessment (Item XIX of exhibit H of this subpart),  and include an analysis of their environmental impacts and potential  effectiveness and placed in the offer of financial assistance as special  conditions or in the implementation requirements when the action does  not involve financial assistance. These measures will be consistent with  the basic goal of the proposed action and developed in consultation with  the appropriate program office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> As part of the assessment process, the preparer will initiate  the consultation and compliance requirements for the environmental laws,  regulations, and Executive orders specified in the assessment format.  The assessment cannot be completed until compliance with these laws and  regulations is appropriately documented. The project's failure to meet  the requirements specified in Item 10b of Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-21 for a Class I action and Item  XXIb of exhibit H of this subpart for a Class II action will result in  postponement of further consideration of the application until such  problem is alleviated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> When the preparer has completed the assessment, the related  materials and correspondence utilized will be attached. The preparer  will then either recommend to the approving official that the action has  the potential for significantly affecting the quality of the human  environment or will recommend that the action does not have this  potential and, therefore, the preparation of an EIS is not necessary.  (Item 10a of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  1940-21 for Class I action and item XXIa of exhibit H of this subpart  for a Class II action.) The recommended environmental findings will also  be completed. (Item 10b of Form FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 1940-21 for a Class I action and Item XXIb of exhibit  H of this subpart for a Class II action.) In those instances specified  in Sec. 1940.316, the assessment will then be forwarded to the  concurring official and, as required, to the SEC for review. The  concurring official will coordinate, as necessary, with the preparer any  questions, concerns or clarifications and complete and document the  review prior to the assessment being submitted to the approving official  or the SEC. The SEC will coordinate with the concurring official in a  similar fashion whenever the latter's review is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The approving official will review the environmental file and  recommendations. The official will then execute the environmental impact  determination and findings. If the conclusions reached are that there is  no significant impact and there is compliance with the listed  requirements, the format contained in exhibit I of this subpart will be  used. If a significant impact is determined, the steps specified in  Sec. 1940.320 of this subpart will be initiated for the preparation of  the EIS. If a determination is made that the proposed action does not  comply with the environmental requirements that are explained in this  subpart and listed in Item 10b of Form FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 1940-21 for a Class I action or Item XXIb of  exhibit H of this subpart for a Class II action and there are no  feasible alternatives (practicable alternatives when required by  specific provisions of this subpart), modifications, or mitigation  measures which could comply, the action will be denied or disapproved.  If the approving official's determination or findings differ from the  recommendations of the preparer, concurring official or the SEC, this  difference will be addressed in the manner specified in Sec. 1940.316 of  this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> When there is no need for further review as discussed in  paragraph (j) of this section and findings of compliance and a  determination of no significant impact are reached, the assessment  process is conditionally concluded. To conclude the assessment, the  applicant will then be requested to provide public notification of these  results as indicated in Sec. 1940.331(b)(3) of this subpart. The  approving official will not approve the pending application for at least  15 days from the date the notification is last published. If comments  are received as a result of the notification, they will be included in  the environmental assessment and considered. Any necessary changes  resulting from this consideration will be made in the assessment, impact  determinations, and findings. If the changes require further  implementation steps, such as the preparation of an EIS, they will be  undertaken. If there are no changes in the findings and determination  steps, such as the preparation of an EIS, they will be undertaken. If  there are no changes in the findings and determinations, the approving  official may continue to process the application. The environmental  documents, i.e., the assessment, related correspondence, Form FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-20, and the finding  of no significant impact will be included with the approval documents  which are assembled for review and clearance within the approving  office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Whenever changes are made to an action or comments or new or  changed information relating to the action's potential environmental  effects is received after the assessment is completed but prior to the  action's approval, such change, comment, or information will be  evaluated by the approving official to determine the impact on the  completed assessment. Whenever the contents or findings of that  assessment are affected, the assessment process for that action will be  revised and any other related requirement of this subpart met. Changes  to an action in terms of its location(s), design, purpose, or operation  will normally require, at a minimum, modification of the original  assessment to reflect such change(s) and the associated environmental  impacts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> When comments are received after the action has been approved,  the approving official will consider the environmental importance of the  comments and the necessity and ability to amend both the action, with  respect to the issue raised and the action's stage of implementation.  The National Office may be consulted to assist in determining whether  there are any remaining environmental requirements which need to be met  under the specific circumstances. A similar procedure will be followed  when new or changed information is received after project approval.  Amendments and revisions to actions will be handled as specified in  Secs. 1940.310 through 1940.313 of this subpart.</p>
