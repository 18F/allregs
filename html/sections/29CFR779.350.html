If the establishment is a service establishment, it must  qualify under section 13(a)(2) in order to be exempt. A retail  establishment selling goods, however, also may perform services  incidental or necessary to the sale of such goods, such as a delivery  service by a bakery store or installation of antennas by a radio dealer  for his customers, without affecting the character of the establishment  as a retail establishment qualified for exemption under section  13(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0">Engaging in Contract Telegraph Agency Operations; Section 13(a)(11)</p>
