                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Calculating the numerator and denominator for single-family housing goals. Performance under each of the single-family housing goals shall be measured using a fraction that is converted into a percentage. Neither the numerator nor the denominator shall include Enterprise transactions or activities that are not mortgage purchases as defined by FHFA or that are specifically excluded as ineligible under Sec.  1282.16(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The numerator. The numerator of each fraction is the number of mortgage purchases of an Enterprise in a particular year that finance owner-occupied single-family properties that count toward achievement of a particular single-family housing goal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The denominator. The denominator of each fraction is the total number of mortgage purchases of an Enterprise in a particular year that finance owner-occupied single-family properties. A separate denominator shall be calculated for purchase money mortgages and for refinancing mortgages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Counting owner-occupied units. (1) Mortgage purchases financing owner-occupied single-family properties shall be evaluated based on the income of the mortgagors and the area median income at the time the mortgage was originated. To determine whether mortgages may be counted under a particular family income level, i.e., low- or very low-income, the income of the mortgagors is compared to the median income for the area at the time the mortgage was originated, using the appropriate percentage factor provided under Sec.  1282.17.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mortgage purchases financing owner-occupied single-family properties for which the income of the mortgagors is not available shall be included in the denominator for the single-family housing goals and subgoal, but such mortgages shall not be counted in the numerator of any single-family housing goal or subgoal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Counting dwelling units for multifamily housing goal and subgoals. Performance under the multifamily housing goal and subgoals shall be measured by counting the number of dwelling units that count toward achievement of a particular housing goal or subgoal in all multifamily properties financed by mortgages purchased by an Enterprise in a particular year. Only dwelling units that are financed by mortgage purchases, as defined by FHFA, and that are not specifically excluded as ineligible under Sec.  1282.16(b), may be counted for purposes of the multifamily housing goal and subgoals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Counting rental units--(1) Use of rent. For purposes of counting rental units toward achievement of the multifamily housing goal and subgoals, mortgage purchases financing such units shall be evaluated based on rent and whether the rent is affordable to

the income group targeted by the housing goal and subgoals. A rent is affordable if the rent does not exceed the maximum levels as provided in Sec.  1282.19.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Affordability of rents based on housing program requirements. Where a multifamily property is subject to an affordability restriction under a housing program that establishes the maximum permitted income level for a tenant or a prospective tenant or the maximum permitted rent, the affordability of units in the property may be determined based on the maximum permitted income level or maximum permitted rent established under such housing program for those units. If using income, the maximum income level must be no greater than the maximum income level for each goal, adjusted for family or unit size as provided in Sec.  1282.17 or Sec.  1282.18, as appropriate. If using rent, the maximum rent level must be no greater than the maximum rent level for each goal, adjusted for unit size as provided in Sec.  1282.19.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Unoccupied units. Anticipated rent for unoccupied units may be the market rent for similar units in the neighborhood as determined by the lender or appraiser for underwriting purposes. A unit in a multifamily property that is unoccupied because it is being used as a model unit or rental office may be counted for purposes of the multifamily housing goal and subgoals only if an Enterprise determines that the number of such units is reasonable and minimal considering the size of the multifamily property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Timeliness of information. In evaluating affordability under the multifamily housing goal and subgoals, each Enterprise shall use tenant and rental information as of the time of mortgage acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Missing data or information for multifamily housing goal and subgoals. (1) Rental units for which bedroom data are missing shall be considered efficiencies for purposes of calculating unit affordability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When an Enterprise lacks sufficient information to determine whether a rental unit in a property securing a multifamily mortgage purchased by an Enterprise counts toward achievement of the multifamily housing goal or subgoals because rental data is not available, an Enterprise's performance with respect to such unit may be evaluated using estimated affordability information by multiplying the number of rental units with missing affordability information in properties securing multifamily mortgages purchased by the Enterprise in each census tract by the percentage of all rental dwelling units in the respective tracts that would count toward achievement of each goal and subgoal, as determined by FHFA based on the most recent decennial census.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The estimation methodology in paragraph (e)(2) of this section may be used up to a nationwide maximum of 5 percent of the total number of rental units in properties securing multifamily mortgages purchased by the Enterprise in the current year. Multifamily rental units in excess of this maximum, and any units for which estimation information is not available, shall not be counted for purposes of the multifamily housing goal and subgoals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Credit toward multiple goals. A mortgage purchase (or dwelling unit financed by such purchase) by an Enterprise in a particular year shall count toward the achievement of each housing goal for which such purchase (or dwelling unit) qualifies in that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Application of median income. (1) For purposes of determining an area's median income under Sec. Sec.  1282.17 through 1282.19 and the definitions in Sec.  1282.1, the area is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The metropolitan area, if the property which is the subject of the mortgage is in a metropolitan area; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In all other areas, the county in which the property is located, except that where the State non-metropolitan median income is higher than the county's median income, the area is the State non-metropolitan area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When an Enterprise cannot precisely determine whether a mortgage is on dwelling unit(s) located in one area, the Enterprise shall determine the median income for the split area in the manner prescribed by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council for reporting under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (12 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.), if the Enterprise can determine

that the mortgage is on dwelling unit(s) located in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A census tract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A census place code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Sampling not permitted. Performance under the housing goals for each year shall be based on a complete tabulation of mortgage purchases (or dwelling units) for that year; a sampling of such purchases (or dwelling units) is not acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Newly available data. When an Enterprise uses data to determine whether a mortgage purchase (or dwelling unit) counts toward achievement of any goal and new data is released after the start of a calendar quarter, the Enterprise need not use the new data until the start of the following quarter.
