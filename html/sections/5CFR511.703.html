A retroactive effective date may be required only  if the employee is wrongfully demoted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Downgrading. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The effective date of a classification  appellate certificate or agency appellate decision can be retroactive  only if it corrects a classification action which resulted in a loss of  grade or pay. In order for the decision to be made retroactive, the  employee must file the initial request for review with either the agency  or the Office not later than 15 calendar days after the effective date  of the reclassification action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> However, if the appellate decision raises the grade of the  position above the original grade, retroactivity will apply only to the  extent of restoration to the original grade.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The right to a retroactive effective date provided by this  section is preserved on subsequent appeals from an agency or Office  classification decision when the subsequent appeal is filed not later  than 15 calendar days following receipt of written notification of a  final agency administrative decision or 15 calendar days after the  effective date of the action taken as a result of the classification  decision, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Grade change based on new duties and responsibilities.  Retroactivity may be based only on duties and responsibilities existing  at the time of demotion and cannot be based on duties and  responsibilities assigned later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Retroactivity when time limits are extended. The right to a  retroactive effective date provided by this section may be preserved at  the discretion of the Office, on a showing by the employee that he or  she was not notified of the applicable time limit and was not otherwise  aware of it, or that circumstances beyond his or her control prevented  filing an appeal within the prescribed time limit.</p>
