                                Sec. 318.12  Manufacture of dog food or similar uninspected article
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When dog food, or similar uninspected article is manufactured in an edible product department, there shall be sufficient space allotted and adequate equipment provided so that the manufacture of the uninspected article in no way interferes with the handling or preparation of edible products. Where necessary to avoid adulteration of edible products, separate equipment shall be provided for the uninspected article. To assure the maintenance of sanitary conditions in the edible product departments, the operations incident to the manufacture of the uninspected article will be subject to the same sanitary requirements that apply to all operations in edible product departments. The manufacture of the uninspected article shall be limited to those hours during which the establishment operates under inspectional supervision; and there shall be no handling, other than receiving at the official establishment, of any of the product ingredient of the uninspected article, other than during the regular hours of inspection. The materials used in the manufacture of the uninspected article shall not be used so as to interfere with the inspection of edible product or the maintenance of sanitary conditions in the department or render any edible product adulterated. The meat, meat byproducts, and meat food

product ingredients of the uninspected article may be admitted into any edible products department of an official establishment only if they are U.S. Inspected and Passed. Products within Sec. 314.11 of this subchapter or parts of carcasses of kinds not permitted under the regulations in this subchapter to be prepared for human food (e.g., lungs or intestines), which are produced at any official establishment, may be brought into the inedible products department of any official establishment for use in uninspected articles under this section. The uninspected article may be stored in, and distributed from, edible product departments: Provided, That adequate facilities are furnished, there is no interference with the maintenance of sanitary conditions, and such article is properly identified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When dog food or similar uninspected article is manufactured in a part of an official establishment other than an edible product department, the area in which the article is manufactured shall be separated from edible product departments in the manner required for separation between edible product departments and inedible product departments. Sufficient space must be allotted and adequate equipment provided so that the manufacture of the uninspected article does not interfere with the proper functioning of the other operations at the establishment. Except as provided in Sec. 314.11 of this subchapter, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as permitting any deviation from the requirement that dead animals, condemned products, and similar materials of whatever origin, must be placed in the inedible product rendering equipment, and without undue delay. The manufacture of the uninspected article must be such as not to interfere with the maintenance of general sanitary conditions on the premises, and it shall be subject to inspectional supervision similar to that exercised over other inedible product departments. There shall be no movement of any product from an inedible product department to any edible product department. Trucks, barrels, and other equipment shall be cleaned before being returned to edible product departments from inedible product departments. Unoffensive material prepared outside edible product departments may be stored in, and distributed from, edible product departments only if packaged in clean, properly identified, sealed containers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Animal food shall be distinguished from articles of human food, so as to avoid distribution of such animal food as human food. To accomplish this, such animal food shall be labeled or otherwise identified in accordance with Sec. 325.11(d) of this subchapter.
