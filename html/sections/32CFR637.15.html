A request may also be sent via an electronic message or electronic mail or media provided all elements of the DA Form 2805 are included in the request. Approvals will be obtained prior to the conduct of an examination. Telephonic requests, followed with written requests, may be used in emergencies. The requesting official will include the following data on every polygraph examination request for criminal investigations:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The offense, which formed the basis of the investigation, is punishable under Federal law or the UCMJ by death or confinement for a term of 1 year or more. Even though such an offense may be disposed of with a lesser penalty, the person may be given a polygraph examination to eliminate suspicion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The person to be examined has been interviewed and there is reasonable cause to believe that the person has knowledge of, or was involved in, the matter under investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consistent with the circumstances, data to be obtained by polygraph examination are needed for further conduct of the investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Investigation by other means has been as thorough as circumstances permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Examinee has been interviewed on all relevant subjects requested for testing and the polygraph examination is essential and timely.</p>
