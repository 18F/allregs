                            <p class="depth0">Personnel who are FAC-P/PM certified, at any level, meet the  requirements for FAC-COTR certification and are, therefore, not required  to obtain FAC-COTR certification to serve as a COTR for an HHS  acquisition. However, for those individuals serving as a Program or  Project Manager under a FAC-P/PM certification waiver--see 301.607-73,  the Contracting Officer shall ensure that the individual meets the  requirements of HHS' FAC-COTR program before delegating authority to  that individual to act as a COTR. See 301.605 for additional information  regarding the Contracting Officer's designation of a COTR.  [74 FR 62398, Nov. 27, 2009. Redesignated at 75 FR 21510, Apr. 26, 2010]</p>
