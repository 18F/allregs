This  discretionary authority will be applied in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon determining that a State shall be subject to a final 18(e)  determination, the Assistant Secretary shall notify the agency  designated by the State to administer its program, within the State of  his decision that the State's program, or a separable portion thereof,  shall be subject to a final 18(e) determination. The Assistant Secretary  shall give the State a   reasonable time, generally not less than 1 year, in which to meet the  criteria for an affirmative 18(e) determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Assistant Secretary shall also publish a notice in the  Federal Register outlining his reasons for not making an affirmative  18(e) determination at the time. The notice will also set forth the  reasonable time the State was granted to meet the criteria for an  affirmative 18(e) determination and set forth such conditions as the  Assistant Secretary deems proper for the continuation of the State's  plan or such portions subject to this action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State shall be afforded an opportunity to agree to the  conditions of the Assistant Secretary's decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon the expiration of the time granted to a State to meet the  criteria for an affirmative 18(e) determination under paragraph (d)(2)  of this section, the Assistant Secretary may initiate proceedings to  determine whether a State shall be granted an affirmative 18(e)  determination. The procedures outlined in this subpart shall be  applicable to any proceedings initiated under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3">Procedure for Reconsideration and Revocation of an Affirmative 18(e)</p><p class="depth3">Determination</p>
