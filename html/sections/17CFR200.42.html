Each participating Commission member shall report his or her vote to the Secretary, who shall record it in the Minute Record of the Commission. Any matter circulated for disposition pursuant to this subsection shall not be considered final until each Commission member has reported his or her vote to the Secretary or has reported to the Secretary that the Commissioner does not intend to participate in the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever any member of the Commission so requests, any matter circulated for disposition pursuant to Sec. 200.42(a) shall be withdrawn from circulation and scheduled instead for joint Commission deliberation.
