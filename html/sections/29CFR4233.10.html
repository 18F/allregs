PBGC will make a  determination on an application not later than 270 days after the date  such application is deemed completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Incomplete application. If the application is incomplete, PBGC  will issue a written notice to the plan sponsor describing the  information missing from the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Complete application. Upon making a determination that an  application is complete (i.e., the application includes all the  information specified in Secs. 4233.5 through 4233.9), PBGC will issue a  written notice to the plan sponsor. The date of the written notice will  mark the beginning of PBGC's 270-day review period under section  4233(a)(1) of ERISA, and the plan sponsor's 30-day notice period under  4233(a)(2) of ERISA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rule for coordinated applications for partition and  benefit suspension. For a plan requiring both partition and benefit  suspensions to remain solvent, PBGC's initial determination that a  partition application is complete will be conditioned on the plan  sponsor's filing of an application for benefit suspensions with Treasury  within 30 days after receiving written notice from PBGC under paragraph  (c) of this section. Such a plan is permitted, but not required, to  issue a combined notice under Sec. 4233.13(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Informal consultation. Nothing in this subsection precludes a  plan sponsor from contacting PBGC on an informal basis to discuss a  potential partition application.</p>
