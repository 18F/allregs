The provisions of this section do not supersede the Federal Plant Quarantine Act of 1912, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or any other applicable laws or regulations or the need to comply with applicable food and sanitary regulations of city, county, State or Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Compliance.

False representations to any agency of the United States on any matter within its jurisdiction, knowing it to be false, is a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 which provides for a fine or imprisonment or both.</p><p class="depth0">Exhibit A</p><p class="depth0">grade requirements for shelled filberts</p><p class="depth0">Filbert kernels or portions of filbert kernels shall meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Well dried and clean;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Free from foreign material, mold, rancidity, decay or insect injury; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Free from serious damage caused by serious shriveling, or other means.</p><p class="depth0">tolerances</p><p class="depth0">In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling the following tolerances, by weight, are permitted as specified:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For Foreign Material: 0.02 of one percent, for foreign material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For Defects: Five percent for kernels or portions of kernels which are below the requirements of this grade, including not more than the following: Two percent for mold, rancidity, decay or insect injury: Provided, That not more than one percent shall be for mold, rancidity, or insect injury.</p><p class="depth0">definitions</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Well dried means that the kernels are firm and crisp, not containing more than 6 percent moisture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Clean means practically free from plainly visible adhering dirt or other foreign material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Foreign material means any substance other than the filbert kernels, or portions of kernels.
