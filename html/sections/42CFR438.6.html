States must first establish actuarially sound capitation rates prior to making adjustments for GME.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> For CYs 2013 and 2014, and payments to an MCO, PIHP or PAHP for primary care services furnished to enrollees under part 447, subpart G, of this chapter, the contract must require that the MCO, PIHP or PAHP meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Make payments to those specified physicians (whether directly or through a capitated arrangement) at least equal to the amounts set forth and required under part 447, subpart G, of this chapter.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Provide documentation to the state, sufficient to enable the state and CMS to ensure that provider payments increase as required by paragraph (c)(5)(vi)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Enrollment discrimination prohibited.
