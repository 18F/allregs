For purposes of this section, the following  additional definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0">100 percent liquidity coverage means an amount equal to the  outstanding balance of all ABCP issued by the conduit plus any accrued  and unpaid interest without regard to the performance of the ABS  interests held by the ABCP conduit and without regard to any credit  enhancement.</p><p class="depth0">ABCP means asset-backed commercial paper that has a maturity at the  time of issuance not exceeding 397 days, exclusive of days of grace, or  any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited.</p><p class="depth0">ABCP conduit means an issuing entity with respect to ABCP.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible ABCP conduit means an ABCP conduit, provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The ABCP conduit is bankruptcy remote or otherwise isolated for  insolvency purposes from the sponsor of the ABCP conduit and from any  intermediate SPV;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The ABS interests acquired by the ABCP conduit are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ABS interests collateralized solely by assets originated by an  originator-seller and by servicing assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special units of beneficial interest (or similar ABS interests)  in a trust or special purpose vehicle that retains legal title to leased  property underlying leases originated by an originator-seller that were  transferred to an intermediate SPV in connection with a securitization  collateralized solely by such leases and by servicing assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> ABS interests in a revolving pool securitization  collateralized solely by assets originated by an originator-seller and  by servicing assets; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> ABS interests described in paragraph (2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of  this definition that are collateralized, in whole or in part, by assets  acquired by an originator-seller in a business combination that  qualifies for business combination accounting under GAAP, and, if  collateralized in part, the remainder of such assets are assets  described in paragraph (2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this definition; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Acquired by the ABCP conduit in an initial issuance by or on  behalf of an intermediate SPV:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Directly from the intermediate SPV,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> From an underwriter of the ABS interests issued by the  intermediate SPV, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> From another person who acquired the ABS interests directly from  the intermediate SPV;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The ABCP conduit is collateralized solely by ABS interests  acquired from intermediate SPVs as described in paragraph (2) of this  definition and servicing assets; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A regulated liquidity provider has entered into a legally  binding commitment to provide 100 percent liquidity coverage (in the  form of a lending facility, an asset purchase agreement, a repurchase  agreement, or other similar arrangement) to all the ABCP issued by the  ABCP conduit by lending to, purchasing ABCP issued by, or purchasing  assets from, the ABCP conduit in the event that funds are required to  repay maturing ABCP issued by the ABCP conduit. With respect to the 100  percent liquidity coverage, in the event that the ABCP conduit is unable  for any reason to repay maturing ABCP issued by the issuing entity, the  liquidity provider shall be obligated to pay an amount equal to any  shortfall, and the total amount that may be due pursuant to the 100  percent liquidity coverage shall be equal to 100 percent of the amount  of the ABCP outstanding at any time plus accrued and unpaid interest  (amounts due pursuant to the required liquidity coverage may not be  subject to credit performance of the ABS interests held by the ABCP  conduit or reduced by the amount of credit support provided to the ABCP  conduit and liquidity support that only funds performing loans or  receivables or performing ABS interests does not meet the requirements  of this section).</p><p class="depth0">Intermediate SPV means a special purpose vehicle that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is a direct or indirect wholly-owned affiliate of the  originator-seller; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has nominal equity owned by a trust or corporate service  provider that specializes in providing independent ownership of special  purpose vehicles, and such trust or corporate service provider is not  affiliated with any other transaction parties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is bankruptcy remote or otherwise isolated for insolvency  purposes from the eligible ABCP conduit and from each originator-seller  and each majority-owned affiliate in each case that, directly or  indirectly, sells or transfers assets to such intermediate SPV;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Acquires assets from the originator-seller that are originated  by the originator-seller or acquired by the originator-seller in the  acquisition of a business that qualifies for business combination  accounting under GAAP or acquires ABS interests issued by another  intermediate SPV of the originator-seller that are collateralized solely  by such assets; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Issues ABS interests collateralized solely by such assets, as  applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Originator-seller means an entity that originates assets and sells  or transfers those assets, directly or through a majority-owned  affiliate, to an intermediate SPV, and includes (except for the purposes  of identifying the sponsorship and affiliation of an intermediate SPV  pursuant to thisSec. 373.6) any affiliate of the originator-seller that,  directly or indirectly, majority controls, is majority controlled by or  is under   common majority control with, the originator-seller.

An ABCP conduit sponsor satisfies the risk retention  requirement of Sec. 373.3 with respect to the issuance of ABCP by an  eligible ABCP conduit in a securitization transaction if, for each ABS  interest the ABCP conduit acquires from an intermediate SPV:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An originator-seller of the intermediate SPV retains an economic  interest in the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the ABS  interest acquired by the eligible ABCP conduit in the amount and manner  required under Sec. 373.4 orSec. 373.5; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The ABCP conduit sponsor:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Approves each originator-seller permitted to sell or transfer  assets, directly or indirectly, to an intermediate SPV from which an  eligible ABCP conduit acquires ABS interests;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Approves each intermediate SPV from which an eligible ABCP  conduit is permitted to acquire ABS interests;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Establishes criteria governing the ABS interests, and the  securitized assets underlying the ABS interests, acquired by the ABCP  conduit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Administers the ABCP conduit by monitoring the ABS interests  acquired by the ABCP conduit and the assets supporting those ABS  interests, arranging for debt placement, compiling monthly reports, and  ensuring compliance with the ABCP conduit documents and with the ABCP  conduit's credit and investment policy; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Maintains and adheres to policies and procedures for ensuring  that the requirements in this paragraph (b) of this section have been  met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Originator-seller compliance with risk retention. The use of the  risk retention option provided in this section by an ABCP conduit  sponsor does not relieve the originator-seller that sponsors ABS  interests acquired by an eligible ABCP conduit from such originator- seller's obligation to comply with its own risk retention obligations  under this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Disclosures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Periodic disclosures to investors. An ABCP  conduit sponsor relying upon this section shall provide, or cause to be  provided, to each purchaser of ABCP, before or contemporaneously with  the first sale of ABCP to such purchaser and at least monthly  thereafter, to each holder of commercial paper issued by the ABCP  conduit, in writing, each of the following items of information, which  shall be as of a date not more than 60 days prior to date of first use  with investors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name and form of organization of the regulated liquidity  provider that provides liquidity coverage to the eligible ABCP conduit,  including a description of the material terms of such liquidity  coverage, and notice of any failure to fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to each ABS interest held by the ABCP conduit:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The asset class or brief description of the underlying  securitized assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The standard industrial category code (SIC Code) for the  originator-seller that will retain (or has retained) pursuant to this  section an interest in the securitization transaction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A description of the percentage amount of risk retention  pursuant to the rule by the originator-seller, and whether it is in the  form of an eligible horizontal residual interest, vertical   interest, or revolving pool securitization seller's interest, as  applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disclosures to regulators regarding originator-sellers. An ABCP  conduit sponsor relying upon this section shall provide, or cause to be  provided, upon request, to the Commission and its appropriate Federal  banking agency, if any, in writing, all of the information required to  be provided to investors in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and the  name and form of organization of each originator-seller that will retain  (or has retained) pursuant to this section an interest in the  securitization transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Sale or transfer of ABS interests between eligible ABCP  conduits. At any time, an eligible ABCP conduit that acquired an ABS  interest in accordance with the requirements set forth in this section  may transfer, and another eligible ABCP conduit may acquire, such ABS  interest, if the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The sponsors of both eligible ABCP conduits are in compliance  with this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The same regulated liquidity provider has entered into one or  more legally binding commitments to provide 100 percent liquidity  coverage to all the ABCP issued by both eligible ABCP conduits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Duty to comply. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The ABCP conduit sponsor shall be  responsible for compliance with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An ABCP conduit sponsor relying on this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Shall maintain and adhere to policies and procedures that are  reasonably designed to monitor compliance by each originator-seller  which is satisfying a risk retention obligation in respect of ABS  interests acquired by an eligible ABCP conduit with the requirements of  paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the event that the ABCP conduit sponsor determines that an  originator-seller no longer complies with the requirements of paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Promptly notify the holders of the ABCP, and upon request, the  Commission and its appropriate Federal banking agency, if any, in  writing of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section  and the amount of ABS interests issued by an intermediate SPV of such  originator-seller and held by the ABCP conduit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The name and form of organization of any originator-seller that  hedges, directly or indirectly through an intermediate SPV, its risk  retention in violation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the  amount of ABS interests issued by an intermediate SPV of such  originator-seller and held by the ABCP conduit; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any remedial actions taken by the ABCP conduit sponsor or other  party with respect to such ABS interests; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Take other appropriate steps pursuant to the requirements of  paragraphs (b)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section which may include, as  appropriate, curing any breach of the requirements in this section, or  removing from the eligible ABCP conduit any ABS interest that does not  comply with the requirements in this section.</p>
