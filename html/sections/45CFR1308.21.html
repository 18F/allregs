                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In addition to the many references to working with parents  throughout these standards, the staff must carry out the following  tasks:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Support parents of children with disabilities entering from  infant/toddler programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provide information to parents on how to foster the development  of their child with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Provide opportunities for parents to observe large group, small  group and individual activities describe in their child's IEP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provide follow-up assistance and activities to reinforce program  activities at home.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Refer parents to groups of parents of children with similar  disabilities who can provide helpful peer support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Inform parents of their rights under IDEA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Inform parents of resources which may be available to them from  the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Program, the Early and Periodic  Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) Program and other sources and  assist them with initial efforts to access such resources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Identify needs (caused by the disability) of siblings and other  family members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Provide information in order to prevent disabilities among  younger siblings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> build parent confidence, skill and knowledge in accessing  resources and advocating to meet the special needs of their children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Grantees must plan to assist parents in the transition of  children from Head Start to public school or other placement, beginning  early in the program year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Head Start grantees, in cooperation with the child's parents,  must notify the school of the child's planned enrollment prior to the  date of enrollment.    Sec. Appendix to Part 1308--Head Start Program Performance Standards on</p><p class="depth0">Services to Children With Disabilities</p><p class="depth0">This appendix sets forth guidance for the implementation of the  requirements in part 1308. This guidance provides explanatory material  and includes recommendations and suggestions for meeting the  requirements. This guidance is not binding on Head Start grantees or  delegate agencies. It provides assistance and possible strategies which  a grantee may wish to consider. In instances where a permissible course  of action is provided, the grantee or delegate agency may rely upon this  guidance or may take another course of action that meets the applicable  requirement. This programmatic guidance is included as an aid to  grantees because of the complexity of providing special services to meet  the needs of children with various disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1308.4 Purpose and scope of disabilities service plan</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0">In order to develop an effective disabilities service plan the  responsible staff members need to understand the context in which a  grantee operates. The Head Start program has operated under a  Congressional mandate, since 1972, to make available, at a minimum, ten  percent of its enrollment opportunities to children with disabilities.  Head Start has exceeded this mandate and serves children in integrated,  developmentally appropriate programs. The passage of the Individuals  With Disabilities Education Act, formerly the Education of the  Handicapped Act, and its amendments, affects Head Start, causing a shift  in the nature of Head Start's responsibilities for providing services  for children with disabilities relative to the responsibilities of State  Education Agencies (SEA) and Local Education Agencies (LEA).</p><p class="depth0">Grantees need to be aware that under the IDEA the State Education  Agency has the responsibility for assuring the availability of a free  appropriate public education for all children with disabilities within  the legally required age range in the State. This responsibility  includes general supervision of educational programs in all agencies,  including monitoring and evaluating the special education and related  services to insure that they meet State standards, developing a  comprehensive State plan for services for children with disabilities  (including a description of interagency coordination among these  agencies), and providing a Comprehensive System for Personnel  Development related to training needs of all special education and  related service personnel involved in the education of children with  disabilities served by these agencies, including Head Start programs.</p><p class="depth0">Each State has in effect under IDEA a policy assuring all children  with disabilities beginning at least at age three, including those in  public or private institutions or other care facilities, the right to a  free appropriate education and to an evaluation meeting established  procedures. Head Start is either:</p><p class="depth0">The agency through which the Local Education  Agency can meet its obligation to make a free appropriate public  education available through a contract, State or local collaborative  agreement, or other arrangement; or</p><p class="depth0">The agency in which the family chooses to have  the child served rather than using LEA services.</p><p class="depth0">Regardless of how a child is placed in Head Start, the LEA is  responsible for the identification, evaluation and provision of a free  appropriate public education for a child found to be in need of special  education and related services which are mandated in the State. The LEA  is responsible for ensuring that these services are provided, but not  for providing them all. IDEA stresses the role of multiple agencies and  requires their maintenance of effort.</p><p class="depth0">The Head Start responsibility is to make available directly or in  cooperation with other agencies services in the least restrictive  environment in accordance with an individualized education program (IEP)  for at least ten percent of enrolled children who meet the disabilities  eligibility criteria. In addition, Head Start continues to provide or  arrange for the full range of health, dental, nutritional,  developmental, parent involvement and social services provided to all  enrolled children. Head Start has a mandate to recruit and enroll  income-eligible children and children with disabilities who are most in  need of services and to coordinate with the LEA and other groups to  benefit children with disabilities and their families. Serving children  with disabilities has strengthened Head Start's ability to individualize  for all children. Head Start is fully committed to the maintenance of  effort as required for all agencies by the IDEA and by the Head Start   Act (Section 640(a)(2)(A)). Head Start is committed to fiscal support to  assure that the services which children with disabilities need to meet  their special needs will be provided in full, either directly or by a  combination of Head Start funds and other resources.</p><p class="depth0">These Head Start regulations facilitate coordination with the IDEA  by utilizing identical terms for eligibility criteria for the most part.  However, Head Start has elected to use the term ``emotional/behavioral  disorder'' in lieu of ``serious emotional disturbance,'' which is used  in the IDEA, in response to comments and concerns of parents and  professionals. Children who meet State-developed criteria under IDEA  will be eligible for services from Head Start in that State.</p><p class="depth0">In order to organize activities and resources to help children with  disabilities overcome or lessen their disabilities and develop their  potential, it is essential to involve the education, health, social  services, parent involvement, mental health and nutrition components of  Head Start. Parents, staff and policy group members should discuss the  various strategies for ensuring that the disabilities service plan  integrates needs and activities which cut across the Head Start  component areas before the plan is completed.</p><p class="depth0">Advance planning and scheduling of arrangements with other agencies  is a key factor in assuring timely, efficient services. Local level  interagency agreements can greatly facilitate the difficult tasks of  locating related service providers, for example, and joint community  screening programs can reduce delays and costs to each of the  participating agencies.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0">The plan and the annual updates need to be specific, but not  lengthy. As changes occur in the community, the plan needs to reflect  the changes which affect services.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0">Grantees should ensure that the practices they use to provide  special services do not result in undue attention to a child with a  disability. For example, providing names and schedules of special  services for children with disabilities in the classroom is useful for  staff or volunteers coming into that classroom but posting them would  publicize the disability of the individual children.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0">Staff should work for the children's greater independence by  encouraging them to try new things and to meet appropriate goals by  small steps. Grantees should help children with disabilities develop  initiative by including them in opportunities to explore, to create, and  to ask rather than to answer questions. The children need opportunities  to use a wide variety of materials including science tools, art media  and costumes in order to develop skills, imagination and originality.  They should be included on field trips, as their experience may have  been limited, for example, by an orthopedic impairment.</p><p class="depth0">Just as a program makes available pictures and books showing  children and adults from representative cultural, ethnic and  occupational groups, it should provide pictures and books which show  children and adults with disabilities, including those in active roles.</p><p class="depth0">Staff should plan to answer questions children and adults may have  about disabilities. This promotes acceptance of a child with  disabilities for him or herself and leads to treating the child more  normally. Effective curricula are available at low cost for helping  children and adults understand disabilities and for improving attitudes  and increasing knowledge about disabilities. Information on these and  other materials can be obtained from resource access projects  contractors, which offer training and technical assistance to Head Start  programs.</p><p class="depth0">There are a number of useful guides for including children with  disabilities in regular group activities while providing successful  experiences for children who differ widely in developmental levels and  skills. Some of these describe activities around a unit theme with  suggestions for activities suitable for children with different skill  levels. Staff need to help some children with disabilities move into  developmentally appropriate play with other children.</p><p class="depth0">Research has shown the effectiveness of work in small groups for  appropriately selected children with disabilities. This plan allows for  coordinating efforts to meet the needs of individual children as listed  in their IEPs and can help focus resources efficiently.</p><p class="depth0">If a deaf child who uses or needs sign language or another  communication mode is enrolled, a parent, volunteer or aide who can use  that mode of communication should be provided to help the child benefit  from the program.</p><p class="depth0">In order to build the language and speech capabilities of many  children with disabilities who have communication problems, it has been  found helpful to enlist aides, volunteers, cooks, bus drivers and  parents, showing them how to provide extra repetition and model  gradually more advanced language as children improve in their ability to  understand and use language. Small group activities for children with  similar language development needs should be provided regularly as well  as large group language and listening games and individual help. Helping  children with intellectual delays or emotional problems or those whose  experiences have been limited by other disabilities to express their own  ideas and to communicate during play   and throughout the daily activities is motivating and can contribute  greatly to their progress.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (e)</p><p class="depth0">The Disabilities Service Coordinator should possess a basic  understanding of the scope of the Head Start effort and skills adequate  to manage the agency to serve children with disabilities including  coordination with other program components and community agencies and  work with parents.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (f)</p><p class="depth0">For non-verbal children, communication boards, computers and other  assistive technology devices may be helpful. Technical assistance  providers have information on the Technology Related Assistance for  Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988, 29 U.S.C. 2201 et seq. States  are funded through this legislation to plan Statewide assistive  technology services, which should include services for young children.  Parents should be helped to understand the necessity of including  assistive technology services and devices in their child's IEP in order  to obtain them.</p><p class="depth0">The plan should include any renovation of space and facilities which  may be necessary to ensure the safety of the children or promote  learning. For example, rugs or other sound-absorbing surfaces make it  easier for some children to hear stories or conversation. Different  surfaces on floors and play areas affect some children's mobility.</p><p class="depth0">45 CFR Part 84, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Handicap in  Programs and Activities Receiving or Benefiting from Federal Financial  Assistance which implements the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the  Americans with Disabilities Act require that all Federally assisted  programs, including Head Start, be accessible to persons with  disabilities including staff, parents and children. This does not mean  that every building or part of a building must be physically accessible,  but the program services as a whole must be accessible. Structural  changes to make the program services available are required if  alternatives such as reassignment of classes or moving to different  rooms are not possible. Information on the accessibility standards is  available from RAPs or the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights  Division, Coordination and Review Section, P.O. Box 66118, Washington,  DC 20035-6115.</p><p class="depth0">Staff should ensure that children with physical disabilities have  chairs and other pieces of furniture of the correct size and type for  their individual needs as they grow. Agencies such as United Cerebral  Palsy, Easter Seal Societies or SEAs can provide consultation on  adapting or purchasing the appropriate furniture. The correct  positioning of certain children is essential and requires expert advice.  As the children grow, the furniture and equipment should be checked by  an expert, such as a physical therapist, because the wrong fit can be  harmful. Efforts should be made to use furniture sized and shaped to  place children at the same level as their classmates whenever possible.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (h)</p><p class="depth0">The plan should specify:</p><p class="depth0">Overall goals of the disability effort.</p><p class="depth0">Specific objectives and activities of the  disability effort.</p><p class="depth0">How and when specific activities will be carried  out and goals attained.</p><p class="depth0">Who will be responsible for the conduct of each  element of the plan.</p><p class="depth0">How individual activities will be evaluated.</p><p class="depth0">The plan should address:</p><p class="depth0">Enrollment information, including numbers of  children and types of disabilities, known and estimated.</p><p class="depth0">Identification and recruitment of children with  disabilities. Participation in Child Find and list of major specialized  agencies approached.</p><p class="depth0">Screening.</p><p class="depth0">Developmental Assessment.</p><p class="depth0">Evaluation.</p><p class="depth0">The multidisciplinary team and its work.</p><p class="depth0">The process for developing IEPs.</p><p class="depth0">The provision of program services and related  services.</p><p class="depth0">Program accessibility.</p><p class="depth0">Recordkeeping and reporting.</p><p class="depth0">Confidentiality of information.</p><p class="depth0">Any special safety needs.</p><p class="depth0">Medications.</p><p class="depth0">Transportation.</p><p class="depth0">The process for identifying and meeting training  and technical assistance needs.</p><p class="depth0">Special parent involvement needs.</p><p class="depth0">Planned actions to increase the ability of staff  to serve children with more severe disabilities and the number of  children with more severe disabilities served.</p><p class="depth0">Transitioning of children in and out to the next  program.</p><p class="depth0">Particular attention should be given to addressing ways to:</p><p class="depth0">Involve parents throughout the disability effort,  and</p><p class="depth0">Work with other agencies in serving children with  disabilities. It should be possible for a reader to visualize how and by  whom services will be delivered. Coordination with other agencies should  be described, as well as the process for developing local agreements  with other agencies. The RAPs can provide samples and models for the  process of developing agreements with LEAs.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (j)</p><p class="depth0">Children may spend part of the program hours in Head Start for a  mainstreaming experience and part in a specialized program   such as an Easter Seal Society or a local mental health center. The  amount of time spent in either program should be flexible, according to  the needs of the individual child. All services to be provided,  including those provided by collaborating agencies, should be described  in the IEP. Staff of both programs should observe each other's work with  the child who is enrolled and maintain good communication.</p><p class="depth0">Individual services such as occupational, physical or speech  therapy, staff training, transportation, services to families or  counseling may be shared by Head Start and other agencies. For example,  Head Start might provide equipment and transportation while a  development center might provide a facility and physical therapy for a  Head Start child. Some LEAs provide resource teachers while Head Start  provides a developmentally appropriate program in an integrated setting.</p><p class="depth0">Hiring additional staff may be necessary to meet the needs of  children with severe disabilities. Hiring an aide may be necessary on a  full-time, part-time, temporary or as needed basis to assist with the  increased demands of a child with a severe disability. However, aides  should not be assigned the major responsibility for providing direct  services. Aides and volunteers should be guided and supervised by the  disabilities service coordinator or someone with special training. It is  desirable to have the services of a nurse, physical therapist or  licensed practical nurse available for children with severe health or  physical disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Volunteers trained by professionals to work specifically with  children with disabilities can provide valuable individualized support.  For example, a volunteer might be trained by a physical therapist to  carry out specific follow-up activities with individual children.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (k)</p><p class="depth0">State standards for qualifications of staff to provide special  education and related services affect Head Start's acceptance as a  placement site for children who have been evaluated by an LEA. Head  Start grantees, like LEAs, are affected by shortages of staff meeting  State qualifications and are to work toward the goal of meeting the  highest State standards for personnel by developing plans to train  current staff and to hire new staff so that eventually the staff will  meet the qualifications. Grantees should discuss their needs for pre- service and in-service training with SEAs during annual updates of  interagency agreements for use in the planning of joint State level  conferences and for use in preparation of Comprehensive State Personnel  Development plans. They should also discuss these needs with LEAs which  provide in-service training.</p><p class="depth0">The program should provide training for the regular teachers on how  to modify large group, small group or individual activities to meet the  needs of children with disabilities. Specific training for staff should  be provided when Head Start enrolls a child whose disability or  condition requires a special skill or knowledge of special techniques or  equipment. Examples are structuring a language activity, performing  intermittent nonsterile catheterization, changing collection bags,  suctioning, or operating leg braces. Joint training with other agencies  is recommended to stretch resources and exchange expertise.</p><p class="depth0">Staff should have access to regular ongoing training events which  keep them abreast of new materials, equipment and practices related to  serving children with disabilities and to preventing disabilities.  Ongoing training and technical assistance in support of the disabilities  effort should be planned to complement other training available to meet  staff needs. Each grantee has the responsibility to identify or arrange  the necessary support to carry out training for parents and staff.</p><p class="depth0">The best use of training funds has resulted when programs carry out  a staff training needs assessment and relate current year training plans  to previous staff training with the goal of building core capability.  Staff who receive special training should share new knowledge with the  rest of the staff.</p><p class="depth0">The core capability of the program is enhanced when speech, language  and other therapy is provided in the regular site whenever possible.  This allows for the specialist to demonstrate to regular staff and plan  for their follow through. It also reduces costs and time spent  transporting children to clinics and other settings. When university  graduate students are utilized to provide special services as part of  their training, it is helpful to arrange for their supervisors to  monitor their work. Grantees arranging for such assistance are providing  a valuable internship site and it is to the university's advantage to  have their students become familiar with programs on-site. Grantees  should negotiate when developing interagency agreements to have services  provided on-site to the greatest extent possible.</p><p class="depth0">The Head Start Act, Section 648 (42 U.S.C. 9843) (a)(2), calls for  training and technical assistance to be offered to all Head Start  programs with respect to services for children with disabilities without  cost through resource access projects which serve each region of the  country. The technical assistance contractors contact each grantee for a  needs assessment and offer training. While their staffs are small and  their budgets limited, they are experienced and committed to meeting as  many needs as they can and welcome inquiries. A brochure with names and   addresses of the technical assistance providers is available from ACYF/ HS, P.O. Box 1182, Washington, DC 20013.</p><p class="depth0">The SEA is responsible for developing a Comprehensive System of  Personnel Development. It is important that Head Start training needs be  conveyed to this group for planning purposes so that all available  resources can be brought to bear for staff training in Head Start.  Grantees should take advantage of free or low-cost training provided by  SEAs, LEAs, community colleges and other agencies to augment staff  training.</p><p class="depth0">Many agencies offer free training for staff and parents. An example  is the Epilepsy Foundation of America with trained volunteers throughout  the country. The Lighthouse of New York City has developed a training  program on early childhood and vision which was field-tested in Head  Start and is suitable for community agencies. Head Start and the  American Optometric Association have signed a memorandum of  understanding under which member optometrists offer eye health education  and screening. State-funded adult education and training programs or  community colleges make available parenting, child development and other  courses at low or no cost. Grantees should consider the need for  training in working with parents, in developing working collaborative  relationships and in networking when planning training.</p><p class="depth0">The disabilities coordinator needs to work closely with the  education and health coordinators to provide or arrange training for  staff and parents early in each program year on the prevention of  disabilities. This should include the importance of observing signs that  some children may have mild or fluctuating hearing losses due to middle  ear infections. Such losses are often undetected and can cause problems  in learning speech and language. Many children with hearing losses  benefit from amplification and auditory training in how to use their  remaining hearing most efficiently.</p><p class="depth0">The disabilities coordinator should also work with the education  coordinator to provide timely staff training on recognizing signs that  some children may be at high risk for later learning problems as well as  emotional problems resulting from failure and frustration. This training  should address ways to help children develop the skills necessary for  later academic learning, such as following directions calling for more  than one action, sequencing, sustaining attention, and making auditory  and visual discriminations.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (l)</p><p class="depth0">The RAPS can provide information on agreements which have been  developed between Head Start and SEAs and between Head Start and LEAs  and other agencies. Such agreements offer possibilities to share  training, equipment and other resources, smoothing the transition from  Head Start to public or private school for children and their parents.  Some of these agreements specify cost- and resource-sharing practices.  Tribal Government Head Start programs should maximize use of Bureau of  Indian Affairs, LEA and Head Start funds through cooperative agreements.  Indian grantees should contact ACYF for referral to technical assistance  in this regard. Grantees should bear in mind that migrant children are  served in the majority of States and include consideration of their  special needs, including the necessity for rapid provision of special  education and related services, in agreements with LEAs and other  agencies.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (m)</p><p class="depth0">In developing the plan and the budget which is a part of the grant  application process, it is important to budget adequately for the number  of children with disabilities to be served and the types and severity of  their disabilities. The budget should reflect resources available from  other agencies as well as the special costs to be paid for from Head  Start funds. The Head Start legislation requires Head Start to access  resources to meet the needs of all the children enrolled, including  those with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">An effective plan calls for the careful use of funds. The  Disabilities Services Coordinator needs to keep current with the  provisions of Part B of the IDEA and the services which may be available  for three through five year-old children under this Act. Coordinators  also need to utilize the expanded services under the Early and Periodic  Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) program and Supplemental  Security Income program.</p><p class="depth0">To assist in the development of the plan, it may be helpful to  establish an advisory committee for the disability effort or to expand  the scope of the health advisory committee.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (o)</p><p class="depth0">Examples of evaluation costs which can be covered include  professional assessment by the multidisciplinary evaluation team,  instruments, professional observation and professional consultation. If  consultation fees for multidisciplinary evaluation team members to  participate in IEP meetings are not available from another source, they  are allowable expenditures and need to be provided to meet the  performance standards.</p><p class="depth0">Many children with disabilities enrolled in Head Start already  receive services from other agencies, and grantees should encourage  these agencies to continue to provide services. Grantees should use  other community agencies and resources to supplement services for  children with disabilities and their families.</p><p class="depth0">By planning ahead, grantees can pool resources to schedule the  periodic use of experts and consultants. Grantees can time-share,  reducing travel charges and assuring the availability of scarce  expertise. Some LEAs and other agencies have enabling legislation and  funds to contract for education, health, and developmental services of  the type Head Start can provide. Grantees can also help increase the  amount of preschool funding available to their State under the  Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. The amount of the  allocation to each SEA and to the public schools is affected by the  number of three through five year old children with IEPs in place by  December 1 of each year. By establishing good working relationships with  State Public Health personnel and including them on advisory committees,  health resources can be more easily utilized.</p><p class="depth0">It may be helpful to explore the possibility of a cooperative  agreement with the public school system to provide transportation. If  the lack of transportation would prevent a child with disabilities from  participating in Head Start, program funds are to be used to provide  this related service before a delay occurs which would have a negative  effect on the child's progress. The major emphasis is on providing the  needed special help so that the child can develop to the maximum during  the brief time in Head Start.</p><p class="depth0">The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101)  requires that new buses (ordered after August 26, 1990) by public bus  systems must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. New over- the-road buses ordered by privately operated bus and van companies (on  or after July 26, 1996 or July 26, 1997 for small companies) must be  accessible. Other new vehicles, such as vans, must be accessible, unless  the transportation company provides service to individuals with  disabilities that is equivalent to that operated for the general public.  The Justice Department enforces these requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Efforts should be made to obtain expensive items such as wheelchairs  or audiometers through resources such as Title V (formerly Crippled  Children's Services). Cooperative arrangements can be made with LEAs and  other agencies to share equipment such as tympanometers. Special  equipment such as hearing aids may be obtained through EPSDT or from SSI  funds for those children who have been found eligible. Some States have  established libraries of assistive technology devices and rosters of  expert consultants.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1308.5 Recruitment and Enrollment of Children With Disabilities</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0">Head Start can play an important role in Child Find by helping to  locate children in need and hardest to reach, such as immigrants and  non-English speakers. In cooperation with other community groups and  agencies serving children with disabilities, Head Start programs should  incorporate in their outreach and recruitment procedures efforts to  identify and enroll children with disabilities who meet eligibility  requirements and whose parents desire the child's participation.</p><p class="depth0">Integrating children with severe disabilities for whom Head Start is  an appropriate placement is a goal of ACYF. Grantees should bear in mind  that 45 CFR part 84, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Handicap in  Programs and Activities Receiving or Benefiting from Federal Financial  Assistance or the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (20 U.S.C. 794) states that  any program receiving Federal funds may not deny admission to a child  solely on the basis of the nature or extent of a disabling condition and  shall take into account the needs of the child in determining the aid,  benefits, or services to be provided. Many children who appear to have  serious impairments are nevertheless able to make greater gains in an  integrated setting than in a segregated classroom for children with  disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">The key factor in selecting an appropriate placement is the IEP. The  need of the individual child and the ability of the child to benefit are  determining factors. Likewise, the amount of time per day or week to be  spent in the regular setting and/or in other settings is determined by  the IEP. The IEP of a child with a severe emotional/behavioral disorder,  for example, might realistically call for less than full day attendance  or for dual placement. Another factor to consider is that according to  the PIR, the majority of children with severe impairments are provided  special services by both Head State staff and staff of other agencies,  sharing the responsibility. Many grantees have successfully served  children with moderate and severe disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">The disabilities coordinator's responsibility includes providing  current names of appropriate specialized agencies serving young children  with disabilities and the names of LEA Child Find contact persons to the  director to facilitate joint identification of children with  disabilities. It also includes learning what resources other agencies  have available and the eligibility criteria for support from State  agencies, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Title V, Maternal and  Child Health Block Grants, Title XIX (EPSDT/Medicaid), Migrant Health  Centers, Developmental Disabilities programs, Bureau of Indian Affairs,  third party payers such as insurance companies and other sources.</p><p class="depth0">Grantees need to develop lists of appropriate referral sources.  These include hospital child life programs, SSI, early intervention  programs funded by Part H of the IDEA or other sources, EPSDT providers,  infant stimulation programs, Easter Seal and United Cerebral Palsy  agencies, mental health agencies, Association for Retarded Citizens  chapters, Developmental Disabilities Planning Councils, Protection and  Advocacy Systems, University Affiliated Programs, the LEA Child Find,  and the medical community.</p><p class="depth0">Head Start programs are encouraged to increase the visibility of the  Head Start mainstreaming effort within the community by:</p><p class="depth0">Including community child service providers on  policy council health and disability advisory boards and in other  relevant Head Start activities.</p><p class="depth0">Making presentations on Head Start mainstreaming  experiences at local, State and Regional meetings and conferences, such  as the National Association for the Education of Young Children, Council  for Exceptional Children, and the Association for the Care of Children's  Health.</p><p class="depth0">Participating in interagency planning activities  for preschool infant and toddler programs such as the State Interagency  Coordinating Councils supported under the IDEA.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0">Grantees should maintain records of outreach, recruitment, and  service activities for children with disabilities and their families.</p><p class="depth0">Each grantee should develop a policy on what types of information  are to be included in a comprehensive file for each disabled child. The  policy should outline the locations where a copy of each record will be  sent. For example, while a comprehensive file will be maintained at the  Head Start program central office (where the disability services  coordinator and component coordinators may be based), a teacher must  have access to a child's IEP and progress notes in order to plan  effectively. Confidentiality needs to be maintained in a manner which  allows for access to information by appropriate staff while meeting  applicable Head Start and State requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0">Staff should assist families who need help in obtaining  immunizations before the program year begins, bearing in mind that a  goal of parent involvement and social service activities is to encourage  independence and develop skills in meeting timelines when seeking  services for children. Care should be taken that children are not denied  enrollment, but that their families receive the necessary assistance to  meet entrance requirements. ``Healthy Young Children: A Manual for  Programs,'' (a cooperative effort of the Administration for Children,  Youth and Families, the American Academy of Pediatrics; the Division of  Maternal and Child Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services;  Georgetown University Child Development Center; Massachusetts Department  of Public Health, and the National Association for the Education of  Young Children, 1988, copyright, NAEYC) contains best practice guidance.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1308.6 Assessment of Children</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0">Early screening is essential because of the time required for the  steps necessary before special services can begin. It has been very  difficult for some grantees to complete health screenings in a timely  manner for several reasons including the lack of resources, especially  in rural areas; the need to rely on donated services from agencies whose  schedules have been especially overloaded during September and October  after the start of the Head Start program year; lack of summer staff in  most programs; and the difficulty in reaching some families. Lack of  coordination among agencies with legislative responsibility for  identifying children with disabilities has resulted in duplication and  unacceptable delays in providing required services for many grantees.  Other grantees, however, have demonstrated the ability to complete  screenings early in the program year without difficulty. Many programs  already complete screening by 45 days after the first day of program  operation. Some participate in spring or summer screening programs in  their areas before the fall opening. Grantees are encouraged to schedule  well in advance with clinics and with such providers as EPSDT and the  Indian Health Service for timely screening and any subsequent  evaluations that may be needed.</p><p class="depth0">Recently, a number of legislative and legal requirements have  increased the resources available for the screening and evaluation of  children. Title XIX, EPDST/Medicaid, has new requirements for screening  and evaluation, as well as treatment; the Social Security Administration  has modified eligibility requirements for children with disabilities so  that more services will be available; and all States have assured that  services will be provided from at least age three under IDEA so that  LEAs in more States will be engaged in identifying and evaluating  children from birth to age six.</p><p class="depth0">In response to these changes, the Department of Health and Human  Services and the Department of Education, through the Federal  Interagency Coordinating Council, have developed a cooperative agreement  for coordinated screening. Head Start is one of the   participating agencies which will work together to plan and implement  community screenings, assisting the LEAs which have the major  responsibility for identifying every child with a disability under the  IDEA. In addition, programs may elect to make some summer staff  available for activities to close out program work in the spring and  prepare for the fall.</p><p class="depth0">These developments make timely screening feasible. They also make it  possible to expedite immunizations. State-of-the-art coordinated  screening programs make immunizations available.</p><p class="depth0">This coordination can focus staff energy on assisting families to  have their children immunized during the screening phase rather than  making repeated follow-up efforts after the program for children has  begun. Coordinated screening also provides an excellent parent education  opportunity. Information on child development, realistic expectations  for preschoolers and such services as WIC can be provided during the  screening. Some communities have combined screening with well-received  health fairs.</p><p class="depth0">The staff should be involved in the planning of screening to assure  that screening requirements are selected or adapted with the specific  Head Start population and goals of the screening process in mind.  Instruments with age-appropriate norms should be used. Children should  be screened in their native language. Universities, civic organizations  or organizations to aid recent immigrants may be able to locate native  speakers to assist. The RAPs can provide information on the  characteristics of screening instruments.</p><p class="depth0">Current best practice indicates that individual pure tone audiometry  be used as the first part of a screening program with children as young  as three. The purpose is to identify children with hearing impairments  that interfere with, or have the potential to interfere with  communication. The recommended procedure is audiometric screening at 20  dB HL (re ANSI-1969) at the frequencies of 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz, (and  at 500 Hz unless acoustic immittance audiometry is included as the  second part of the screening program and if the noise level in the room  permits testing at that frequency.) Acoustic immittance audiometry (or  impedance audiometry) is recommended as the second part of the program  to identify children who have middle-ear disorders.</p><p class="depth0">The audiometric screening program should be conducted or supervised  by an audiologist. Nonprofessional support staff have successfully  carried out audiometric screening with appropriate training and  supervision.</p><p class="depth0">When a child fails the initial screening, an audiometric rescreening  should be administered the same day or no later than within 2 weeks. A  child who fails the rescreening should be referred for an evaluation by  an audiologist.</p><p class="depth0">Current best practice calls for annual hearing tests. Frequent  rescreening is needed for children with recurrent ear infections.  Grantees who contract or arrange for hearing testing should check to  assure that the testing covers the three specified frequencies and that  other quality features are present. Speech, hearing and language  problems are the most widespread disabilities in preschool programs and  quality testing is vital for early detection and remediation.</p><p class="depth0">Playing listening games prior to testing and getting use to  earphones can help children learn to respond to a tone and improve the  quality of the testing.</p><p class="depth0">Some grantees have found it strengthens the skills of their staff to  have all members learn to do developmental screening. This can be a  valuable in-service activity especially for teachers. State requirements  for qualifications should be checked and non-professional screeners  should be trained.</p><p class="depth0">Some programs have involved trained students from schools of  nursing, child development or special education graduate students, or  medical students who must carry out screening work as part of their  required experience.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0">Parents should be provided assistance if necessary, so that they can  participate in the developmental assessment.</p><p class="depth0">Grantees should offer parents assistance in understanding the  implications of developmental assessments as well as medical, dental or  other conditions which can affect their child's development and  learning.</p><p class="depth0">Development assessment is an ongoing process and information from  observations in the Head Start center and at home should be recorded  periodically and updated in each developmental area in order to document  progress and plan activities.</p><p class="depth0">Disabilities coordinators, as well as education staff, need to be  thoroughly familiar with developmental assessment activities such as  objective observation, time sampling and obtaining parent information  and the use of formal assessment instruments. Knowledge of normal child  development and understanding of the culture of the child are also  important.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (e)</p><p class="depth0">While the LEA is responsible for assuring that each child who is  referred is evaluated in accordance with the provisions of IDEA and  usually provides the evaluation, grantees may sometimes provide for the  evaluation. In that event, grantees need to assure that evaluation  specialists in appropriate areas such as psychology, special education,  speech pathology and physical therapy coordinate their activities so  that the child's total functioning is considered and the   team's findings and recommendations are integrated.</p><p class="depth0">Grantees should select members of the multidisciplinary evaluation  team who are familiar with the specific Head Start population, taking  into account the age of the children and their cultural and ethnic  background as they relate to the overall diagnostic process and the use  of specific tests.</p><p class="depth0">Grantees should be certain that team members understand that Head  Start programs are funded to provide preschool developmental experiences  for all eligible children, some of whom also need special education and  related services. The intent of the evaluation procedures is to provide  information to identify children who have disabling conditions so they  can receive appropriate assistance. It is also the intent to avoid  mislabeling children for whom basic Head Start programming is designed  and who may show developmental delays which can be overcome by a regular  comprehensive program meeting the Head Start Performance Standards.</p><p class="depth0">When a grantee provides for the evaluation of a child, it is  important that the Head Start eligibility criteria be explained to the  evaluation team members and that they be informed as to how the results  will be used.</p><p class="depth0">Grantees should require specific findings in writing from the  evaluation team, and recommendations for intervention when the team  believes the child has a disability. The findings will be used in  developing the child's IEP to ensure that parents, teachers and others  can best work with the child. Some grantees have obtained useful  functional information by asking team members to complete a brief form  describing the child's strengths and weaknesses and the effects of the  disability along with suggestions for special equipment, treatment or  services. The evaluators should be asked in advance to provide their  findings promptly in easily understood terms. They should provide  separate findings and, when they agree, consensus professional opinions.  When planning in advance for evaluation services from other agencies,  grantees should try to obtain agreements on prompt timing for delivery  of reports which are necessary to plan services.</p><p class="depth0">To assist the evaluation team, Head Start should provide the child's  screening results, pertinent observations, and the results of any  developmental assessment information which may be available.</p><p class="depth0">It is important that programs ensure that no individual child or  family is labeled, mislabeled, or stigmatized with reference to a  disabling condition. Head Start must exercise care to ensure that no  child is misidentified because of economic circumstances, ethnic or  cultural factors or developmental lags not caused by a disability,  bilingual or dialectical differences, or because of being non-English  speaking.</p><p class="depth0">If Head Start is arranging for the evaluation, it is important to  understand that a child whose problem has been corrected (e.g., a child  wearing glasses whose vision is corrected and who does not need special  education and related services) does not qualify as a child with a  disability. A short-term medical problem such as post-operative recovery  or a problem requiring only medical care and health monitoring when the  evaluation specialists have not stated that special education and  related services are needed does not qualify as a disability.</p><p class="depth0">The evaluation team should include consideration of the way the  disability affects the child's ability to function as well as the cause  of the condition.</p><p class="depth0">Some children may have a recent evaluation from a clinic, hospital  or other agency (other than the LEAs) prior to enrolling in Head Start.  If that evaluation did not include needed functional information or a  professional opinion as to whether the child meets one of the Head Start  eligibility criteria, the grantee should contact the agency to try to  obtain that information.</p><p class="depth0">Some children, prior to enrolling in Head Start, already have been  diagnosed as having severe disabilities and a serious need for services.  Some of these children already may be receiving some special assistance  from other agencies for their disabilities but lack developmental  services in a setting with other children. Head Start programs may best  meet their needs by serving them jointly, i.e., providing developmental  services while disability services are provided from another source. It  is important in such situations that regular communication take place  between the two sites.</p><p class="depth0">Beginning in 1990, State EPSDT/Medicaid programs must, by law,  evaluate and provide services for young children whose families meet  eligibility criteria at 133 percent of the poverty levels. This is a  resource for Head Start and it is important to become aware of EPSDT  provisions.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1308.7 Eligibility Criteria: Health Impairment Guidance</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0">Many health impairments manifest themselves in other disabling  conditions. Because of this, particular care should be taken when  classifying a health impaired child.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0">Because AIDS is a health impairment, grantees will continue to  enroll children with AIDS on an individual basis. Staff need to be  familiar with the Head Start Information Memorandum on Enrollment in  Head Start Programs of Infants and Young Children with Human  Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), AIDS Related Complex (ARC), or Acquired  Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)   dated June 22, 1988. This guidance includes material from the Centers  for Disease Control which stresses the need for a team, including a  physician, to make informed decisions on enrollment on an individual  basis. It provides guidance in the event that a child with disabilities  presents a problem involving biting or bodily fluids. The guidance also  discusses methods for control of all infectious diseases through  stringent cleanliness standards and includes lists of Federal, State and  national agencies and organizations that can provide additional  information as more is learned. Staff should be aware that there is a  high incidence of visual impairment among children with HIV and AIDS.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0">Teachers or others in the program setting are in the best position  to note the following kinds of indications that a child may need to be  evaluated to determine whether an attention deficit disorder exists:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inability of a child who is trying to participate in classroom  activities to be able to orient attention, for example to choose an  activity for free time or to attend to simple instructions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inability to maintain attention, as in trying to complete a  selected activity, to carry out simple requests or attend to telling of  an interesting story; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Inability to focus attention on recent activities, for example  on telling the teacher about a selected activity, inability to tell  about simple requests after carrying them out, or inability to tell  about a story after hearing it.</p><p class="depth0">These indicators should only be used after the children have had  sufficient time to become familiar with preschool procedures and after  most of the children are able easily to carry out typical preschool  activities.</p><p class="depth0">Culturally competent staff recognize and appreciate cultural  differences, and this awareness needs to include understanding that some  cultural groups may promote behavior that may be misinterpreted as  inattention. Care must be taken that any deviations in attention  behavior which are within the cultural norms of the child's group are  not used as indicators of possible attention deficit disorder.</p><p class="depth0">A period of careful observation over three months can assure that  adequate documentation is available for the difficult task of  evaluation. It also provides opportunity to provide extra assistance to  the child, perhaps through an aide or special education student under  the teacher's direction, which might improve the child's functioning and  eliminate the behavior taken as evidence of possible attention deficit  disorder.</p><p class="depth0">Attention deficit disorders are not the result of learning  disabilities, emotional/behavioral disabilities, autism or mental  retardation. A comprehensive psychological evaluation may be carried out  in some cases to rule out learning disability or mental retardation. It  is possible, however, in some instances for this disability to coexist  with another disability. Children who meet the criteria for multiple  disabilities (e.g., attention deficient disorder and learning  disability, or emotional/behavioral disorder, or mental retardation)  would be eligible for services as children with multiple disabilities or  under their primary disability.</p><p class="depth0">Teacher and parent reports have been found to provide the most  useful information for assessment of children suspected of having  attention deficit disorder. They are also useful in planning and  providing special education intervention. The most successful approach  may be a positive behavior modification program in the classroom,  combined with a carryover program in the home. Prompt and clear response  should be provided consistently. Positive reinforcement for appropriate  behavior, based on rewards such as stickers or small items desired by  the child has been found effective for children with this disorder,  along with occasional withholding of rewards or postponing of desired  activities in the face of inappropriate behavior. Effective programs  suggest that positive interactions with the child after appropriate  behavior are needed at least three times as often as any negative  response interactions after inappropriate behavior. Consultants familiar  with behavior modification should be used to assist teachers in planning  and carrying out intervention which can maintain this positive to  negative ratio while shaping behaviors. These behavior interventions can  be provided in mainstream placements with sufficient personnel.</p><p class="depth0">Suggested Primary Members of A Head Start Evaluation Team for Health  Impaired Children:</p><p class="depth0">Physician.</p><p class="depth0">Pediatrician.</p><p class="depth0">Psychologist.</p><p class="depth0">Other specialists related to specific disabilities.</p><p class="depth0">Possible Related Services:</p><p class="depth0">(Related services are determined by individual need.

In  addition, a daily check when an audiometer is in use and a check of the  acoustics in the testing site are needed for accurate testing.</p><p class="depth0">Approximately 17 percent of Down Syndrome children have a condition  of the spine (atlanto-axial instability) and should not engage in  somersaults, trampoline exercises, or other activities which could lead  to spinal injury without first having a cervical spine x-ray.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0">The disabilities services coordinator needs to assure that best use  is made of mental health consultants when a child appears to have a  problem which may be symptomatic of a disability in the social/emotional  area. Teachers, aides and volunteers should keep anecdotal records of  the child's activities, tantrums, the events which appear to precipitate  the tantrums, language use, etc. These can provide valuable information  to a mental health consultant, who should be used primarily to make  specific recommendations and assist the staff rather than to document  the problem.</p><p class="depth0">The mental health coordinator can cooperate in setting up group  meetings for parents of children with disabilities which provide needed  support and a forum for talking over mutual concerns. Parents needing  community mental health services may need direct assistance in accessing  services, especially at first.</p><p class="depth0">The disability services coordinator needs to work closely with staff  across components to help parents of children who do not have  disabilities become more understanding and knowledgeable about  disabilities and ways to lessen their effects. This can help reduce the  isolation which some families with children with disabilities  experience.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraphs (c) and (d)</p><p class="depth0">Arrangements should be made with the family and the physician to  schedule the administration of medication during times when the child is  most likely to be under parental supervision.</p><p class="depth0">Awareness of possible side effects is of particular importance when  treatment for a disability requires administration of potentially  harmful drugs (e.g., anti-convulsants, amphetamines).</p><p class="depth0">Section 1308.19 Developing Individual Education Programs (IEPs)</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0">The IEP determines the type of placement and the specific  programming which are appropriate for a child. The least restrictive  environment must be provided and staff need to understand that this  means the most appropriate placement in a regular program to the maximum  extent possible based on the IEP. Because it is individually determined,  the least restrictive environment varies for different children.  Likewise, the least restrictive environment for a given child can vary  over time as the disability is remediated or worsens. A mainstreamed  placement, in a regular program with services delivered by regular or  special staff, is one type of integrated placement on the continuum of  possible options. It represents the least restrictive environment for  many children.</p><p class="depth0">Following screening, evaluation and the determination that a child  meets the eligibility criteria and has a disability, a plan to meet the  child's individual needs for special education and related services is  developed. In order to facilitate communication with other agencies  which may cooperate in providing services and especially with LEAs or  private schools which the children will eventually enter, it is  recommended that programs become familiar with the format of the IEP  used by the LEAs and use that format to foster coordination. However,  the format of the IEP to be developed for children in Head Start can  vary according to local option. It should be developed to serve as a  working document for teachers and others providing services for a child.</p><p class="depth0">It is recommended that the staff review the IEP of each child with a  disability more frequently than the minimum once a year to keep the  objectives and activities current.</p><p class="depth0">It is ideal if a child can be mainstreamed in the full program with  modifications of some of the small group, large group or individual  program activities to meet his or her special needs and this should be  the first option considered. However, this is not possible or realistic  in some cases on a full-time basis. The IEP team needs to consider the  findings and recommendations of the multi-disciplinary evaluation team,  observation and developmental assessment information from the Head Start  staff and parents, parental information and desires, and the IEP to plan  for the best situation for each child. Periodic reviews can change the  degree to which a child can be mainstreamed during the program year. For  example, a child with autism whose IEP called for part-time services in  Head Start in the fall might improve so that by spring the hours could  be extended.</p><p class="depth0">If Head Start is not an appropriate placement to meet the child's  needs according to the IEP, referral should be made to another agency.</p><p class="depth0">Helpful specific information based on experience in Head Start is  provided in manuals and resource materials on serving children with  disabilities developed by ACYF and by technical assistance providers.  They cover such aspects of developing and implementing the IEP as:</p><p class="depth0">Gathering data needed to develop the IEP;</p><p class="depth0">Preparing parents for the IEP conference;</p><p class="depth0">Writing IEPs useful to teachers; and</p><p class="depth0">Developing appropriate curriculum activities and  home follow-up activities.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (j)</p><p class="depth0">Programs are encouraged to offer parents assistance in noting how  their child functions at home and in the neighborhood. Parents should be  encouraged to contribute this valuable information to the staff for use  in ongoing planning. Care should be taken to put parents at ease and to  eliminate or explain specialized terminology. Comfortable settings,  familiar meeting rooms and ample preparation can help lessen anxiety.  The main purpose is to involve parents actively, not just to obtain  their signature on the IEP.</p><p class="depth0">It is important to involve the parents of children with disabilities  in activities related to their child's unique needs, including the  procurement and coordination of specialized services and follow-through  on the child's treatment plan, to the extent possible. It is especially  helpful for Head Start to assist parents in developing confidence,  strategies and techniques to become effective advocates for their  children and to negotiate complicated systems. Under IDEA, a federally- funded Parent Training and Information Program exists whereby parent  training centers in each State provide information, support and  assistance to parents enabling them to advocate for their child.  Information regarding these centers should be given to parents of a  child determined to have a disability. Because some parents will need to  advocate for their children over a number of years, they need to gain  the confidence and skills to access resources and negotiate systems with  increasing independence.</p><p class="depth0">Some parents of children with disabilities are also disabled. Staff  may need to adjust procedures for assisting parents who have  disabilities to participate in their children's programs. Materials to  assist in this effort are available from technical assistance providers.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1308.20 Nutrition Services</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0">Vocabulary and concept building, counting, learning place settings,  social skills   such as conversation and acceptable manners can be naturally developed  at meal or snack time, thus enhancing children's skills. Children with  disabilities often need planned attention to these areas.</p><p class="depth0">The staff person who is responsible for nutrition and the  disabilities services coordinator should work with the social services  coordinator to help families access nutrition resources and services for  children who are not able to learn or develop normally because of  malnutrition.</p><p class="depth0">The staff person who is responsible for nutrition and the  disabilities services coordinator should alert staff to watch for  practices leading to baby bottle caries. This is severe tooth decay  caused by putting a baby or toddler to bed with a nursing bottle  containing milk, juice or sugar water or letting the child carry around  a bottle for long periods of time. The serious dental and speech  problems this can cause are completely preventable.</p><p class="depth0">In cases of severe allergies, staff should work closely with the  child's physician or a medical consultant.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1308.21 Parent Participation and Transition of Children From</p><p class="depth0">Head Start to Public School</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0">Grantees should help parents understand the value of special early  assistance for a child with a disability and reassure those parents who  may fear that if their child receives special education services the  child may always need them. This is not the experience in Head Start and  most other preschool programs where the majority of children no longer  receive special education after the preschool years. The disabilities  coordinator needs to help parents understand that their active  participation is of great importance in helping their children overcome  or lessen the effects of disabilities and develop to their full  potential.</p><p class="depth0">The disabilities coordinator should help program staff deal  realistically with parents of children who have unfamiliar disabilities  by providing the needed information, training and contact with  consultants or specialized agencies. The coordinator should ensure that  staff carrying out family needs assessment or home visits do not  overlook possible disabilities among younger siblings who should be  referred for early evaluation and preventive actions.</p><p class="depth0">Guidance for Paragraphs (b) and (c)</p><p class="depth0">As most Head Start children will move into the public school system,  disabilities coordinators need to work with the Head Start staff for  early and ongoing activities designed to minimize discontinuity and  stress for children and families as they move into a different system.  As the ongoing advocates, parents will need to be informed and confident  in communicating with school personnel and staff of social service and  medical agencies. Disabilities coordinators need to ensure that the Head  Start program:</p><p class="depth0">Provides information on services available for  LEAs and other sources of services parents will have to access on their  own, such as dental treatment;</p><p class="depth0">Informs parents of the differences between the  two systems in role, staffing patterns, schedules, and focus;</p><p class="depth0">Provides opportunities for mutual visits by staff  to one another's facilities to help plan appropriate placement;</p><p class="depth0">Familiarizes parents and staff of the receiving  program's characteristics and expections;</p><p class="depth0">Provides early and mutually planned transfer of  records with parent consent at times convenient for both systems;</p><p class="depth0">Provides information on services available under  the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, the federally-funded  parent training centers and provisions for parent involvement and due  process; and</p><p class="depth0">Provides opportunities for parents to confer with  staff to express their ideas and needs so they have experience in  participating in IEP and other conferences in an active, confident  manner. Role playing has been found helpful.</p><p class="depth0">It is strongly recommended that programs develop activities for  smooth transition into Head Start from Part H infant/toddler programs  funded under IDEA and from Head Start to kindergarten or other  placement. In order to be effective, such plans must be developed  jointly. They are advantageous for the children, parents, Part H  programs, Head Start and LEAs. ACYF has developed materials useful for  transition. American Indian programs whose children move into several  systems, such as Bureau of Indian Affairs schools and public schools,  need to prepare children and families in advance for the new situation.  Plans should be used as working documents and reviewed for annual  update, so that the foundation laid in Head Start is maintained and  strengthened.</p>
