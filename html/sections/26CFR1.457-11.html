                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Under section 457(f), if an eligible employer  provides for a deferral of compensation under any agreement or  arrangement that is an ineligible plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compensation deferred under the agreement or arrangement is  includible in the gross income of the participant or beneficiary for the  first taxable year in which there is no substantial risk of forfeiture  (within the meaning of section 457(f)(3)(B)) of the rights to such  compensation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the compensation deferred is subject to a substantial risk of  forfeiture, the amount includible in gross income for the first taxable  year in which there is no substantial risk of forfeiture includes  earnings thereon to the date on which there is no substantial risk of  forfeiture;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Earnings credited on the compensation deferred under the  agreement or arrangement that are not includible in gross income under  paragraph (a)(2) of this section are includible in the gross income of  the participant or beneficiary only when paid or made available to the  participant or beneficiary, provided that the interest of the  participant or beneficiary in any assets (including amounts deferred  under the plan) of the entity sponsoring the agreement or arrangement is  not senior to the entity's general creditors; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amounts paid or made available to a participant or beneficiary  under the agreement or arrangement are includible in the gross income of  the participant or beneficiary under section 72, relating to annuities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply with  respect to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A plan described in section 401(a) which includes a trust exempt  from tax under section 501(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An annuity plan or contract described in section 403;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> That portion of any plan which consists of a transfer of  property described in section 83;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> That portion of any plan which consists of a trust to which  section 402(b) applies; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement described in  section 415(m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Amount included in income. The amount included in gross income  on the applicable date under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this  section is equal to the present value of the compensation (including  earnings to the extent provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) on  that date. For purposes of applying section 72 on the applicable date  under paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, the participant is  treated as having paid investment in the contract (or basis) to the  extent that the deferred compensation has been taken into account by the  participant in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Coordination of section 457(f) with section 83--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General  rules. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, section 457(f) and  paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to that portion of any plan  which consists of a transfer of property described in section 83. For  this purpose, a transfer of property described in section 83 means a  transfer of property to which section 83 applies. Section 457(f) and  paragraph (a) of this section do not apply if the date on which there is  no substantial risk of forfeiture with respect to compensation deferred  under an agreement or arrangement that is not an eligible plan is on or  after the date on which there is a transfer of property to which section  83 applies. However, section 457(f) and paragraph (a) of this section  apply if the date on which there is no substantial risk of forfeiture  with respect to compensation deferred under an agreement or arrangement  that is not an eligible plan precedes the date on which there is a  transfer of property to which section 83 applies. If deferred  compensation payable in property is   includible in gross income under section 457(f), then, as provided in  section 72, the amount includible in gross income when that property is  later transferred or made available to the service provider is the  excess of the value of the property at that time over the amount  previously included in gross income under section 457(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (d) are illustrated  in the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. As part of an arrangement for the deferral of  compensation, an eligible employer agrees on December 1, 2002 to pay an  individual rendering services for the eligible employer a specified  dollar amount on January 15, 2005. The arrangement provides for the  payment to be made in the form of property having a fair market value  equal to the specified dollar amount. The individual's rights to the  payment are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the  meaning of section 457(f)(3)(B)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, because there is no substantial  risk of forfeiture with respect to the agreement to transfer property in  2005, the present value (as of December 1, 2002) of the payment is  includible in the individual's gross income for 2002. Under paragraph  (a)(4) of this section, when the payment is made on January 15, 2005,  the amount includible in the individual's gross income is equal to the  excess of the fair market value of the property when paid, over the  amount that was includible in gross income for 2002 (which is the basis  allocable to that payment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. As part of an arrangement for the deferral of  compensation, individuals A and B rendering services for a tax-exempt  entity each receive in 2010 property that is subject to a substantial  risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of section 457(f)(3)(B) and  within the meaning of section 83(c)(1)). Individual A makes an election  to include the fair market value of the property in gross income under  section 83(b) and individual B does not make this election. The  substantial risk of forfeiture for the property transferred to  individual A lapses in 2012 and the substantial risk of forfeiture for  the property transferred to individual B also lapses in 2012. Thus, the  property transferred to individual A is included in A's gross income for  2010 when A makes a section 83(b) election and the property transferred  to individual B is included in B's gross income for 2012 when the  substantial risk of forfeiture for the property lapses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, in each case, the compensation  deferred is not subject to section 457(f) or this section because  section 83 applies to the transfer of property on or before the date on  which there is no substantial risk of forfeiture with respect to  compensation deferred under the arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In 2004, Z, a tax-exempt entity, grants an  option to acquire property to employee C. The option lacks a readily  ascertainable fair market value, within the meaning of section 83(e)(3),  has a value on the date of grant equal to $100,000, and is not subject  to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of section  457(f)(3)(B) and within the meaning of section 83(c)(1)). Z exercises  the option in 2012 by paying an exercise price of $75,000 and receives  property that has a fair market value (for purposes of section 83) equal  to $300,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, under section 83(e)(3), section  83 does not apply to the grant of the option. Accordingly, C has income  of $100,000 in 2004 under section 457(f). In 2012, C has income of  $125,000, which is the value of the property transferred in 2012, minus  the allocable portion of the basis that results from the $100,000 of  income in 2004 and the $75,000 exercise price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. In 2010, X, a tax-exempt entity, agrees to pay  deferred compensation to employee D. The amount payable is $100,000 to  be paid 10 years later in 2020. The commitment to make the $100,000  payment is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. In 2010, the  present value of the $100,000 is $50,000. In 2018, X transfers to D  property having a fair market value (for purposes of section 83) equal  to $70,000. The transfer is in partial settlement of the commitment made  in 2010 and, at the time of the transfer in 2018, the present value of  the commitment is $80,000. In 2020, X pays D the $12,500 that remains  due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, D has income of $50,000 in 2010.  In 2018, D has income of $30,000, which is the amount transferred in  2018, minus the allocable portion of the basis that results from the  $50,000 of income in 2010. (Under section 72(e)(2)(B), income is  allocated first. The income is equal to $30,000 ($80,000 minus the  $50,000 basis), with the result that the allocable portion of the basis  is equal to $40,000 ($70,000 minus the $30,000 of income).) In 2020, D  has income of $2,500 ($12,500 minus $10,000, which is the excess of the  original $50,000 basis over the $40,000 basis allocated to the transfer  made in 2018).
