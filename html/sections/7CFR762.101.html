                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This subpart contains regulations governing Operating  loans, Farm Ownership loans, and Conservation loans guaranteed by the  Agency. This subpart applies to lenders, holders, borrowers, Agency  personnel, and   other parties involved in making, guaranteeing, holding, servicing, or  liquidating such loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lender list. The Agency maintains a current list of lenders who  express a desire to participate in the guaranteed loan program. This  list is made available to farmers upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Lender classification. Lenders who participate in the Agency  guaranteed loan program will be classified into one of the following  categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Standard Eligible Lender under Sec. 762.105;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certified Lender, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Preferred Lender under Sec. 762.106.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Type of guarantee. Guarantees are available for both a loan note  or a line of credit. A loan note is used for a loan of fixed amount and  term. A line of credit has a fixed term, but no fixed amount. The  principal amount outstanding at any time, however, may not exceed the  line of credit ceiling contained in the contract. Both guarantees are  evidenced by the same loan guarantee form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Termination of loan guarantee. The loan guarantee will  automatically terminate as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon full payment of the guaranteed loan. A zero balance within  the period authorized for advances on a line of credit will not  terminate the guarantee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon payment of a final loss claim; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon written notice from the lender to the Agency that a  guarantee is no longer desired provided the lender holds all of the  guaranteed portion of the loan. The loan guarantee will be returned to  the Agency office for cancellation within 30 days of the date of the  notice by the lender.
