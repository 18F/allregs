                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application deadline. CMS accepts qualified entity applications  on a rolling basis after an application is made available on the CMS Web  site. CMS reviews applications in the order in which they are received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Selection criteria. To be approved as a qualified entity under  this subpart, the applicant must meet one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Standard approval process: Meet the eligibility and operational  and governance requirements, fulfill all of the application requirements  to CMS' satisfaction, and agree to pay a fee equal to the cost of CMS  making the data available. The applicant and each of its contractors  that are anticipated to have access to the Medicare data must also  execute a Data Use Agreement with CMS, that among other things,  reaffirms the statutory ban on the use of Medicare data provided to the  qualified entity by CMS under this subpart for purposes other than those  referenced in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conditional approval process: Meet the eligibility and  operational and governance requirements, and fulfill all of the  application requirements to CMS' satisfaction, with the exception of  possession of sufficient claims data from other sources. Meeting these  requirements will result in a conditional approval as a qualified  entity. Entities gaining a conditional approval as a qualified entity  must meet the eligibility requirements related to claims data from other  sources the entity intends to combine with the Medicare data, agree to  pay a fee equal to the cost of CMS making the data available, and  execute a Data Use Agreement with CMS, that among other things,  reaffirms the statutory ban on the use of Medicare data provided to the  qualified entity by CMS under this subpart for purposes other than those  referenced in this subpart before receiving any Medicare data. If the  qualified entity is composed of lead entity with contractors, any  contractors that are anticipated to have access to the Medicare data  must also execute a Data Use Agreement with CMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duration of approval. CMS permits an entity to participate as a  qualified entity for a period of 3 years from the date of notification  of the application approval by CMS. The qualified entity must abide by  all CMS regulations and instructions. If the qualified entity wishes to  continue performing the tasks after the 3-year approval period, the  entity may re-apply for qualified entity status following the procedures  in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reporting period. A qualified entity must produce reports on the  performance of providers and suppliers at least annually, beginning in  the calendar year after they are approved by CMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The distribution of data--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial data release. Once CMS  fully approves a qualified entity under this subpart, the qualified  entity must pay a fee equal to the cost of CMS making data available.  After the qualified entity pays the fee, CMS will release the applicable  encrypted claims data, as well as a file that crosswalks the encrypted  beneficiary ID to the beneficiary name and the Medicare HICN. The data  will be the most recent data available, and will be limited to the  geographic spread of the qualified entity's other claims data, as  determined by CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subsequent data releases. After the first quarter of  participation, CMS will provide a qualified entity with the most recent  additional quarter of currently available data, as well as a table that  crosswalks the encrypted beneficiary ID to the beneficiary's name and  the Medicare HICN. Qualified entities are required to pay CMS a fee  equal to the cost of making data available before CMS will release the  most recent quarter of additional data to the qualified entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Re-application. A qualified entity that is in good standing may  re-apply for qualified entity status. A qualified   entity is considered to be in good standing if it has had no violations  of the requirements in this subpart or if the qualified entity is  addressing any past deficiencies either on its own or through the  implementation of a corrective action plan. To re-apply a qualified  entity must submit to CMS documentation of any changes to what was  included in its previously-approved application. A re-applicant must  submit this documentation at least 6 months before the end of its 3-year  approval period and will be able to continue to serve as a qualified  entity until the re-application is either approved or denied by CMS. If  the re-application is denied, CMS will terminate its relationship with  the qualified entity and the qualified entity will be subject to the  requirements for return or destruction of data at Sec. 401.721(b).</p>
