                                Sec. 1.112-1  Combat zone compensation of members of the Armed Forces.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Combat zone compensation exclusion--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amount excluded. In  addition to the exemptions and credits otherwise applicable, section 112  excludes from gross income the following compensation of members of the  Armed Forces:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Enlisted personnel. Compensation received for active service as  a member below the grade of commissioned officer in the Armed Forces of  the United States for any month during any part of which the member  served in a combat zone or was hospitalized at any place as a result of  wounds, disease, or injury incurred while serving in the combat zone.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Commissioned officers. Compensation not exceeding the monthly  dollar limit received for active service as a commissioned officer in  the Armed Forces of the United States for any month during any part of  which the officer served in a combat zone or was hospitalized at any  place as a result of wounds, disease, or injury incurred while serving  in the combat zone. The monthly dollar limit is the monthly amount  excludable from the officer's income under section 112(b) as amended.  Beginning in 1966, the monthly dollar limit for periods of active  service after 1965 became $500. As of September 10, 1993, the monthly  dollar limit continues to be $500.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Time limits on exclusion during hospitalization. Compensation  received for service for any month of hospitalization that begins more  than 2 years after the date specified by the President in an Executive  Order as the date of the termination of combatant activities in the  combat zone cannot be excluded under section 112. Furthermore,  compensation received while hospitalized after January 1978 for wounds,  disease, or injury incurred in the Vietnam combat zone designated by  Executive Order 11216 cannot be excluded under section 112.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Special terms. A commissioned warrant officer is not a  commissioned officer under section 112(b) and is entitled to the  exclusion allowed to enlisted personnel under section 112(a).  Compensation, for the purpose of section 112, does not include pensions  and retirement pay. Armed Forces of the United States is defined (and  members of the Armed Forces are described) in section 7701(a)(15).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Military compensation only. Only compensation paid by the Armed   Forces of the United States to members of the Armed Forces can be  excluded under section 112, except for compensation paid by an agency or  instrumentality of the United States or by an international organization  to a member of the Armed Forces whose military active duty status  continues during the member's assignment to the agency or  instrumentality or organization on official detail. Compensation paid by  other employers (whether private enterprises or governmental entities)  to members of the Armed Forces cannot be excluded under section 112 even  if the payment is made to supplement the member's military compensation  or is labeled by the employer as compensation for active service in the  Armed Forces of the United States. Compensation paid to civilian  employees of the federal government, including civilian employees of the  Armed Forces, cannot be excluded under section 112, except as provided  in section 112(d)(2) (which extends the exclusion to compensation of  civilian employees of the federal government in missing status due to  the Vietnam conflict).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Service in combat zone--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Active service. The exclusion under  section 112 applies only if active service is performed in a combat  zone. A member of the Armed Forces is in active service if the member is  actually serving in the Armed Forces of the United States. Periods  during which a member of the Armed Forces is absent from duty on account  of sickness, wounds, leave, internment by the enemy, or other lawful  cause are periods of active service. A member of the Armed Forces in  active service in a combat zone who becomes a prisoner of war or missing  in action in the combat zone is deemed, for the purpose of section 112,  to continue in active service in the combat zone for the period for  which the member is treated as a prisoner of war or as missing in action  for military pay purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Combat zone status. Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f)  of this section, service is performed in a combat zone only if it is  performed in an area which the President of the United States has  designated by Executive Order, for the purpose of section 112, as an  area in which Armed Forces of the United States are or have been engaged  in combat, and only if it is performed on or after the date designated  by the President by Executive Order as the date of the commencing of  combatant activities in that zone and on or before the date designated  by the President by Executive Order as the date of the termination of  combatant activities in that zone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Partial month service. If a member of the Armed Forces serves in  a combat zone for any part of a month, the member is entitled to the  exclusion for that month to the same extent as if the member has served  in that zone for the entire month. If a member of the Armed Forces is  hospitalized for a part of a month as a result of wounds, disease, or  injury incurred while serving in that zone, the member is entitled to  the exclusion for the entire month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Payment time and place. The time and place of payment are  irrelevant in considering whether compensation is excludable under  section 112; rather, the time and place of the entitlement to  compensation determine whether the compensation is excludable under  section 112. Thus, compensation can be excluded under section 112  whether or not it is received outside a combat zone, or while the  recipient is hospitalized, or in a year different from that in which the  service was rendered for which the compensation is paid, provided that  the member's entitlement to the compensation fully accrued in a month  during which the member served in the combat zone or was hospitalized as  a result of wounds, disease, or injury incurred while serving in the  combat zone. For this purpose, entitlement to compensation fully accrues  upon the completion of all actions required of the member to receive the  compensation. Compensation received by a member of the Armed Forces for  services rendered while in active service can be excluded under section  112 even though payment is received subsequent to discharge or release  from active service. Compensation credited to a deceased member's  account for a period subsequent to the established date of the member's  death and received by the member's estate can be excluded from the gross  income of the estate under section 112 to the same extent   that it would have been excluded from the gross income of the member had  the member lived and received the compensation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examples of combat zone compensation. The rules of this section  are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. On January 5, outside of a combat zone, an enlisted  member received basic pay for active duty services performed from the  preceding December 1 through December 31. On December 4 (and no other  date), the member performed services within a combat zone. The member  may exclude from income the entire payment received on January 5,  although the member served in the combat zone only one day during  December, received the payment outside of the combat zone, and received  the payment in a year other than the year in which the combat zone  services were performed.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. From March through December, an enlisted member became  entitled to 25 days of annual leave while serving in a combat zone. The  member used all 25 days of leave in the following year. The member may  exclude from income the compensation received for those 25 days, even if  the member performs no services in the combat zone in the year the  compensation is received.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. From March through December, a commissioned officer  became entitled to 25 days of annual leave while serving in a combat  zone. During that period the officer also received basic pay of $1,000  per month from which the officer excluded from income $500 per month  (exhausting the monthly dollar limit under section 112 for that period).  The officer used all 25 days of leave in the following year. The officer  may not exclude from income any compensation received in the following  year related to those 25 days of leave, since the officer had already  excluded from income the maximum amount of combat zone compensation for  the period in which the leave was earned.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. In November, while serving in a combat zone, an enlisted  member competing for a cash award submitted an employee suggestion.  After November, the member neither served in a combat zone nor was  hospitalized for wounds incurred in the combat zone. In June of the  following year, the member's suggestion was selected as the winner of  the competition and the award was paid. The award can be excluded from  income as combat zone compensation although granted and received outside  of the combat zone, since the member completed the necessary action to  win the award (submission of the suggestion) in a month during which the  member served in the combat zone.</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. In July, while serving in a combat zone, an enlisted  member voluntarily reenlisted. After July, the member neither served in  a combat zone nor was hospitalized for wounds incurred in the combat  zone. In February of the following year, the member received a bonus as  a result of the July reenlistment. The reenlistment bonus can be  excluded from income as combat zone compensation although received  outside of the combat zone, since the member completed the necessary  action for entitlement to the reenlistment bonus in a month during which  the member served in the combat zone.</p><p class="depth3">Example 6. In July, while serving outside a combat zone, an enlisted  member voluntarily reenlisted. In February of the following year, the  member, while performing services in a combat zone, received a bonus as  a result of the July reenlistment. The reenlistment bonus cannot be  excluded from income as combat zone compensation although received while  serving in the combat zone, since the member completed the necessary  action for entitlement to the reenlistment bonus in a month during which  the member had neither served in the combat zone nor was hospitalized  for wounds incurred while serving in a combat zone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hospitalization--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Presumption of combat zone injury. If an  individual is hospitalized for wound, disease, or injury while serving  in a combat zone, the wound, disease, or injury will be presumed to have  been incurred while serving in a combat zone, unless the contrary  clearly appears. In certain cases, however, a wound, disease, or injury  may have been incurred while serving in a combat zone even though the  individual was not hospitalized for it while so serving. In exceptional  cases, a wound, disease, or injury will not have been incurred while  serving in a combat zone even though the individual was hospitalized for  it while so serving.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Length of hospitalization. An individual is hospitalized only  until the date the individual is discharged from the hospital.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples of combat zone injury. The rules of this paragraph (c)  are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. An individual is hospitalized for a disease in the combat  zone where the individual has been serving for three weeks. The  incubation period of the disease is two to four weeks. The disease is  incurred while serving in the combat zone.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that the  incubation period of the disease is one year. The disease is not  incurred while serving in the combat zone.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. A member of the Air Force, stationed outside the combat  zone, is shot while participating in aerial combat over the combat zone,  but is not hospitalized until returning to the home base. The injury is  incurred while serving in a combat zone.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. An individual is hospitalized for a disease three weeks  after having departed from a combat zone. The incubation period of the  disease is two to four weeks. The disease is incurred while serving in a  combat zone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Married members. The exclusion under section 112 applies without  regard to the marital status of the recipient of the compensation. If  both spouses meet the requirements of the statute, then each spouse is  entitled to the benefit of an exclusion. In the case of a husband and  wife domiciled in a State recognized for Federal income tax purposes as  a community property State, any exclusion from gross income under  section 112 operates before apportionment of the gross income of the  spouses under community property law. For example, a husband and wife  are domiciled in a community property State and the member spouse is  entitled, as a commissioned officer, to the benefit of the exclusion  under section 112(b) of $500 for each month. The member receives $7,899  as compensation for active service for 3 months in a combat zone. Of  that amount, $1,500 is excluded from gross income under section 112(b)  and $6,399 is taken into account in determining the gross income of both  spouses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Service in area outside combat zone--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Combat zone treatment.  For purposes of section 112, a member of the Armed Forces who performs  military service in an area outside the area designated by Executive  Order as a combat zone is deemed to serve in that combat zone while the  member's service is in direct support of military operations in that  zone and qualifies the member for the special pay for duty subject to  hostile fire or imminent danger authorized under section 310 of title 37  of the United States Code, as amended (37 U.S.C. 310) (hostile fire/ imminent danger pay).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> are based on the following circumstances: Certain  areas, airspace, and adjacent waters are designated as a combat zone for  purposes of section 112 as of May 1. Some members of the Armed Forces  are stationed in the combat zone; others are stationed in two foreign  countries outside the combat zone, named Nearby Country and Destination  Country.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. B is a member of an Armed Forces ground unit stationed in  the combat zone. On May 31, B's unit crosses into Nearby Country. B  performs military service in Nearby Country in direct support of the  military operations in the combat zone from June 1 through June 8 that  qualifies B for hostile fire/imminent danger pay. B does not return to  the combat zone during June. B is deemed to serve in the combat zone  from June 1 through June 8. Accordingly, B is entitled to the exclusion  under section 112 for June. Of course, B is also entitled to the  exclusion for any month (May, in this example) in which B actually  served in the combat zone.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. B is a member of an Armed Forces ground unit stationed in  the combat zone. On May 31, B's unit crosses into Nearby Country. On  June 1, B is wounded while performing military service in Nearby Country  in direct support of the military operations in the combat zone that  qualifies B for hostile fire/imminent danger pay. On June 2, B is  transferred for treatment to a hospital in the United States. B is  hospitalized from June through October for those wounds. B is deemed to  have incurred the wounds while serving in the combat zone on June 1.  Accordingly, B is entitled to the exclusion under section 112 for June  through October. Of course, B is also entitled to the exclusion for any  month (May, in this example) in which B actually served in the combat  zone.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. B is stationed in Nearby Country for the entire month of  June as a member of a ground crew servicing combat aircraft operating in  the combat zone. B's service in Nearby Country during June does not  qualify B for hostile fire/imminent danger pay. Accordingly, B is not  deemed to serve in the combat zone during June and is not entitled to  the exclusion under section 112 for that month.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. B is assigned to an air unit stationed in Nearby Country  for the entire month of June. In June, members of air units of the Armed  Forces stationed in Nearby Country fly combat and supply missions into  and over Destination Country in direct support of military operations in  the combat zone. B flies combat missions over Destination Country from  Nearby Country from June 1 through June 8. B's service qualifies B for  hostile fire/imminent danger pay. Accordingly, B is deemed to serve in  the combat zone during June and is entitled to the exclusion under  section 112. The result would   be the same if B were to fly supply missions into Destination Country  from Nearby Country in direct support of operations in the combat zone  qualifying B for hostile fire/imminent danger pay.</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. Assigned to an air unit stationed in Nearby Country, B  was killed in June when B's plane crashed on returning to the airbase in  Nearby Country. B was performing military service in direct support of  the military operations in the combat zone at the time of B's death. B's  service also qualified B for hostile fire/imminent danger pay. B is  deemed to have died while serving in the combat zone or to have died as  a result of wounds, disease, or injury incurred while serving in the  combat zone for purposes of section 692(a) and section 692(b) (providing  relief from certain income taxes for members of the Armed Forces dying  in a combat zone or as a result of wounds, disease, or injury incurred  while serving in a combat zone) and section 2201 (providing relief from  certain estate taxes for members of the Armed Forces dying in a combat  zone or by reason of combat-zone-incurred wounds). The result would be  the same if B's mission had been a supply mission instead of a combat  mission.</p><p class="depth3">Example 6. In June, B was killed as a result of an off-duty  automobile accident while leaving the airbase in Nearby Country shortly  after returning from a mission over Destination Country. At the time of  B's death, B was not performing military duty qualifying B for hostile  fire/imminent danger pay. B is not deemed to have died while serving in  the combat zone or to have died as the result of wounds, disease, or  injury incurred while serving in the combat zone. Accordingly, B does  not qualify for the benefits of section 692(a), section 692(b), or  section 2201.</p><p class="depth3">Example 7. B performs military service in Nearby Country from June 1  through June 8 in direct support of the military operations in the  combat zone. Nearby Country is designated as an area in which members of  the Armed Forces qualify for hostile fire/imminent danger pay due to  imminent danger, even though members in Nearby Country are not subject  to hostile fire. B is deemed to serve in the combat zone from June 1  through June 8. Accordingly, B is entitled to the exclusion under  section 112 for June.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Nonqualifying presence in combat zone--(1) Inapplicability of  exclusion. The following members of the Armed Forces are not deemed to  serve in a combat zone within the meaning of section 112(a)(1) or  section 112(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> or to be hospitalized as a result of wounds, disease,  or injury incurred while serving in a combat zone within the meaning of  section 112(a)(2) or section 112(b)(2)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Members present in a combat zone while on leave from a duty  station located outside a combat zone;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Members who pass over or through a combat zone during the  course of a trip between two points both of which lie outside a combat  zone; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Members present in a combat zone solely for their own personal  convenience.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions for temporary duty or special pay. Paragraph (f)(1)  of this section does not apply to members of the Armed Forces who--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are assigned on official temporary duty to a combat zone  (including official temporary duty to the airspace of a combat zone); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Qualify for hostile fire/imminent danger pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> are based on the following  circumstances: Certain areas, airspace, and adjacent waters are  designated as a combat zone for purposes of section 112 as of May 1.  Some members of the Armed Forces are stationed in the combat zone;  others are stationed in two foreign countries outside the combat zone,  named Nearby Country and Destination Country.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. B is a member of the Armed Forces assigned to a unit  stationed in Nearby Country. On June 1, B voluntarily visits a city  within the combat zone while on leave. B is not deemed to serve in a  combat zone since B is present in a combat zone while on leave from a  duty station located outside a combat zone.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. B is a member of the Armed Forces assigned to a unit  stationed in Nearby Country. During June, B takes authorized leave and  elects to spend the leave period by visiting a city in the combat zone.  While on leave in the combat zone, B is subject to hostile fire  qualifying B for hostile fire/imminent danger pay. Although B is present  in the combat zone while on leave from a duty station outside the combat  zone, B qualifies for the exclusion under section 112 because B  qualifies for hostile fire/imminent danger pay while in the combat zone.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. B is a member of the Armed Forces assigned to a ground  unit stationed in the combat zone. During June, B takes authorized leave  and elects to spend the leave period in the combat zone. B is not on  leave from a duty station located outside a combat   zone, nor is B present in a combat zone solely for B's own personal  convenience. Accordingly, B's combat zone tax benefits continue while B  is on leave in the combat zone.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. B is assigned as a navigator to an air unit stationed in  Nearby Country. On June 4, during the course of a flight between B's  home base in Nearby Country and another base in Destination Country, the  aircraft on which B serves as a navigator flies over the combat zone. B  is not on official temporary duty to the airspace of the combat zone and  does not qualify for hostile fire/imminent danger pay as a result of the  flight. Accordingly, B is not deemed to serve in a combat zone since B  passes over the combat zone during the course of a trip between two  points both of which lie outside the combat zone without either being on  official temporary duty to the combat zone or qualifying for hostile  fire/imminent danger pay.</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. B is a member of the Armed Forces assigned to a unit  stationed in Nearby Country. B enters the combat zone on a 3-day pass. B  is not on official temporary duty and does not qualify for hostile fire/ imminent danger pay while present in the combat zone. Accordingly, B is  not deemed to serve in a combat zone since B is present in the combat  zone solely for B's own personal convenience.</p><p class="depth3">Example 6. B, stationed in Nearby Country, is a military courier  assigned on official temporary duty to deliver military pouches in the  combat zone and in Destination Country. On June 1, B arrives in the  combat zone from Nearby Country, and on June 2, B departs for  Destination Country. Although B passes through the combat zone during  the course of a trip between two points outside the combat zone, B is  nevertheless deemed to serve in a combat zone while in the combat zone  because B is assigned to the combat zone on official temporary duty.</p><p class="depth3">Example 7. B is a member of an Armed Forces ground unit stationed in  Nearby Country. On June 1, B took authorized leave and elected to spend  the leave period by visiting a city in the combat zone. On June 2, while  on leave in the combat zone, B was wounded by hostile fire qualifying B  for hostile fire/imminent danger pay. On June 3, B was transferred for  treatment to a hospital in the United States. B is hospitalized from  June through October for those wounds. Although B was present in the  combat zone while on leave from a duty station outside the combat zone,  B is deemed to have incurred the wounds while serving in the combat zone  on June 2, because B qualified for hostile fire/imminent danger pay  while in the combat zone. Accordingly, B is entitled to the exclusion  under section 112 for June through October.</p><p class="depth3">Example 8. The facts are the same as in Example 7 except that B dies  on September 1 as a result of the wounds incurred in the combat zone. B  is deemed to have died as a result of wounds, disease, or injury  incurred while serving in the combat zone for purposes of section 692(a)  and section 692(b) (providing relief from certain income taxes for  members of the Armed Forces dying in a combat zone or as a result of  wounds, disease, or injury incurred while serving in a combat zone) and  section 2201 (providing relief from certain estate taxes for members of  the Armed Forces dying in a combat zone or by reason of combat-zone- incurred wounds).
