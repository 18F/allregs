                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The statutes administered by the Commission provide generally  (1) for the filing with it of certain statements, such as registration  statements, periodic and ownership reports, and proxy solicitation  material, and for the filing of certain plans of reorganization,  applications and declarations seeking Commission approvals; (2) for  Commission determination through formal procedures of matters initiated  by private parties or by the Commission; (3) for the investigation and  examination of persons and records where necessary to carry out the  purposes of the statutes and for enforcement of statutory provisions;  and (4) for the adoption of rules and regulations where necessary to  effectuate the purposes of the statutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the Commission's rules of practice set forth in  part 201 of this chapter, the Commission has promulgated rules and  regulations pursuant to the several statutes it administers (parts 230,  240, 260, 270 and 275 of this chapter). These parts contain substantive  provisions and include as well numerous provisions detailing the  procedure for meeting specific standards embodied in the statutes. The  Commission's rules and regulations under each of the statutes are  available in pamphlet form upon request to the Superintendent of  Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The statutes and the published rules, regulations and forms  thereunder prescribe the course and method of formal procedures to be  followed in Commission proceedings. These are supplemented where  feasible by certain informal procedures designed to aid the public and  facilitate the execution of the Commission's functions. There follows a  brief description of procedures generally followed by the Commission  which have not been formalized in rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The informal procedures of the Commission are largely concerned  with the rendering of advice and assistance by the Commission's staff to  members of the public dealing with the Commission. While opinions  expressed by members of the staff do not constitute an official  expression of the Commission's views, they represent the views of  persons who are continuously working with the provisions of the statute  involved. And any statement by the director, associate director,  assistant director, chief accountant, chief counsel, or chief financial  analyst of a division can be relied upon as representing the views of  that division. In certain instances an informal statement of the views  of the Commission may be obtained. The staff, upon request or on its own  motion, will generally present questions to the Commission which involve  matters of substantial importance and where the issues are novel or  highly complex, although the granting of a request for an informal  statement by the Commission is entirely within its discretion.
