Manufacturers and importers shall  determine the types and frequency of testing for their own reasonable  testing programs. A reasonable testing program should be sufficiently  stringent that it will detect any variations in production or  performance during the production interval that would cause any lighters  to fail to meet the requirements of the standard.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All reasonable testing programs shall include qualification  tests, which must be performed on surrogates of each model of lighter  produced, or to be produced, to demonstrate that the product is capable  of passing the tests prescribed by the standard (see Sec. 1210.14), and  production tests, which must be performed during appropriate production  intervals as long as the product is being manufactured (see Sec.  1210.16).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Corrective action and/or additional testing must be performed  whenever certification tests of samples of the product give results that  do not provide a high degree of assurance that all lighters manufactured  during the applicable production interval will pass the tests of the  standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Testing by third parties. At the option of the manufacturer or  importer, some or all of the testing of each lighter or lighter  surrogate may be performed by a commercial testing laboratory or other  third party. However, the manufacturer or importer must ensure that all  certification testing has been properly performed with passing results  and that all records of such tests are maintained in accordance with  Sec. 1210.17 of this subpart.</p>
