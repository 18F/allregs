                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of an acquisition strategy is to describe the overall approach for acquiring capabilities needed to fulfill investment/programmatic objectives. Acquisition strategy development requires identification of issues and risks that might impact an acquisition(s) to allow early action to eliminate or mitigate the issues and risks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An acquisition strategy differs from an AP with respect to the timing of its development and the level of detail required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An acquisition strategy is established at the inception (concept phase) of an investment/acquisition to support the business case, identify and mitigate risks, and begin the acquisition planning process. An acquisition strategy addresses the major issues surrounding business objectives, competitive forces, and various risks that need to be considered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An acquisition strategy is a living document used throughout the investment's life-cycle. It should be continuously updated with the active involvement of the Program or Project Manager and the Contracting Officer at appropriate points, as plans for the investment/acquisition mature. An acquisition strategy ultimately will result in an AP--see 307.71.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An AP, which is required to support proposed acquisitions expected to exceed $500,000 (inclusive of options, with certain exceptions)--see 307.7101, is developed closer to the time of solicitation. The AP addresses not only those issues in the acquisition strategy, but also the tactical details of how the acquisition will be executed.</p>
