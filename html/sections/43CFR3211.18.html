pay a nominal fee established under MMS rules at 30 CFR 206.366.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For leases issued before August 8, 2005, whose royalty terms are not modified to the terms prescribed in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 under Sec. 3212.25, and for leases issued in response to applications pending on that date for which the lessee does not make an election under Sec. 3200.8(b), the royalty rate is the rate prescribed in the lease instrument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of this section, direct use of geothermal resources includes generation of electricity that is not sold commercially and that is used solely for the operation of a facility unrelated to commercial electrical generation.</p>
