                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If your boiler has a heat input capacity of 10 million British thermal units per hour or greater, you must conduct all applicable performance (stack) tests according to Sec. 63.11212 on a triennial basis, except as specified in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Triennial performance tests must be completed no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When demonstrating initial compliance with the PM emission limit, if your boiler's performance test results show that your PM emissions are equal to or less than half of the PM emission limit, you do not need to conduct further performance tests for PM but must continue to comply with all applicable operating limits and monitoring requirements. If your initial performance test results show that your PM emissions are greater than half of the PM emission limit, you must conduct subsequent performance tests as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you demonstrate compliance with the mercury emission limit based on fuel analysis, you must conduct a fuel analysis according to Sec. 63.11213 for each type of fuel burned as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. If you plan to burn a new type of fuel or fuel mixture, you must conduct a fuel analysis before burning the new type of fuel or mixture in your boiler. You must recalculate the mercury emission rate using Equation 1 of Sec. 63.11211. The recalculated mercury emission rate must be less than the applicable emission limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When demonstrating initial compliance with the mercury emission limit, if the mercury constituents in the fuel or fuel mixture are measured to be equal to or less than half of the mercury emission limit, you do not need to conduct further fuel analysis sampling but must continue to comply with all applicable operating limits and monitoring requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When demonstrating initial compliance with the mercury emission limit, if the mercury constituents in the fuel or fuel mixture are greater than half of the mercury emission limit, you must conduct quarterly sampling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For existing affected boilers that have not operated since the previous compliance demonstration and more than 3 years have passed since the previous compliance demonstration, you must complete your subsequent compliance demonstration no later than 180 days after the re-start of the affected boiler.
