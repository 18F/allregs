                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A power ventilation system shall be provided for compartments  containing pumps, compressors, pipes, control spaces, etc. connected  with the cargo handling facilities. These compartments shall be  ventilated in such a way as to remove vapors from points near the floor  level or bilges, or other areas where vapor concentrations may be  expected. The compartments shall be equipped with power ventilation of  the exhaust type having capacity sufficient to effect a complete change  of air in not more than 3 minutes equal to the volume of the compartment  and associated trunks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The power ventilation units shall not produce a source of vapor  ignition in either the compartment or the ventilation system associated  with the compartment. Inlets to exhaust ducts shall be provided and  located at points where concentrations of vapors may be expected.  Ventilation from the weather deck shall be provided. Ventilation outlets  shall terminate away from any openings to the interior part of the  vessel a lateral distance at least equal to that specified in  Sec. 38.20-1(a). These outlets shall be so located as to minimize the  possibility of recirculating contaminated air through the compartment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Means shall be provided for purging the following spaces of  cargo vapors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The space surrounding nonpressure vessel type tanks, i.e.,  within the secondary barrier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The space surrounding pressure-vessel type tanks whose piping  connections are below the weather deck in accordance with Sec. 38.10- 1(h).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The space surrounding tanks whose manhole openings are below the  weather deck in accordance with Sec. 38.05-10(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Power ventilation shall be provided for each auxiliary machinery  or   working space located on and accessible from the cargo handling deck.  Such ventilation systems shall be designed to preclude the entry of  cargo vapors into the space via the open access or the ventilation  system itself.
