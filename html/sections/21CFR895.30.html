                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Commissioner may declare a proposed regulation under Sec.  895.21(d) to be effective upon its publication in the Federal Register  and until the effective date of any final action taken respecting the  regulation if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commissioner determines, on the basis of all available data  and information, that the deception or risk of illness or injury  associated with use of the device that is subject to the regulation  presents an unreasonable, direct, and substantial danger to the health  of individuals, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before the date of the publication of such regulation, the  Commissioner notifies the domestic manufacturer and importer, if any, of  the device that the regulation is to be made so effective. If necessary,  the Commissioner may also notify the distributor or any other  responsible person(s). In addition, the Commissioner will attempt to  notify any foreign manufacturer when the name and address of the foreign  manufacturer are readily available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This procedure may be used when the Commissioner determines that  the potential or actual injury involved is a serious one that the  Commissioner believes will endanger the health of individuals who have  been, or will be, exposed to the device. In assessing the degree of  danger, the Commissioner need not find that the danger is immediate, and  it shall be sufficient for the Commissioner to determine that the danger  may involve a serious long-term risk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the Commissioner makes a proposed regulation effective in  accordance with this section, the Commissioner will, as expeditiously as  possible, give interested persons prompt   notice of this action in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After the hearing, if any, and after considering any written  comments submitted on the proposal and any additional available  information and data, the Commissioner will as expeditiously as possible  either affirm, modify, or revoke the proposed regulation making the  device a banned device. If the Commissioner decides to affirm or modify  the proposed regulation to make a device a banned device, the  Commissioner will amend subpart B by adding the name or description of  the device, or both, to the list of banned devices. If the Commissioner  decides to revoke a proposed regulation making a device a banned device,  a notice of termination of rulemaking proceedings and reasons therefor  will be published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Commissioner may declare the special effective date provided  by this section to be in effect after the publication of a proposed  regulation under Sec. 895.21(d), if, based on new information, or upon  reconsideration of previously available information, the Commissioner  makes the determination and provides the appropriate notices and an  opportunity for a hearing in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Those devices that have been named banned devices under Sec.  895.30 and that have already been sold to the public may be subject to  relabeling by the manufacturer, distributor, importer, or any other  person(s) responsible for the labeling of the device or may be subject  to the provisions of section 518(a) or (b) of the act.
