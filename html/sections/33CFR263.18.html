Shortening of these objectives is encouraged for specific studies and  projects when appropriate. However, high standards of planning, design  and construction are not to be sacrificed. Attainment of completion-time  objectives through intensive management is to be a major concern for  those elements and individuals given Program management responsibilities  in Sec. 263.16 of this regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Program Authorities, Completion Times in Months ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">205, 107,               Emergency</p><p class="depth0">103, and   208 and 14   14 and 3</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Completion of recon and                    2           1           2</p><p class="depth2">submission of funding request or</p><p class="depth2">negative report to OCE.............
