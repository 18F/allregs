                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Areas closed because of environmental degradation. Certain areas are closed to all surfclam and ocean quahog fishing because of adverse environmental conditions. These areas will remain closed until the Regional Administrator determines that the adverse environmental conditions no longer exist. If additional areas are identified by the Regional Administrator as being contaminated by the introduction or presence of hazardous materials or pollutants, they may be closed by the Regional Administrator in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The areas closed are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Boston Foul Ground. The waste disposal site known as the ``Boston Foul Ground'' and located at 422536" N. lat., 703500" W. long., with a radius of 1 nm (1.61 km) in every direction from that point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> New York Bight. The polluted area and waste disposal site known as the ``New York Bight'' and located at 402504" N. lat., 734238" W. long., and with a radius of 6 nm (9.66 km) in every direction from that point, extending further northwestward, westward and southwestward between a line from a point on the arc at 403100" N. lat., 734338" W. long., directly northward toward Atlantic Beach Light in New York to the limit of the state territorial waters of New York; and a line from the point on the arc at 401948" N. lat., 734542" W. long., to a point at the limit of the state territorial waters of New Jersey at 401400" N. lat., 735542" W. long.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 106 Dumpsite. The toxic industrial site known as the ``106 Dumpsite'' and located between 384000" and 390000" N. lat., and between 720000" and 723000" W. long.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Georges Bank. The paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) contaminated area, which is located on Georges Bank, and is located east of 69 W. long., and south of 4220 N. lat. is closed to the harvest of surfclams and ocean quahogs. A portion of the Georges Bank Closed Area is open to

harvest surfclams and ocean quahogs provided the vessel complies with the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. The open portion of the Georges Bank Closed Area is defined by straight lines connecting the following points in the order stated:</p><p class="depth3">Open Portion of the Georges Bank Closed Area------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Point                     N.

A vessel may fish in the open portion of the Georges Bank Closed Area as specified in this paragraph (a)(4), provided it complies with the following terms and conditions:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A valid letter of authorization issued by the Regional Administrator must be onboard the vessel; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The vessel must adhere to the terms and conditions of the PSP testing protocol as adopted into the National Shellfish Sanitation Program by the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference. All surfclams and ocean quahogs harvested from the area must be handled in accordance with the terms and conditions of the protocol from the first point of harvest through completion of testing and release by the State Shellfish Control Authority as required by the PSP testing protocol; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Prior to leaving port at the start of a fishing trip, the vessel's owner or operator must declare its intent to fish in the area through the vessel's vessel monitoring system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Areas closed because of small surfclams. Areas may be closed because they contain small surfclams.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Closure. The Regional Administrator may close an area to surfclams and ocean quahog fishing if he/she determines, based on logbook entries, processors' reports, survey cruises, or other information, that the area contains surfclams of which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sixty percent or more are smaller than 4.5 inches (11.43 cm); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not more than 15 percent are larger than 5.5 inches (13.97 cm) in size.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reopening. The Regional Administrator may reopen areas or parts of areas closed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if he/she determines, based on survey cruises or other information, that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The average length of the dominant (in terms of weight) size class in the area to be reopened is equal to or greater than 4.75 inches (12.065 cm); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The yield or rate of growth of the dominant shell-length class in the area to be reopened would be significantly enhanced through selective, controlled, or limited harvest of surfclams in the area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure. (1) The Regional Administrator may hold a public hearing on the proposed closure or reopening of any area under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. The Regional Administrator shall publish notification in the Federal Register of any proposed area closure or reopening, including any restrictions on harvest in a reopened area. Comments on the proposed closure or reopening must be submitted to the Regional Administrator within 30 days after publication. The Regional Administrator shall consider all comments and publish the final notification of closure or reopening, and any restrictions on harvest, in the Federal Register. Any adjustment to harvest restrictions in a reopened area shall be made by notification in the Federal Register. The Regional Administrator shall send notice of any action under this paragraph (c)(1) to each surfclam and ocean quahog processor and to each surfclam and ocean quahog permit holder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Regional Administrator may hold a public hearing on the proposed closure or reopening of any area under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

If an extension of the

60-day closure period is necessary to protect the public health, the hearing and notice requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Areas closed due to the presence of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxin--(1) Maine mahogany quahog zone. The Maine mahogany quahog zone is closed to fishing for ocean quahogs except in those areas of the zone that are tested by the State of Maine and deemed to be within the requirements of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program and adopted by the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference as acceptable limits for the toxin responsible for PSP. Harvesting is allowed in such areas during the periods specified by the Maine Department of Marine Resources during which quahogs are safe for human consumption. For information regarding these areas contact the State of Maine Division of Marine Resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maine mahogany quahog zone.
