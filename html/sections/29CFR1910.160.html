If the container shows a loss in net content or weight of more than 5 percent, or a loss in pressure of more than 10 percent, it shall be subjected to maintenance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The employer shall assure that factory charged nonrefillable containers which have no means of pressure indication are weighed at least semi-annually. If a container shows a loss in net weight or more than 5 percent it shall be replaced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The employer shall assure that inspection and maintenance dates are recorded on the container, on a tag attached to the container, or in a central location.
