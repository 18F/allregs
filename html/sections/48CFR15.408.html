The requirement for submission  of certified cost or pricing data is met when all accurate certified  cost or pricing data reasonably available to the offeror have been  submitted, either actually or by specific identification, to the  Contracting Officer or an authorized representative. As later data come  into your possession, it should be submitted promptly to the Contracting  Officer in a manner that clearly shows how the data relate to the  offeror's price proposal. The requirement for submission of certified  cost or pricing data continues up to the time of agreement on price, or  an earlier date agreed upon between the parties if applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Note 2: By submitting your proposal, you grant the Contracting  Officer or an authorized representative the right to examine records  that formed the basis for the pricing proposal. That examination can  take place at any time before award. It may include those books,  records, documents, and other types of factual data (regardless of form  or whether the data are specifically referenced or included in the  proposal as the basis for pricing) that will permit an adequate  evaluation of the proposed price.</p><p class="depth0">I.

Cost Elements</p><p class="depth0">Depending on your system, you must provide breakdowns for the  following basic cost elements, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0">A. Materials and services. Provide a consolidated priced summary of  individual material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or  contract line items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor  quotes, invoice prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components,  assemblies, and services to be produced or performed by others. For all  items proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and  price. Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct  cost analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data  are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part of  your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts  expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-4. Submit the  subcontractor certified cost or pricing data and data other than  certified cost or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or  pricing data as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These  requirements also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit  certified cost or pricing data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adequate Price Competition. Provide data showing the degree of  competition and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness  of price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders,  material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate  threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-4 priced on the basis of adequate  price competition. For interorganizational transfers priced at other  than the cost of comparable competitive commercial work of the division,  subsidiary, or affiliate of the contractor, explain the pricing method  (see FAR 31.205-26(e)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All Other. Obtain certified cost or pricing data from  prospective sources for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts,  purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding the threshold set forth  in FAR 15.403-4 and not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403- 1(b) (i.e., adequate price competition, commercial items, prices set by  law or regulation or waiver). Also provide data showing the basis for  establishing source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a  summary of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing  data submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract,  or purchase order that is the lower of either $13.5 million or more, or  both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold  and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price. Also  submit any information reasonably required to explain your estimating  process (including the judgmental factors applied and the mathematical  or other methods used in the estimate, including those used in  projecting from known data, and the nature and amount of any  contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer may  require you to submit cost or pricing data in support   of proposals in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing  data must be accurate, complete and current as of the date of final  price agreement, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on  the prime contractor's Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The  prime contractor is responsible for updating a prospective  subcontractor's data. For standard commercial items fabricated by the  offeror that are generally stocked in inventory, provide a separate cost  breakdown, if priced based on cost. For interorganizational transfers  priced at cost, provide a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze  the certified cost or pricing data and submit the results of your  analysis of the prospective source's proposal. When submission of a  prospective source's certified cost or pricing data is required as  described in this paragraph, it must be included as part of your own  certified cost or pricing data. You must also submit any data other than  certified cost or pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either  actually or by specific identification, along with the results of any  analysis performed on that data.</p><p class="depth0">B. Direct Labor. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly,  etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category,  and furnish bases for estimates.</p><p class="depth0">C.

Royalties. If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the  following information on a separate page for each separate royalty or  license fee:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Name and address of licensor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Date of license agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Patent numbers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the  royalty is payable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each  contract item or component on which the royalty is payable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Unit price of contract item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Number of units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Total dollar amount of royalties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of  the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of  specific patents (see FAR 27.202 and 31.205-37).</p><p class="depth0">F.
