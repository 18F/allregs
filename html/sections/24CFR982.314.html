                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section states when a participant family may move to a new unit with continued tenant-based assistance:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When family may move. A family may move to a new unit if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The assisted lease for the old unit has terminated. This includes a termination because:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The PHA has terminated the HAP contract for the owner's breach; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The lease has terminated by mutual agreement of the owner and the tenant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner has given the tenant a notice to vacate, or has commenced an action to evict the tenant, or has obtained a court judgment or other process allowing the owner to evict the tenant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The tenant has given notice of lease termination (if the tenant has a right to terminate the lease on notice to the owner, for owner breach, or otherwise).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member. A PHA may not terminate assistance if the family, with or without prior notification to the PHA, already moved out of a unit in violation of the lease, if such move occurred to protect the health or safety of a family member who is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking and who reasonably believed he or she was imminently threatened by harm from further violence if he or she remained in the dwelling unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> How many moves. (1) A participant family may move one or more times with continued assistance under the program, either inside the PHA jurisdiction, or under the portability procedures. (See Sec. 982.353)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A participant family may move one or more times with continued assistance under the program, either inside the PHA jurisdiction, or under the portability procedures. (See Sec. 982.353)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The PHA may establish:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Policies that prohibit any move by the family during the initial lease term; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Policies that prohibit more than one move by the family during any one-year period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The above policies do not apply when the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The PHA policies may apply to moves within the PHA jurisdiction by a participant family, and to moves by a participant family outside the PHA jurisdiction under portability procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice that family wants to move. (1) If the family terminates the lease on notice to the owner, the family must give the PHA a copy of the notice at the same time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the family terminates the lease on notice to the owner, the family must give the PHA a copy of the notice at the same time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the family wants to move to a new unit, the family must notify the PHA and the owner before moving from the old unit. If the family wants to move to a new unit that is located outside the initial PHA jurisdiction, the notice to the initial PHA must specify the area where the family wants to move. See portability procedures in subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When PHA may deny permission to move. (1) The PHA may deny permission to move if the PHA does not have sufficient funding for continued assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The PHA may deny permission to move if the PHA does not have sufficient funding for continued assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At any time, the PHA may deny permission to move in accordance with Sec. 982.552 (grounds for denial or termination of assistance).
