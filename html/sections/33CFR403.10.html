                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The witnesses at the hearings shall be examined viva voce, but  the Board may, at any time, for sufficient reason, order that any  particular facts may be proved by affidavit or that the affidavit of any  witness may be read at the hearing, on such conditions as it may think  reasonable, or that any witness whose attendance ought, for some  sufficient reason to be dispensed with, be examined before a member of  the Board. The evidence taken before a member of the Board shall be  confined to the subject matter in question, and any objection to the  admission of evidence shall be noted by the member and dealt with by the  Board at the hearing. Such notice of the time and place of examination  as is prescribed shall be given to the parties. All examinations shall  be returned to the Board, and may without further proof be used in  evidence, saving all just exceptions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Board may, whenever it deems it advisable to do so, require  written briefs to be submitted by the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The hearing, when once commenced, shall proceed, so far as in  the opinion of the Board may be practicable, from day to day.
