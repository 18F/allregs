If a grants officer anticipates that an award is likely to generate program income after the end of the project period, the grants officer should indicate in the award document whether the recipient will have any obligation to the Federal Government with respect to such income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided

these costs have not been charged to the award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other than any program income excluded pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained by the recipient and used in one or more of the following ways, as specified in program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Added to funds committed to the project by the DoD Component and recipient and used to further eligible project or program objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs is based.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the terms and conditions of an award authorize the disposition of program income as described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, and stipulate a limit on the amounts that may be used in those ways, program income in excess of the stipulated limits shall be used in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In the event that the terms and conditions of the award do not specify how program income is to be used, paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall apply automatically to all projects or programs except research.
