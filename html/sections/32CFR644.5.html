                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Procedure. The procedure of the Corps of Engineers in acquiring the necessary land or interests therein to accommodate projects authorized by the Congress is to permit the reservation of the minerals in the land, unless the reservation is inimical to the operation of the project. In all cases wherein a reservation is permitted, the mineral interests are subordinated to the primary project purposes, including public access and preservation of environmental quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General. (1) The multiplicity of ownerships in mineral interests, the variety of minerals and the different methods of mineral exploration, recovery and production make it impracticable to define in advance specific guidelines concerning the reservation of mineral interests and their subordination to primary project purposes in any given project. The initial planning documents, real estate design memoranda, and master plans will fully discuss and consider the extent of acquisition and/or reservation of mineral interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Generally fee title to all subsurface interests will be acquired in areas required for all structures, areas required for project operations and public use including access, and in areas where the value of the subsurface interests is nominal. Reservation of coal, oil, gas and other minerals will be permitted whenever any aspect of mineral development will not interfere with project purposes. The reservation of mineral rights will be predicated upon the Government's right to so regulate their development as to eliminate any interference with project purposes and to minimize any adverse impact on the environment including aesthetic values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reservation of minerals. (1) When it has been determined that the reservation of minerals will not interfere with the purposes of the project, the minerals will be subordinated in accordance with the following guidelines:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The estate providing for the subordination will not be utilized unless approved by HQDA (DAEN-REA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any subordination agreement, together with additional regulations incorporated by reference, must clearly define:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The rights and obligations of the Government and the mineral owner, operator, and/or lessee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The control to be exercised over site development for mining purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Required land reclamation or restoration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Restrictions against pollution and degradation of project environment and aesthetics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Provisions for compliance inspection by the Government of all site development and mining activities over which the Government has control under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After execution of a subordination agreement as provided above, the District Engineer will develop a program for the surveillance of mineral activities at each project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The representatives of the Division and District Engineers are to be fully informed concerning the rights and responsibilities of the Government and the mineral owner and/or operator

under the terms of the estates acquired for the subordination of minerals, and will periodically inspect all mining activities to insure compliance with the terms of the subordination agreement and any plan incorporated by reference into such agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Off-project mineral activity. In connection with all drainage basins, where there is present or potential mineral activity upstream from a project or nearby lands outside the project limits, the District Engineer will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Establish and maintain liaison with Federal and State agencies having responsibility for the regulation of mineral activities and the control of environment in order to prevent adverse effects of mining on the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Institute a system for monitoring adverse effects on the project such as sedimentation and acid drainage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Take steps to insure that Corps personnel in charge of the project are familiar with State and Federal laws governing the control of mineral recovery and the environment, as well as the Federal or State agencies responsible for the enforcement of such laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Division and District Engineers are requested to use the Refuse Act of 1899 and any other legal remedies that may be appropriate in a particular situation in order to protect the interests of the United States and preserve the integrity of the project.</p>
