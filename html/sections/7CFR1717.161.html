After submitting an  application, borrowers shall promptly notify RUS of any changes or  events that materially affect the application or any information in the  application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In reviewing borrower requests for approval of mergers, RUS will  consider the likely effects of the action on the ability of the  successor to provide reliable electric service at reasonable cost to RE  Act beneficiaries and on the security of outstanding RUS loans. Among  the factors RUS will consider are whether the proposed merger is likely  to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contribute to greater operating efficiency and financial  soundness;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mitigate high electric rates and or rate disparity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Help borrowers to diversify their loads or otherwise hedge  risks;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Have beneficial effects on rural economic development in the  community served by the borrower, such as diversifying the economic base  or alleviating unemployment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provide other benefits consistent with the purposes of the RE  Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> RUS will not approve a merger if, in the sole judgment of the  Administrator, such action is likely to have an adverse effect on the  credit quality of outstanding loans made or guaranteed by the  Government. RUS will thoroughly review each request for approval of such  action, including review of the feasibility and security of outstanding  Government loans according to the standards in 7 CFR 1710.112 and  1710.113, respectively, and in other RUS regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> RUS will keep the borrowers apprised of the progress of their  applications.
