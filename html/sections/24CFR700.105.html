                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the definitions in section 802(k), the following definitions apply to CHSP:</p><p class="depth0">Activity of Daily Living (ADL) means an activity regularly necessary for personal care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The minimum requirements of ADLs include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Eating (may need assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food, but must be able to feed self);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Dressing (must be able to dress self, but may need occasional assistance);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Bathing (may need assistance in getting in and out of the shower or tub, but must be able to wash self);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> Grooming (may need assistance in washing hair, but must be able to take care of personal appearance);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(v)</em> Getting in and out of bed and chairs, walking, going outdoors, using the toilet; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(vi)</em> Household management activities (may need assistance in doing housework, grocery shopping or laundry, or getting to and from one location to another for activities such as going to the doctor and shopping, but must be mobile. The mobility requirement does not exclude persons in wheelchairs or those requiring mobility devices.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Each of the Activities of Daily Living noted in paragraph (1) of this definition includes a requirement that a person must be able to perform at a specified minimal level (e.g., to satisfy the eating ADL, the person must be able to feed himself or herself). The determination of whether a person meets this minimal level of performance must include consideration of those services that will be performed by a person's spouse, relatives or other attendants to be provided by the individual. For example, if a person requires assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food plus assistance in feeding himself or herself, the individual would meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy the eating ADL, if a spouse, relative or attendant provides assistance with feeding the person. Should such assistance become unavailable at any time, the owner is not obligated at any time to provide individualized services beyond those offered to the resident population in general. The Activities of Daily Living analysis is relevant only with regard to determination of a person's eligibility to receive supportive services paid for by CHSP and is not a determination of eligibility for occupancy;</p><p class="depth0">Adjusted income means adjusted income as defined in 24 CFR parts 813 or 913.</p><p class="depth0">Applicant means a State, Indian tribe, unit of general local government, public housing authority (PHA), Indian housing authority (IHA) or local nonprofit housing sponsor.
