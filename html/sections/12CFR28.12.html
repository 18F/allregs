                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approval and licensing requirements--(1) General. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a foreign bank shall submit an application to, and obtain prior approval from, the OCC before it:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a foreign bank shall submit an application to, and obtain prior approval from, the OCC before it:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Establishes a Federal branch or agency; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exercises fiduciary powers at a Federal branch.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Licensing. A foreign bank must receive a license from the OCC to open and operate its initial Federal branch or agency in the United States. A foreign bank that has a license to operate and is operating a full-service Federal branch need not obtain a new license for any additional Federal branches or agencies, or to upgrade or downgrade its operations in an existing Federal branch or agency. A foreign bank that only has a license to operate and is operating a limited Federal branch or Federal agency need not obtain a new license for any additional limited Federal branches or Federal agencies, or to convert a limited Federal branch into a Federal agency or a Federal agency into a limited Federal branch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards for approval. Generally, in reviewing an application by a foreign bank to establish a Federal branch or agency, the OCC considers:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the applicant foreign bank and the Federal branch or agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the foreign bank has furnished to the OCC the information the OCC requires to assess the application adequately, and provided the OCC with adequate assurances that information will be made available to the OCC on the operations or activities of the foreign bank or any of its affiliates that the OCC deems necessary to determine and enforce compliance with the IBA and other applicable Federal banking statutes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the foreign bank and its United States affiliates are in compliance with applicable United States law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The convenience and needs of the community to be served and the effects of the proposal on competition in the domestic and foreign commerce of the United States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> With respect to an application to establish a Federal branch or agency outside of the foreign bank's home state, whether the foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by its home country supervisor. The OCC, in its discretion, also may consider whether the foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by its home country supervisor when reviewing any other type of application to establish a Federal branch or agency; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Whether the home country supervisor has consented to the proposed establishment of the Federal branch or agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis. In determining whether a foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis, the OCC reviews various factors, including whether the foreign bank is supervised or regulated in a manner so that its home country supervisor receives sufficient information on the worldwide operations of the foreign bank to assess the foreign bank's overall financial condition and compliance with laws and regulations as specified in the FRB's Regulation K, 12 CFR 211.24.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conditions on approval. The OCC may impose conditions on its approval including a condition permitting future termination of activities based on the inability of the foreign bank to provide information on its activities, or those of its affiliate, that the OCC deems necessary to determine and enforce compliance with United States banking laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expedited review. Unless the OCC concludes that the filing presents significant supervisory or compliance concerns, or raises significant legal or policy issues, the OCC generally processes the following filings by an eligible foreign bank, as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, under expedited review procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Intrastate relocations. An application submitted by an eligible foreign bank to relocate a Federal branch or agency within a state is deemed approved by the OCC as of the seventh day after the close of the applicable public comment period in 12 CFR part 5, unless the OCC notifies the bank prior to that date that the filing is not eligible for expedited review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Written notice for an additional intrastate Federal branch or agency. (i) In a case where a foreign bank seeks to establish intrastate an additional Federal branch or agency, the foreign bank shall provide written notice 30 days in advance of the establishment of the intrastate Federal branch or agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In a case where a foreign bank seeks to establish intrastate an additional Federal branch or agency, the foreign bank shall provide written notice 30 days in advance of the establishment of the intrastate Federal branch or agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The OCC may waive the 30-day period required under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section if immediate action is required. The OCC also may suspend the notice period or require an application if the notification raises significant policy or supervisory concerns.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Expedited approval procedures for an interstate Federal branch or agency. An application submitted by an eligible foreign bank to establish and operate a de novo Federal branch or agency in any state outside the home state of the foreign bank is deemed conditionally approved by the OCC as of the 15th day after the close of the applicable public comment period, or the 45th day after the filing is received by the OCC, whichever is later, unless the OCC notifies the foreign bank prior to that date that the filing is not eligible for expedited review. In the event that the FRB has approved the application prior to the expiration of the period, then the OCC's approval shall be deemed a final approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Conversions. An application submitted by an eligible foreign bank to

establish a Federal branch or agency as defined in 12 CFR 28.11(f)(4) or (f)(6) is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 30th day after the OCC receives the filing, unless the OCC notifies the foreign bank prior to that date that the filing is not eligible for expedited review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Fiduciary powers. An application submitted by an eligible foreign bank to exercise fiduciary powers at an established Federal branch is deemed approved by the OCC 30 days after filing with the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the bank prior to that date that the filing is not eligible for expedited review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other filings. Any other application submitted by an eligible foreign bank may be approved by the OCC on an expedited basis as described in the Manual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Eligible foreign bank. For purposes of this section, a foreign bank is an eligible foreign bank if each Federal branch and agency of the foreign bank or, if the foreign bank has no Federal branches or agencies and is engaging in an establishment of a Federal branch or agency as defined in 12 CFR 28.11(f)(4), each state branch and agency:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has a composite rating of 1 or 2 under the interagency rating system for United States branches and agencies of foreign banks;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is not subject to a cease and desist order, consent order, formal written agreement, Prompt Corrective Action directive (see 12 CFR part 6) or, if subject to such order, agreement, or directive, is informed in writing by the OCC that the Federal branch or agency may be treated as an ``eligible foreign bank'' for purposes of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has, if applicable, a Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), 12 U.S.C. 2906, rating of ``Outstanding'' or ``Satisfactory''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> After-the-fact approval. Unless otherwise provided by the OCC, a foreign bank proposing to establish a Federal branch or agency through the acquisition of, or merger or consolidation with, a foreign bank that has an office in the United States, may proceed with the transaction before an application to establish the Federal branch or agency has been filed or acted upon, if the applicant:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gives the OCC reasonable advance notice of the proposed acquisition, merger, or consolidation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to consummation of the acquisition, merger, or consolidation, commits in writing to comply with the OCC application procedures within a reasonable period of time, or has already submitted an application; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Commits in writing to abide by the OCC's decision on the application, including a decision to terminate activities of the Federal branch or agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> After-the-fact notice for an eligible foreign bank. Unless otherwise provided by the OCC, a foreign bank proposing to establish a Federal branch or agency through the acquisition of, or merger or consolidation with, a foreign bank that has an existing U.S. bank subsidiary or a Federal or state branch or agency may proceed with the transaction and provide after-the-fact notice to the OCC within 14 days of the transaction, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The resulting bank is an ``eligible foreign bank'' under paragraph (f) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No Federal branch established by the transaction accepts deposits that are insured by the FDIC pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contraction of operations. A foreign bank shall provide written notice to the OCC within 10 days after converting a Federal branch into a limited Federal branch or Federal agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Procedures for approval. A foreign bank shall file an application for approval pursuant to this section in accordance with 12 CFR part 5 and the Manual. The OCC reserves the right to adopt materially different procedures for a particular filing, or class of filings, pursuant to 12 CFR 5.2(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Other applications accepted. As provided in 12 CFR 5.4(c), the OCC may accept an application or other filing submitted to another U.S. Government agency that covers the proposed activity or transaction and contains substantially the same information as required by the OCC.
