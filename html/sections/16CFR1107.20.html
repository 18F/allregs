The number of  samples selected must be sufficient to provide a high degree of  assurance that the tests conducted for certification purposes accurately  demonstrate the ability of the children's product to meet all applicable  children's product safety rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the manufacturing process for a children's product  consistently creates finished products that are uniform in composition  and quality, a manufacturer may submit fewer samples to provide a high  degree of assurance that the finished product complies with the  applicable children's product safety rules. If the manufacturing process  for a children's product results in variability in the composition or  quality of children's products, a manufacturer may need to submit more  samples to provide a high degree of assurance that the finished product  complies with the applicable children's product safety rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except where otherwise specified by a children's product safety  rule, component part testing pursuant to 16 CFR part 1109 may be used to  support the certification testing requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a product sample fails certification testing to the  applicable children's product safety rule(s), even if other samples have  passed the same certification test, the manufacturer must investigate  the reasons for the failure and take the necessary steps to address the  reasons for the failure. A manufacturer cannot certify the children's  product until the manufacturer establishes, with a high degree of  assurance that the finished product does comply with all applicable  children's product safety rules.</p>
