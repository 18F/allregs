                            <p class="depth0">On receipt of a special tax stamp, the taxpayer must examine it to ensure that the name and address are correctly stated; if not, the taxpayer must return the stamp to the TTB officer who issued it, with a statement showing the nature of the error and the correct name or address. The appropriate TTB officer, on receipt of such stamp and statement, will compare the data on the stamp with that of the Form 5630.5t in TTB files, correct the error if made in the TTB office, and return the stamp to the taxpayer. However, if the error was in the taxpayer's preparation of the Form 5630.5t, the appropriate TTB officer will require the taxpayer to file a new Form 5630.5t, designated ``Amended Return,'' setting forth the taxpayer's correct name and address, and a statement explaining the error on the original Form 5630.5t. On receipt of the amended Form 5630.5t and a satisfactory explanation of the error, the appropriate TTB officer will make the proper correction on the stamp and return it to the taxpayer.</p>
