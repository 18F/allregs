Such  locomotives may include emission control information labels for the  country to which they are being exported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Locomotives covered by export-only certificates. Locomotives may  be certified for export under 40 CFR 1068.230. Such locomotives may be  introduced into U.S. commerce prior to being exported, but may not be  used in any revenue generating service in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Locomotives included in a certified engine family. Except as  specified in paragraph (d) of this section, locomotives included in a  certified engine   family may be exported without restriction. Note that Sec.  1033.705  requires that exported locomotives be excluded from emission credit  calculations in certain circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> apply for locomotive configurations  included in engine families certified to one or more FELs above any  otherwise applicable standard. Individual locomotives that will be  exported may be excluded from an engine family if they are unlabeled.  For locomotives that were labeled during production, you may remove the  emission control information labels prior to export. All unlabeled  locomotives that will be exported are subject to the provisions of  paragraph (a) of this section. Locomotives that are of a configuration  included in an engine family certified to one of more FELs above any  otherwise applicable standard that include an EPA emission control  information label when exported are considered to be part of the engine  family and must be included in credit calculations under Sec.  1033.705.  Note that this requirement does not apply for locomotives that do not  have an EPA emission control information label, even if they have other  labels (such as an export-only label).
