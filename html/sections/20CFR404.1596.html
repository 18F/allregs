                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Under some circumstances, we may stop your benefits  before we make a determination. Generally, we do this when the  information we have clearly shows you are not now disabled but we cannot  determine when your disability ended. These situations are described in  paragraph (b)(1) and other reasons are given in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section. We refer to this as a suspension of benefits. Your benefits, as  well as those of your dependents (regardless of where they receive their  benefits), may be suspended. When we do this we will give you advance  notice. (See Sec. 404.1595.) We will contact your spouse and children if  they are receiving benefits on your Social Security number, and the  benefits are being mailed to an address different from your own.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When we will suspend your benefits--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You are not now  disabled. We will suspend your benefits if the information we have  clearly shows that you are not disabled and we will be unable to  complete a determination soon enough to prevent us from paying you more  monthly benefits than you are entitled to. This may occur when--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> New medical or other information clearly shows that you are able  to do substantial gainful activity and your benefits should have stopped  more than 2 months ago;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You completed a 9-month period of trial work more than 2 months  ago and you are still working;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At the time you filed for benefits your condition was expected  to improve and you were expected to be able to return to work. You  subsequently did return to work more than 2 months ago with no  significant medical restrictions; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You are not entitled to a trial work period and you are  working.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other reasons. We will also suspend your benefits if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You have failed to respond to our request for additional medical  or other evidence and we are satisfied that you received our request and  our records show that you should be able to respond; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> We are unable to locate you and your checks have been returned  by the Post Office as undeliverable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When we will not suspend your cash benefits. We will not suspend  your cash benefits if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You have become disabled by another impairment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Even though your impairment is no longer disabling,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You are participating in an appropriate program of vocational  rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services,  as described in Sec. 404.327(a) and (b);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You began participating in the program before the date your  disability ended; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> We have determined under Sec. 404.328 that your completion of  the program, or your continuation in the program for a specified period  of time, will increase the likelihood that you will not have to return  to the disability benefit rolls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When the suspension is effective. We will suspend your benefits  effective with the month in which it is determined in accordance with  paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section that your disability benefits should  stop due to your failure, without good cause (see Sec. 404.911), to  comply with our request for necessary information for your continuing  disability review. This review is to determine whether or not you  continue to meet the disability requirements of the law. When we have  received the information, we will reinstate your benefits for any  previous month for which they are otherwise payable, and continue with  the CDR process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When we will terminate your benefits. We will terminate your  benefits following 12 consecutive months of benefit suspension because  you did not comply with our request for information in accordance with  paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. We will count the 12-month  suspension period from   the start of the first month that you stopped receiving benefits (see  paragraph (d) of this section). This termination is effective with the  start of the 13th month after the suspension began because you failed to  cooperate.
