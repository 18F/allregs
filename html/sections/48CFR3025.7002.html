Sec. 3025.7002-2  Exceptions.</p><p class="depth0">Acquisitions in the following categories are not subject to the restrictions in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002-1:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Acquisitions at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acquisition of items not directly related to national security interests of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Acquisitions of any of the items otherwise covered by (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002-1, if the Chief Procurement Officer determines that the item grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States cannot be acquired as and when needed in a satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity at United States market prices. When this exception is used--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Only the DHS Chief Procurement Officer is authorized to make the domestic nonavailability determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The DHS Component, not later than 7 days after the award of the contract, must post a notification that the exception has been applied on the Government-wide point of entry, which may be combined with any synopsis of award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The supporting documentation for the CPO determination prepared by the DHS Component(s) shall include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An analysis of alternatives that would not require a domestic nonavailability determination; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A written justification by the requiring activity, with specificity, why such alternatives are unacceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Acquisitions of items listed in FAR 48 CFR 25.104.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Emergency acquisitions by activities located outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Acquisitions by vessels in foreign waters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Acquisitions of incidental amounts of cotton, other natural fibers, wool or other item covered by

Acquisitions of products that are eligible products per (FAR) 48 CFR Subpart 25.4 are not covered by these restrictions; see (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7003-2 for specific application of trade agreements.


Sec. 3025.7002-3  Specific application of trade agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For covered items entitled to non-discriminatory treatment under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO GPA), or any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) listed in (FAR) 48 CFR Subpart 25.4, this subpart is applied as follows--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For solicitations, orders, exercising of an option and contracts issued by any component other than Transportation Security Administration (TSA), in which any covered items will be procured with a value that is both above the simplified acquisition threshold, and below the applicable trade agreement threshold in (FAR) 48 CFR 25.402, apply (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002-1. Section 3025.7002-2(h) will exclude eligible products of designated countries with FTA thresholds beneath the simplified acquisition threshold from coverage of section 604.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For solicitations, orders, exercising of an option and contracts issued by any component other than Transportation Security Administration (TSA), in which any covered items will be procured with a value exceeding $194,000 (or the superseding threshold upon updating of (FAR) 48 CFR 25.402), (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002-1 does not apply if the items are eligible products per FAR 48 CFR Subpart 25.4; follow (FAR) 48 CFR part 25 instead.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For solicitations, orders, exercising of an option and contracts issued by TSA in which any covered items will be procured with a value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002 applies to all covered items except those from Mexico, Canada or Chile because TSA is listed as a covered governmental entity in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement but TSA is excluded from all other trade agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For covered items from a country that is not entitled to non-discriminatory treatment under the WTO GPA, or any FTA listed in (FAR) 48 CFR subpart 25.4, apply the restrictions of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3025.7002 to all solicitations, orders, exercising of an option and contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold in place of the Buy America Act policies at (FAR) 48 CFR Subpart 25.1.</p>
