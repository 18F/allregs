The inventory year shall be selected consistent with the  baseline year for the RFP plan as required by Sec. 51.1110(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each nonattainment area, the state shall submit a periodic  emission inventory of emissions sources in the area to meet the  requirement in CAA section 182(a)(3)(A). With the exception of the  inventory year and timing of submittal, this inventory shall be  consistent with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Each  periodic inventory shall be submitted no later than the end of each 3- year period after the required submission of the base year inventory for  the nonattainment area. This requirement shall apply until the area is  redesignated to attainment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The emissions values included in the inventories required by  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be actual ozone season day  emissions as defined by Sec. 51.1100(cc).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The state shall report emissions from point sources according to  the point source emissions thresholds of the Air Emissions Reporting  Requirements (AERR), 40 CFR part 51, subpart A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The data elements in the emissions inventory shall be consistent  with the detail required by 40 CFR part 51, subpart A. Since only  emissions within the boundaries of the nonattainment area shall be  included as defined by Sec. 51.1100(cc), this requirement shall apply  to the emissions inventories required in this section instead of any  total county requirements contained in 40 CFR part 51, subpart A.
