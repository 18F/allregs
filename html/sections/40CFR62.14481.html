(An earlier deadline may  apply if your HMIWI is also subject to title V permitting requirements  because of some other triggering requirement.) A ``complete'' title V  permit application is one that has been approved by the appropriate  permitting authority as complete under Section 503 of the Clean Air Act  and 40 CFR parts 70 and 71. It is not enough to have submitted a title V  permit application by September 15, 2000 because the application must be  determined or deemed complete by the permitting authority by that date  for your HMIWI to operate after that date in compliance with Federal  law.</p><p class="depth0">Definitions</p>
