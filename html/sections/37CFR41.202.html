                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicant. An applicant, including a reissue applicant, may  suggest an interference with another application or a patent. The  suggestion must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Provide sufficient information to identify the application or  patent with which the applicant seeks an interference,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify all claims the applicant believes interfere, propose  one or more counts, and show how the claims correspond to one or more  counts,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For each count, provide a claim chart comparing at least one  claim of each party corresponding to the count and show why the claims  interfere within the meaning of Sec.  41.203(a),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Explain in detail why the applicant will prevail on priority,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If a claim has been added or amended to provoke an interference,  provide a claim chart showing the written description for each claim in  the applicant's specification, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For each constructive reduction to practice for which the  applicant wishes to be accorded benefit, provide a chart showing where  the disclosure provides a constructive reduction to practice within the  scope of the interfering subject matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Patentee. A patentee cannot suggest an interference under this  section but may, to the extent permitted under Sec.  1.291 of this  title, alert the examiner of an application claiming interfering subject  matter to the possibility of an interference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examiner. An examiner may require an applicant to add a claim to  provoke an interference. Failure to satisfy the requirement within a  period (not less than one month) the examiner sets will operate as a  concession of priority for the subject matter of the claim. If the  interference would be with a patent, the applicant must also comply with  paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6) of this section. The claim the examiner  proposes to have added must, apart from the question of priority under  35 U.S.C. 102(g):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Be patentable to the applicant, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Be drawn to patentable subject matter claimed by another  applicant or patentee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Requirement to show priority under 35 U.S.C. 102(g). (1) When an  applicant has an earliest constructive reduction to practice that is  later than the apparent earliest constructive reduction to practice for  a patent or published application claiming interfering subject matter,  the applicant must show why it would prevail on priority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If an applicant fails to show priority under paragraph (d)(1) of  this section, an administrative patent judge may nevertheless declare an  interference to place the applicant under an order to show cause why  judgment should not be entered against the applicant on priority. New  evidence in support of priority will not be admitted except on a showing  of good cause. The Board may authorize the filing of motions to redefine  the interfering subject matter or to change the benefit accorded to the  parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Sufficiency of showing. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A showing of priority under this  section is not sufficient unless it would, if unrebutted, support a  determination of priority in favor of the party making the showing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When testimony or production necessary to show priority is not  available without authorization under   Sec.  41.150(c) or Sec.  41.156(a), the showing shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any necessary interrogatory, request for admission, request for  production, or deposition request, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A detailed proffer of what the response to the interrogatory or  request would be expected to be and an explanation of the relevance of  the response to the question of priority.
