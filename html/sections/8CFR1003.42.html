                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Referral. Jurisdiction for an Immigration Judge to review an adverse credible fear finding by an asylum officer pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(B) of the Act shall commence with the filing by the Service of Form I-863, Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge. The Service shall also file with the notice of referral a copy of the written record of determination as defined in section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II) of the Act, including a copy of the alien's written request for review, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Record of proceeding. The Immigration Court shall create a Record of Proceeding for a review of an adverse credible fear determination. This record shall not be merged with any later proceeding pursuant to section 240 of the Act involving the same alien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Procedures and evidence. The Immigration Judge may receive into evidence any oral or written statement which is material and relevant to any issue in the review. The testimony of the alien shall be under oath or affirmation administered by the Immigration Judge. If an interpreter is necessary, one will be provided by the Immigration Court. The Immigration Judge shall determine whether the review shall be in person, or through telephonic or video connection (where available). The alien may consult with a person or persons of the alien's choosing prior to the review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Standard of review. The immigration judge shall make a de novo determination as to whether there is a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of the alien's claim and such other facts as are known to the immigration judge, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum under section 208 of the Act or withholding under section 241(b)(3) of the Act or withholding under the Convention Against Torture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Timing. The Immigration Judge shall conclude the review to the maximum extent practicable within 24 hours, but in no case later than 7 days after the date the supervisory asylum officer has approved the asylum officer's negative credible fear determination issued on Form I-869, Record of

Negative Credible Fear Finding and Request for Review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Decision. If an immigration judge determines that an alien has a credible fear of persecution or torture, the immigration judge shall vacate the order entered pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I) of the Act. Subsequent to the order being vacated, the Service shall issue and file Form I-862, Notice to Appear, with the Immigration Court to commence removal proceedings. The alien shall have the opportunity to apply for asylum and withholding of removal in the course of removal proceedings pursuant to section 240 of the Act. If an immigration judge determines that an alien does not have a credible fear of persecution or torture, the immigration judge shall affirm the asylum officer's determination and remand the case to the Service for execution of the removal order entered pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I) of the Act. No appeal shall lie from a review of an adverse credible fear determination made by an immigration judge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Custody. An Immigration Judge shall have no authority to review an alien's custody status in the course of a review of an adverse credible fear determination made by the Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Safe third country agreement--(1) Arriving alien. An immigration judge has no jurisdiction to review a determination by an asylum officer that an arriving alien is not eligible to apply for asylum pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement (the Agreement) under section 208(a)(2)(A) of the Act and should be returned to a safe third country to pursue his or her claims for asylum or other protection under the laws of that country. See 8 CFR 208.30(e)(6). However, in any case where an asylum officer has found that an arriving alien qualifies for an exception to the Agreement, an immigration judge does have jurisdiction to review a negative credible fear finding made thereafter by the asylum officer as provided in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Aliens in transit. An immigration judge has no jurisdiction to review any determination by DHS that an alien being removed from Canada in transit through the United States should be returned to Canada to pursue asylum claims under Canadian law, under the terms of a safe third country agreement with Canada.
