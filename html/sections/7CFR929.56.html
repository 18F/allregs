                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>. Each request  shall state the quantity of cranberries for which release is requested  and shall provide such additional information as the committee may  require. Handlers may replace the quantity of withheld cranberries  requested for release as provided under either paragraph (b) or (c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The handler may contract with another handler for an amount of  free cranberries to be converted to restricted cranberries that is equal  to the volume of cranberries that the handler wishes to have converted  from his own restricted cranberries to free cranberries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The handlers involved in such an agreement shall provide the  committee with such information as may be requested prior to the release  of any restricted cranberries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The committee shall establish guidelines to ensure that all  necessary documentation is provided to the committee, including but not  limited to, the amount of cranberries being converted and the identities  of the handlers assuming the responsibility for withholding and  disposing of the free cranberries being converted to restricted  cranberries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cranberries converted to replace released cranberries may be  required to be inspected and meet such standards as may be prescribed  for withheld cranberries prior to disposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transactions and agreements negotiated between handlers shall  include all costs associated with such transactions including the  purchase of the free cranberries to be converted to restricted  cranberries and all costs associated with inspection (if applicable) and  disposal of such restricted cranberries. No costs shall be incurred by  the committee other than for the normal activities associated with the  implementation and operation of a volume regulation program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Free cranberries belonging to one handler and converted to  restricted cranberries on the behalf of another handler shall be  reported to the committee in such manner as prescribed by the committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as otherwise directed by the Secretary, as near as  practicable to the beginning of the marketing season of each fiscal  period with respect to which the marketing policy proposes regulation  pursuant to Sec. 929.52(a), the committee shall determine the amount  per barrel each handler shall deposit with the committee for it to  release to him, in accordance with this section, all or part of the  cranberries he is withholding; and the committee shall give notice of  such amount of deposit to handlers. Such notice shall state the period  during which such amount of deposit shall be in effect. Whenever the  committee determines that, by reason of changed conditions or other  factors, a different amount should therefore be deposited for the  release of withheld cranberries, it shall give notice to handlers of the  new amount and the effective period thereof. Each determination as to  the amount of deposit shall be on the basis of the committee's  evaluation of the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The prices at which growers are selling cranberries to handlers,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The prices at which handlers are selling fresh market  cranberries to dealers,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The prices at which cranberries are being sold for processing in  products,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The prices at which handlers are selling cranberry concentrate,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The prices the committee has paid to purchase cranberries to  replace released cranberries in accordance with this section, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The costs incurred by growers in producing cranberries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Each request for release of withheld cranberries shall include,  in addition to all other information as may be prescribed by the  committee, the quantity of cranberries the release is requested and  shall be accompanied by a deposit (a cashier's or certified check made  payable to the Cranberry Marketing Committee) in an amount equal to the  twenty percent of the amount determined by multiplying the number of  barrels stated in the request by the then effective amount per barrel as  determined in paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Subsequent deposits equal to, but not less than, the ten percent  of the remaining outstanding balance shall be payable to the committee  on a monthly basis commencing on January 1, and concluding by no later  than August 31 of the fiscal period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> If the committee determines such a release request is properly  filled out, is accompanied by the required deposit, and contains a  certification that the handler is withholding such cranberries, it shall  release to such handler the quantity of cranberries specified in his  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Funds deposited for the release of withheld cranberries,  pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, shall be used by the  committee to purchase from handlers unrestricted (free percentage)  cranberries in an aggregate amount as nearly equal to, but not in excess  of, the total quantity of the released cranberries as it is possible to  purchase to replace the released cranberries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All handlers shall be given an equal opportunity to participate  in such purchase of unrestricted (free percentage) cranberries. If a  larger quantity is offered than can be purchased, the purchases shall be  made at the lowest price possible. If two or more handlers offer  unrestricted (free percentage) cranberries at the same price, purchases  from such handlers shall be in proportion to the quantity of their  respective offerings insofar as such division is practicable. The  committee shall dispose of cranberries purchased as restricted  cranberries in accordance with Sec. 929.57. Any funds received by the  committee for cranberries so disposed of, which are in excess of the  costs incurred by the committee in making such disposition, will accrue  to the committee's general fund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In the event any portion of the funds deposited with the  committee pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section cannot, for reasons  beyond the committee's control, be expended to purchase unrestricted  (free percentage) cranberries to replace those withheld cranberries  requested to be released, such unexpended funds shall, after deducting  expenses incurred by the committee, be refunded to the handler who  deposited the funds. The handler shall equitably distribute such refund  among the growers delivering to such handler.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Inspection for restricted (withheld) cranberries released to a  handler is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary,  rules and regulations for the implementation of this section. Such rules  and regulations may include, but are not limited to, revisions in the  payment schedule specified in paragraphs (c)(7) and (c)(8) of this  section.  [70 FR 7643, Feb. 15, 2005]</p>
