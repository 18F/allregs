                            <p class="depth0">For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Aseptic processing and packaging means the filling of a  commercially sterilized cooled product into pre sterilized containers,  followed by aseptic hermetical sealing, with a presterilized closure, in  an atmosphere free of microorganisms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Bleeders means openings used to remove air that enters with  steam from retorts and steam chambers and to promote circulation of  steam in such retorts and steam chambers. Bleeders may serve as a means  of removing condensate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Come-up-time means the time which elapses between the  introduction of steam into the closed retort and the time when the  retort reaches the required processing temperature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Commercial processor includes any person engaged in commercial,  custom, or institutional (church, school, penal, or other organization)  processing of food, including pet food. Persons engaged in the  production of foods that are to be used in market or consumer tests are  also included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Commercial sterility: (1) ``Commercial sterility'' of thermally  processed food means the condition achieved--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By the application of heat which renders the food free of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Microorganisms capable of reproducing in the food under normal  nonrefrigerated conditions of storage and distribution; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Viable microorganisms (including spores) of public health  significance; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By the control of water activity and the application of heat,  which renders the food free of microorga nisms capable of reproducing in  the food under normal nonrefrigerated conditions of storage and  distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ``Commercial sterility'' of equipment and containers used for  aseptic processing and packaging of food means the condition achieved by  application of heat, chemical sterilant(s), or other appropriate  treatment that renders the equipment and containers free of viable  microorganisms having public health significance, as well as  microorganisms of nonhealth significance,   capable of reproducing in the food under normal nonrefrigerated  conditions of storage and distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Critical factor means any property, characteristic, condition,  aspect, or other parameter, variation of which may affect the scheduled  process and the attainment of commercial sterility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Flame sterilizer means an apparatus in which hermetically sealed  containers are agitated at atmospheric pressure, by either continuous,  discontinuous, or reciprocating movement, with impinging gas flames to  achieve sterilization temperatures. A holding period in a heated section  may follow the initial heating period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Headspace, gross is the vertical distance between the level of  the product (generally the liquid surface) in an upright rigid container  and the top edge of the container (the top of the double seam of a can  or the top edge of a glass jar).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Headspace, net of a container is the vertical distance between  the level of the product (generally the liquid surface) in the upright  rigid container and the inside surface of the lid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Hermetically sealed container means a container that is designed  and intended to be secure against the entry of microorganisms and  thereby to maintain the commercial sterility of its contents after  processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Incubation means the holding of a sample(s) at a specified  temperature for a specified period of time for the purpose of permitting  or stimulating the growth of microorganisms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Initial temperature means the average temperature of the  contents of the coldest container to be processed at the time the  thermal processing cycle begins, as determined after thorough stirring  or shaking of the filled and sealed container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Lot means that amount of a product produced during a period of  time indicated by a specific code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Low-acid foods means any foods, other than alcoholic beverages,  with a finished equilibrium pH greater than 4.6 and a water activity  (aw) greater than 0.85. Tomatoes and tomato products having a  finished equilibrium pH less than 4.7 are not classed as low-acid foods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Minimum thermal process means the application of heat to food,  either before or after sealing in a hermetically sealed container, for a  period of time and at a temperature scientifically determined to be  adequate to ensure destruction of microorganisms of public health  significance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Operating process means the process selected by the processor  that equals or exceeds the minimum requirements set forth in the  scheduled process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Retort means any closed vessel or other equipment used for the  thermal processing of foods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> Scheduled process means the process selected by the processor as  adequate under the conditions of manufacture for a given product to  achieve commercial sterility. This process may be in excess of that  necessary to ensure destruction of microorganisms of public health  significance, and shall be at least equivalent to the process  established by a competent processing authority to achieve commercial  sterility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(s)</em> Shall is used to state mandatory requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(t)</em> Should is used to state recommended or advisory procedures or to  identify recommended equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(u)</em> Vacuum-packed products means those products that are sealed in a  container under the vacuum specified in the scheduled process, the  maintenance of which vacuum is critical to the adequacy of the scheduled  process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Vents means openings through the retort shell, controlled by  gate, plug cock, or other adequate valves used for the elimination of  air during the venting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(w)</em> Water activity (aw) is a measure of the free moisture  in a product and is the quotient of the water vapor pressure of the  substance divided by the vapor pressure of pure water at the same  temperature.</p>
