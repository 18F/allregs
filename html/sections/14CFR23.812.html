                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When certification to the emergency exit provisions of Sec.  23.807(d)(4) is requested, the following apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An emergency lighting system, independent of the main cabin  lighting system, must be installed. However, the source of general cabin  illumination may be common to both the emergency and main lighting  systems if the power supply to the emergency lighting system is  independent of the power supply to the main lighting system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> There must be a crew warning light that illuminates in the  cockpit when power is on in the airplane and the emergency lighting  control device is not armed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The emergency lights must be operable manually from the  flightcrew station and be provided with automatic activation. The  cockpit control device must have ``on,'' ``off,'' and ``armed''  positions so that, when armed in the cockpit, the lights will operate by  automatic activation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> There must be a means to safeguard against inadvertent operation  of the cockpit control device from the ``armed'' or ``on'' positions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The cockpit control device must have provisions to allow the  emergency lighting system to be armed or activated at any time that it  may be needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When armed, the emergency lighting system must activate and  remain lighted when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The normal electrical power of the airplane is lost; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The airplane is subjected to an impact that results in a  deceleration in excess of 2g and a velocity change in excess of 3.5  feet-per-second, acting along the longitudinal axis of the airplane; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any other emergency condition exists where automatic activation  of the emergency lighting is necessary to aid with occupant evacuation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The emergency lighting system must be capable of being turned  off and reset by the flightcrew after automatic activation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The emergency lighting system must provide internal lighting,  including--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Illuminated emergency exit marking and locating signs, including  those required in Sec. 23.811(b);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sources of general illumination in the cabin that provide an  average illumination of not less than 0.05 foot-candle and an  illumination at any point of not less than 0.01 foot-candle when  measured along the center line of the main passenger aisle(s) and at the  seat armrest height; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Floor proximity emergency escape path marking that provides  emergency evacuation guidance for the airplane occupants when all  sources of illumination more than 4 feet above the cabin aisle floor are  totally obscured.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The energy supply to each emergency lighting unit must provide  the required level of illumination for at least 10 minutes at the  critical ambient conditions after activation of the emergency lighting  system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If rechargeable batteries are used as the energy supply for the  emergency lighting system, they may be recharged from the main  electrical power system of the airplane provided the charging circuit is  designed to preclude inadvertent battery discharge into the charging  circuit faults. If the emergency lighting system does not include a  charging circuit, battery condition monitors are required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Components of the emergency lighting system, including  batteries, wiring, relays, lamps, and switches, must be capable of  normal operation after being subjected to the inertia forces resulting  from the ultimate load factors prescribed in Sec. 23.561(b)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The emergency lighting system must be designed so that after any  single transverse vertical separation of the fuselage during a crash  landing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least 75 percent of all electrically illuminated emergency  lights required by this section remain operative; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each electrically illuminated exit sign required by Sec. 23.811  (b) and (c) remains operative, except those that are directly damaged by  the fuselage separation.
