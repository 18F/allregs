Any showings or demonstrations  required to be made under this part to the issuing agency, when not EPA,  are subject to independent determinations by EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Malfunction means any unanticipated and unavoidable failure of  air pollution control equipment or process equipment or of a process to  operate in a normal or usual manner. Failures that are caused entirely  or in part by poor design, poor maintenance, careless operation, or any  other preventable upset condition or preventable equipment breakdown  shall not be considered malfunctions. A malfunction exists only for the  minimum time necessary to implement corrective measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Maximum production capacity means either the maximum  demonstrated rate at which a smelter has produced its principal metallic  final product under the process equipment configuration and operating  procedures prevailing on or before August 7, 1977, or a rate which the  smelter is able to demonstrate by calculation is attainable with process  equipment existing on August 7, 1977. The rate may be expressed as a  concentrate feed rate to the smelter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> NAAQS and National Ambient Air Quality Standards, unless  otherwise specified, refer only to the National Primary and Secondary  Ambient Air Quality Standards for sulfur dioxide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Scheduled maintenance means any periodic procedure, necessary to  maintain the integrity or reliability of emissions control performance,  which can be anticipated and scheduled in advance. In sulfuric acid  plants, it includes among other items the screening or replacement of  catalyst, the re-tubing of heat exchangers, and the routine repair and  cleaning of gas handling/cleaning equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Smelter owner and operator means the owner or operator of the  smelter, without distinction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Supplementary control system (SCS) means any technique for  limiting the concentration of a pollutant in the ambient air by varying  the emissions of that pollutant according to atmospheric conditions. For  the purposes of this part, the term supplementary control system does  not include any dispersion technique based solely on the use of a stack  the height of which exceeds good engineering practice (as determined  under regulations implementing section 123 of the Act).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(v)</em> Unauthorized dispersion technique refers to any dispersion  technique which, under section 123 of the Act and the regulations  promulgated pursuant to that section, may not be used to reduce the  degree of emission limitation otherwise required in the applicable SIP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(w)</em> Unless otherwise specified in this part, all terms shall have  the same meaning given them by the Act.
