The new source performance standards for point sources with less than 1,000 annual non-propeller aircraft departures are beyond the scope of this part and shall be determined by the permit authority on a site-specific basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Aircraft deicing. Except for new airports located in Alaska, all new sources located in an area that, at the time of construction, had more than 3,000 annual heating degree days, and are estimated, within five years of

commencing operations, to exceed 10,000 annual departures, must comply with the following requirements upon the date the facility exceeds 10,000 annual departures. New source performance standards that apply prior to that date, new source performance standards for sources that project they will not exceed 10,000 annual departures within five years of commencing operations, and new performance standards for airports in Alaska, are beyond the scope of this regulation and shall be determined by the permit authority on a site-specific basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Collection requirement. The new source must collect at least 60 percent of available ADF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Numerical effluent limitation. The new source must achieve the performance standards in Table II for available ADF collected pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The limitation must be met at the location where the effluent leaves the onsite treatment system utilized for meeting these requirements and before commingling with any non-deicing discharge.</p><p class="depth3">Table II--NSPS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Wastestream                     Pollutant                Daily maximum            Weekly average----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Aircraft Deicing.................
