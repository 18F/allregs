                                Sec. 680.11  Staff involvement with NSF proposals and awards.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Many scientists, engineers, and educators interrupt active  research and teaching careers to spend a year or two at NSF and then  return to research and teaching, usually at the same institution from  which they came. Many such visiting scientists, engineers, and educators  (and a few permanent employees) who have been principal investigators  under NSF awards before coming to NSF, retain some interest or  association with the work. If an individual is a principal investigator  under an NSF award, the individual is not precluded from retaining ties  to the work after becoming an NSF employee. The employee may stay in  contact with those who are continuing the work in the employee's  laboratory or on his or her project. The employee may continue to  supervise graduate students. And the employee may visit and work in the  laboratory on his or her own time for these and related purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before a prospective employee comes to NSF, the prospective  employee and the grantee institution must designate, subject to NSF  approval, a ``substitute principal investigator''--i.e., another  scientist who will be responsible for the work and equipment and will  represent the institution in any dealings with NSF officials while the  prospective employee is at NSF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Appointment of a substitute principal investigator is  unnecessary if all work under an award is to be completely suspended  while the employee is at NSF. If the work is to be suspended, the  employee and the grantee institution must inform the NSF in writing  before the employee's employment begins. Work under the award may be  resumed when the employee completes his or her NSF employment, and its  term may be extended to account for the time lost during the employee's  NSF employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NSF will entertain no proposal on which a current NSF  employee would be a senior investigator or equivalent, unless it is a  proposal for continuation or extension of support for work on which the  employee served in that capacity before coming to NSF. Any proposal for  continuation of NSF support at essentially the same level (with  reasonable allowance for inflation) will normally be considered a  proposal for continuation or extension if it would support the work of  the same investigator and his or her laboratory or group (if any) in the  same general field of science, engineering, or education,  notwithstanding that the focus of the work may change in response to  research opportunities or educational needs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Someone other than the current NSF employee must submit any such  proposal for continuation or extension of work NSF previously supported  and handle all negotiations with NSF, but the capacity in which the  current NSF employee will serve should be clearly spelled out in the  proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In accordance with 5 CFR 5301.103(a)(1), an NSF employee may not  receive, directly or indirectly, any salary, consulting fee, honorarium,  or other form of compensation for services, or reimbursement of  expenses, from an NSF award.</p>
