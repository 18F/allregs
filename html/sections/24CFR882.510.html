                                Sec. 882.510  Adjustment of utility allowance.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The PHA must determine, at least annually, whether an adjustment is  required in the Utility Allowance applicable to the dwelling units in  the Program, on grounds of changes in utility rates or other change of  general applicability to all units in the Program. The PHA may also  establish a separate schedule of allowances for each building of 20 or  more assisted units, based upon at least one year's actual utility   consumption data following rehabilitation under the Program. If the PHA  determines that an adjustment should be made in its Schedule of  Allowances or if it establishes a separate schedule for a building which  will change the allowance, the PHA must then determine the amounts of  adjustments to be made in the amount of rent to be paid by affected  Families and the amount of housing assistance payments and must notify  the Owners and Families accordingly. Any adjustment to the Allowance  must be implemented no later than at the Family's next reexamination or  at lease renewal, whichever is earlier.
