                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Stannous chloride is anhydrous or contains two molecules of water of hydration. Anhydrous stannous chloride (SnCl2, CAS Reg. No. 7772-99-8) is the chloride salt of metallic tin. It is prepared by reacting molten tin with either chlorine or gaseous tin tetrachloride. Dihydrated stannous chloride (SnCl2.2H2O, CAS Reg. No. 10025-69-1) is the chloride salt of metallic tin that contains two molecules of water. It is prepared from granulated tin suspended in water and hydrochloric acid or chlorine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Both forms of the ingredient meet the specifications of the Food Chemicals Codex, 3d Ed.
