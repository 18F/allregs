                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conflict of interest means a situation in which  a PAE or other restricted person:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has a financial interest, direct or indirect, that prevents or  may prevent the PAE or other restricted person from acting at all times  in the best interests of HUD;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has one or more personal, business, or financial interests or  relationships that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the  relevant facts to question the integrity or impartiality of those who  are or will be acting under the PRA; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is taking an adverse position to HUD or to an owner whose  project is covered by a PRA in a lawsuit, administrative proceeding, or  other contested matter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Control means the power to vote, directly or indirectly, 25  percent or more of any class of the voting stock of a company; the  ability to direct in any manner the election of a majority of a company  (or other entity's) directors or trustees; or the ability to exercise a  controlling influence over the company or entity's management and  policies. For purposes of this definition, a general partner of a  limited partnership is presumed to be in control of that partnership.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Restricted person means a PAE; any management official of the  PAE; any legal entity that is under the control of the PAE, is in  control of the PAE, or is under common control with the PAE; or any  employee, agent or contractor of the PAE, or employee of such agent or  contractor, who will perform or has performed services under a PRA with  HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General prohibitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The PAE may not permit conflicts of  interest to exist without obtaining a waiver in accordance with this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The PAE must establish procedures to identify conflicts of  interest and to ensure that conflicts of interest do not arise or  continue, subject to waiver under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> HUD will not enter into PRAs with potential PAEs who have  conflicts of interest associated with a particular project, or permit  PAEs to continue performance under existing PRAs when such PAEs have  conflicts of interest, unless such conflicts have been eliminated to  HUD's satisfaction by the PAE or potential PAE or are waived by HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The PAE has a continuing obligation to take all action necessary  to   identify whether it or any other restricted person has a conflict of  interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waivers. HUD will waive conflicts of interest only when, in  light of all relevant circumstances, the interests of HUD in the PAE's  or another restricted persons's participation outweigh the concern that  a reasonable person may question the integrity of HUD's operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conflicts of interest arising prior to PAE selection--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Request for review of conflicts of interest. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A potential PAE, with  its request to HUD for consideration for selection as a PAE, must  identify existing conflicts of interest and may make a written request  for a determination as to the existence of a conflict of interest, may  request that the conflict of interest, if any, be waived, or may propose  how it could eliminate the conflict.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If, after submitting a request but prior to selection, a  potential PAE discovers that it has a conflict, it must notify HUD in  writing within 10 days of submitting the request or prior to selection,  whichever is earlier. Such notification must contain a detailed  description of the conflict. The potential PAE may, with its  notification, request that the conflict be waived or may propose how it  may eliminate the conflict. The potential PAE may also request a  determination as to the existence of the conflict. The potential PAE may  also request a determination as to the existence of the conflict.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Review by HUD. Subject to the restrictions set forth in this  section, HUD in its sole discretion may determine whether a conflict of  interest exists, may waive the conflict of interest, or may approve in  writing a PAE's proposal to eliminate a conflict of interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conflicts of interest that arise or are discovered after PAE  selection. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A PAE must notify HUD in writing within 10 days after  discovering that it or another restricted person has a conflict of  interest. Such notification must contain a detailed description of the  conflict of interest and state how the PAE intends to eliminate the  conflict. The PAE may also request a determination as to the existence  of a conflict.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HUD will, after receipt of such notification or other discovery  of the PAE's conflict or potential conflict of interest, take such  action as it determines is in its best interests, which may involve  proceeding under Sec. 401.313 or as provided in the following sentences.  HUD may notify the PAE in writing of its findings as to whether a  conflict of interest exists and the basis for such determination,  whether or not a waiver will be granted, or whether corrective actions  may be taken in order to eliminate the conflict of interest. Corrective  action must be completed by the PAE not later than 30 days after  notification is mailed by HUD unless HUD, at its sole discretion,  determines that it is in its best interests to grant the PAE an  extension in which to complete the corrective action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reconsideration of decisions. Decisions issued pursuant to this  section may be reconsidered by HUD upon application by the PAE. Such  requests must be in writing and must contain the basis for the request.  HUD may, at its discretion and after determining that it is in its best  interests, stay any corrective or other actions previously ordered  pending reconsideration of a decision.
