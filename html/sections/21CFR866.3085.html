                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. Brucella spp. serological reagents are devices  that consist of antigens and antisera used for serological  identification of Brucella spp. from cultured isolates derived from  clinical specimens or to identify antibodies to Brucella spp. in serum.  Additionally, some of these reagents consist of antisera conjugated with  a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) used to identify Brucella  spp. directly from clinical specimens or cultured isolates derived from  clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of  brucellosis (e.g., undulant fever, Malta fever) caused by bacteria  belonging to the genus Brucella and provides epidemiological information  on diseases caused by these microorganisms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The device is  exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part  807 of this chapter subject to Sec. 866.9.  [47 FR 50823, Nov. 9, 1982, as amended at 63 FR 59226, Nov. 3, 1998]</p>
