                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Section 23 or former section 44C provides a residential energy credit against the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. The credit is an amount equal to the individual's qualified energy conservation expenditures (set out in paragraph (b)) plus the individual's qualified renewable energy source expenditures (set out in paragraph (c)) for the taxable year. However, the credit is subject to the limitations described in

paragraph (d) and the special rules contained in Sec.  1.23-3. The credit is nonrefundable (that is, the credit may not exceed an individual's tax liability for the taxable year). However, any unused credit may be carried over to succeeding years to the extent permitted under paragraph (e). Renters as well as owners of a dwelling unit may qualify for the credit. See Sec.  1.23-3(h) for the rules relating to the allocation of the credit in the case of joint occupants of a dwelling unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualified energy conservation expenditures. In the case of any dwelling unit, the qualified energy conservation expenditures are 15 percent of the energy conservation expenditures made by the taxpayer with respect to the dwelling unit during the taxable year, but not in excess of $2,000 of such expenditures. See Sec.  1.23-2(a) for the definition of energy conservation expenditures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Qualified renewable energy source expenditures. In the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1979, the qualified renewable energy source expenditures are 40 percent of the renewable energy source expenditures made by the taxpayer during the taxable year (and before January 1, 1986) with respect to the dwelling units that do not exceed $10,000. In the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980, the qualified renewable energy source expenditures are the renewable energy source expenditures made by the taxpayer with respect to the dwelling unit during the taxable year, but not in excess of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 30 percent of the expenditures up to $2,000, plus</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 20 percent of the expenditures over $2,000, but not more than $10,000.
See Sec.  1.23-2(b) for the definition of renewable energy source expenditures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitations--(1) Minimum dollar amount. No residential energy credit shall be allowed with respect to any return (whether joint or separate) for any taxable year if the amount of the credit otherwise allowable (determined without regard to the tax liability limitation imposed by paragraph (d)(3) of this section) is less than $10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Minimum dollar amount. No residential energy credit shall be allowed with respect to any return (whether joint or separate) for any taxable year if the amount of the credit otherwise allowable (determined without regard to the tax liability limitation imposed by paragraph (d)(3) of this section) is less than $10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior expenditures taken into account--(i) In general. For purposes of determining the credit for expenditures made during a taxable year, the taxpayer must reduce the maximum amount of allowable expenditures with respect to the dwelling until in computing qualified energy conservation expenditures (under paragraph (b)) or qualified renewable energy conservation expenditures (under paragraph (c)) by prior expenditures which were made by the taxpayer or by joint occupants (see Sec.  1.23-3(h)) with respect to the same dwelling unit, and which were taken into account in computing the credit for prior taxable years. In the case of expenditures made during taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980, the reduction of the maximum amount under paragraph (c) must first be made with respect to the first $2,000 of expenditures (to which a 30 percent rate applies) and then with respect to the next $8,000 of expenditures (to which a 20 percent rate applies). This reduction must be made if all or any part of the credit was allowed in or was carried over from a prior taxable year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of determining the credit for expenditures made during a taxable year, the taxpayer must reduce the maximum amount of allowable expenditures with respect to the dwelling until in computing qualified energy conservation expenditures (under paragraph (b)) or qualified renewable energy conservation expenditures (under paragraph (c)) by prior expenditures which were made by the taxpayer or by joint occupants (see Sec.  1.23-3(h)) with respect to the same dwelling unit, and which were taken into account in computing the credit for prior taxable years. In the case of expenditures made during taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980, the reduction of the maximum amount under paragraph (c) must first be made with respect to the first $2,000 of expenditures (to which a 30 percent rate applies) and then with respect to the next $8,000 of expenditures (to which a 20 percent rate applies). This reduction must be made if all or any part of the credit was allowed in or was carried over from a prior taxable year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Change of principal residence. A taxpayer is eligible for the maximum credit for qualifying expenditures made with respect to a new principal residence notwithstanding the allowance of a credit for qualifying expenditures made with respect to the taxpayer's previous principal residence. Furthermore, except in certain cases involving joint occupancy (see Sec.  1.23-3(h)), a taxpayer is eligible for the maximum credit notwithstanding the allowance of a credit to a prior owner of the taxpayer's new principal residence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The rules with respect to the reduction for prior expenditures are illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth4">Example. In 1978, A has $1,000 of energy conservation expenditures and $5,000 of renewable energy source expenditures in connection with A's principal residence. A's residential energy credit for 1978 is $1,350, made up of $150 of qualified energy conservation expenditures (15 percent of $1,000) plus $1,200 of qualified renewable energy source expenditures (30 percent of the first $2,000 plus 20 percent of the next $3,000). In 1979 A has an additional $2,000 of energy conservation expenditures and $3,000 of renewable energy source expenditures in connection with the same principal residence. A's residential energy credit for 1979 is $750, made up of $150 of qualified energy conservation expenditures (15 percent of the new maximum $1,000,

which was reduced from $2,000 by $1,000 of energy conservation expenditures taken into account in 1978) plus $600 of qualified renewable energy source expenditures (20 percent of $3,000, which reflects the reduction of the maximum allowable expenditures by the $5,000 of renewable energy source expenditures taken into account in 1978). The maximum residential energy credit allowable to A with respect to the same principal residence in subsequent years in which the credit is allowable is $400 (20 percent of the new maximum of $2,000 for renewable energy source expenditures and none for energy conservation expenditures).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effects of grants and subsidized energy financing--(i) In general. Qualified expenditures financed with Federal, State, or local grants shall be taken into account for purposes of computing the residential energy credit only if the amount of such grants is taxable as gross income to the taxpayer under section 61 (relating to the definition of gross income) and the regulations thereunder. In the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980, qualified expenditures made from subsidized energy financing (as defined in Sec.  1.23-2(i)) shall not be taken into account (except as provided in the following sentence) for purposes of computing the residential energy credit. In addition, the taxpayer must reduce the maximum amount allowable expenditures (reduced as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) with respect to the dwelling unit in computing qualified energy conservation expenditures (under paragraph (b) of this section) or qualified renewable energy source expenditures (under paragraph (c) of this section), whichever is appropriate, by an amount equal to the sum of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Qualified expenditures financed with Federal, State, or local grants shall be taken into account for purposes of computing the residential energy credit only if the amount of such grants is taxable as gross income to the taxpayer under section 61 (relating to the definition of gross income) and the regulations thereunder. In the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980, qualified expenditures made from subsidized energy financing (as defined in Sec.  1.23-2(i)) shall not be taken into account (except as provided in the following sentence) for purposes of computing the residential energy credit. In addition, the taxpayer must reduce the maximum amount allowable expenditures (reduced as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) with respect to the dwelling unit in computing qualified energy conservation expenditures (under paragraph (b) of this section) or qualified renewable energy source expenditures (under paragraph (c) of this section), whichever is appropriate, by an amount equal to the sum of--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The amount of expenditures from subsidized energy financing (as defined in Sec.  1.23-2(i)) that were made by the taxpayer during the taxable year or any prior taxable year beginning after December 31, 1980, with respect to the same dwelling unit, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The amount of any funds received by the taxpayer during the taxable year or any prior taxable year beginning after December 31, 1980, as a Federal, State, or local government grant made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980, that were used to make qualified expenditures with respect to the same dwelling unit and that were not included in the gross income of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(3) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth4">Example. A had in 1979 made a renewable energy source expenditure of $2,000 in connection with A's residence for which he took the then allowed credit of $600. In 1981 A made additional renewable energy source expenditures of $9,000 with respect to which he received a loan of $5,000 from the Federal Solar-Energy and Energy Conservation Bank. Assume that the loan is subsidized energy financing. A computes the credit as follows: The initial maximum allowable dollar limit is $10,000 which is reduced by the sum of the prior year expenditures of $2,000 and the subsidized energy financing loan of $5,000 leaving a dollar limit of $3,000 ($10,000-($2,000+$5,000)). The $5,000 portion of the $9,000 funded by the subsidized energy financing loan is not allowed as a renewable energy source expenditure. The remaining expenditures in 1981 are $4,000 ($9,000-$5,000). However, this amount exceeds the allowed maximum dollar limit of $3,000. Therefore, A's creditable expenses for 1981 are only $3,000 on which the credit is $1,200 (40 percent of $3,000).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Tax liability limitation--(i) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1983. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1983, the credit allowed by this section shall not exceed the amount of tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the taxable year, reduced by the sum of credits allowable under--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1983. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1983, the credit allowed by this section shall not exceed the amount of tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the taxable year, reduced by the sum of credits allowable under--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Section 21 (relating to expenses for household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Section 22 (relating to credit for the elderly and the permanently and totally disabled), and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Section 24 (relating to contributions to candidates for public office).
See section 26 (b) and (c) for certain taxes that are not treated as imposed by chapter 1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1984. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1984, the credit allowed by this section shall not exceed the amount of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the taxable year, reduced by the sum of the credits allowable under--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Section 32 (relating to tax withheld at source on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations and on tax-free covenant bonds),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Section 33 (relating to the taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the United States),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Section 37 (relating to retirement income),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Section 38 (relating to investment in certain depreciable property),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Section 40 (relating to expenses of work incentive programs),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Section 41 (relating to contributions to candidates for public office),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Section 42 (relating to the general tax credit),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Section 44 (relating to purchase of new personal residence),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> Section 44A (relating to expenses for household and dependent care services), and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(J)</em> Section 44B (relating to employment of certain new employees).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Carryforward of unused credit. If the credit allowable by this section exceeds the tax liability limitation imposed by section 23(b)(5) (or former section 44C(b)(5)) and paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the excess credit shall be carried forward to the succeeding taxable year and added to the credit allowable under this section for the succeeding taxable year. A carryforward that is not used in the succeeding year because it exceeds the tax liability limitation shall be carried forward to later taxable years until used, except that no excess credit may be carried forward to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1987.
