                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Under section 995 (b)(1), each shareholder of a  DISC shall be treated as having received a distribution taxable as a  dividend with respect to his stock on the last day of each taxable year  of the DISC, in an amount which is equal to his pro rata share of the  sum (as limited by paragraph (b) of this section), of the following  seven items:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An amount equal to the gross interest derived by the DISC during  such year from producer's loans (as defined in Sec. 1.993-4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An amount equal to the lower of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any gain recognized by the DISC during such year on the sale or  exchange of property (other than property which in the hands of the DISC  is a qualified export asset) which was previously transferred to it in a  transaction in which the transferor realized gain which was not  recognized in whole or in part, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the transferor's gain which was not recognized on  the previous transfer of the property to the DISC.  For purposes of this subparagraph, each item of property shall be  considered separately. See paragraph (d) of this section for special  rules with respect to certain tax-free acquisitions of property by the  DISC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An amount equal to the lower of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any gain recognized by the DISC during such year on the sale or  exchange of property which in the hands of the DISC is a qualified  export asset (other than stock in trade or property described in section  1221(1)) and which was previously transferred to the DISC in a  transaction in which the transferor realized gain which was not  recognized in whole or in part, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the transferor's gain which was not recognized on  the previous transfer of the property to the DISC and which would have  been includible in the transferor's gross income as ordinary income if  its entire realized gain had been recognized upon the transfer.  For purposes of this subparagraph, each item of property shall be  considered separately. See paragraph (d) of this section for special  rules with respect to certain tax-free acquisitions of property by the  DISC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, an amount  equal to 50 percent of the taxable income of the DISC for the taxable  years attributable to military property (as defined in Sec. 1.995-6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, the taxable  income for the taxable year attributable to base period export gross  receipts (as defined in Sec. 1.995-7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a corporate share holder, an amount equal to  57.5 percent of the excess (if any) (one-half for DISCs' taxable years  beginning before January 1, 1983) of the taxable income of the DISC for  such year (computed as provided in Sec. 1.991-1(b)(1)) over the sum of  the amounts deemed distributed for the taxable year in accordance with  subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this paragraph, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a non-corporate share holder, an amount equal to  one-half of the excess (if any) of the taxable income of the DISC for  such year (computed as provided in Sec. 1.991-1(b)(1)) over   the sum of the amounts deemed distributed for the taxable year in  accordance with subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An amount equal to the amount under subdivision (i) of  paragraph (a)(6) of this section multiplied by the international boycott  factor as determined under section 999 (c)(1) , or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In lieu of the amount determined under subdivision (ii)(A) of  paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the amount described under section 999  (c)(2) of such international boycott income, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An amount equal to the sum of any illegal bribes, kickbacks,  or other payments paid by or on behalf of the DISC directly or  indirectly to an official, employee, or agent in fact of a government.  An amount is paid by a DISC where it is paid by any officer, director,  employee, shareholder, or agent of the DISC for the benefit of such  DISC. For purposes of this section, the principles of section 162 (c)  and the regulations thereunder shall apply. The fair market value of an  illegal payment made in the form of property or services shall be  considered the amount of such illegal payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's  loans of the DISC, as of the close of the ``group taxable year'' ending  with such taxable year of the DISC, determined in accordance with  Sec. 1.995-5. The amount of such foreign investment attributable to  producer's loans so determined for any taxable year of a former DISC  shall be deemed distributed as a dividend to the shareholders of such  former DISC on the last day of such taxable year. See Sec. 1.995-3(e)  for the effect that such deemed distribution has on scheduled  installments of deemed distributions of accumulated DISC income under  Sec. 1.995-3(a) upon disqualification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em>. (1) The sum of the amounts described in paragraph (a)(1)  through (a)(6) of this section which is deemed distributed pro rata to  the DISC's shareholders a dividend for any taxable year of the  corporation shall not exceed the DISC's earnings and profits for such  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's  loans of the DISC (as described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section)  which is deemed to be distributed pro rata to the DISC's shareholders as  dividends for any taxable year of the corporation shall not exceed the  lower of the corporation's accumulated DISC income at the beginning of  such year or the corporation's accumulated earnings and profits at the  beginning of such year (but not less than zero)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Increased by any DISC income of the corporation for such year as  defined in Sec. 1.996-3(b)(2) (i.e., any excess of the DISC's earnings  and profits for such year over the sum of the amounts described in  paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Decreased by any deficit in the corporation's earnings and  profits for such year.  Thus, for example, if a DISC has a deficit in accumulated earnings and  profits at the beginning of a taxable year of $10,000, current earnings  and profits of $12,000, no amounts described in paragraphs (a)(1)  through (a)(6) of this section for the year, and foreign investment  attributable to producer's loans for the taxable year of $5,000, the  DISC would have a deemed distribution described in paragraph (a)(7) of  this section of $5,000 for the taxable year. On the other hand, suppose  the DISC had accumulated earnings and profits of $13,000 at the  beginning of the taxable year, accumulated DISC income of $10,000 at the  beginning of the taxable year, a deficit in earnings and profits for the  taxable year of $12,000, no amounts described in paragraphs (a)(1)  through (a)(6) of this section for the taxable year, and foreign  investment attributable to producer's loans for the taxable year of  $5,000. Under these facts the DISC would have no deemed distribution  described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section because the corporation  had no DISC income for the taxable year and the current year's deficit  in earnings and profits subtracted from the DISC's accumulated DISC  income at the beginning of the year produces a negative amount. For  rules relating to the carryover to a subsequent year of the $5,000 of  foreign investment attributable to producer's loans, see Sec. 1.995- 5(a)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of  such paragraph, to the extent thereof; and so forth, and finally to the  amount described in paragraph (b)(6) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Y is a corporation which uses the calendar year as its  taxable year and which elects to be treated as a DISC beginning with  1972. X is its sole shareholder. In 1972, X transfers certain property  to Y in exchange for Y's stock in a transaction in which X does not  recognize gain or loss by reason of the application of section 351(a).  Included in the property transferred to Y is depreciable property  described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section on which X realizes, but  does not recognize by reason of the application of section 1245(b)(3), a  gain of $20,000. If X had sold such property for cash, the $20,000 gain  would have been recognized as ordinary income under section 1245. Also  included in the transfer to Y is 100 shares of stock in a third  corporation (which is not a related foreign export corporation) on which  X realizes, but does not recognize, a gain of $5,000. In 1973, Y sells  such property and recognizes a gain of $25,000 on the depreciable  property and $8,000 on the 100 shares of stock. Y has accumulated  earnings and profits at the beginning of 1973 of $5,000, earnings and  profits for 1973 of $72,000, and taxable income for 1973 of $100,000. At  the beginning of 1973, Y has $6,000 of accumulated DISC income, no  previously taxed income, and a deficit of $1,000 of other earnings and  profits. Under these facts and the additional facts assumed in the table  below, X is treated as having received a deemed distribution taxable as  a dividend of $76,000 on December 31, 1973, determined as follows:  (1) Gross interest derived by Y in 1973 from producer's loans..   $7,000 (2) Amount of gain on depreciable property (lower of Y's          20,000</p><p class="depth0">recognized gain ($25,000) or X's gain not recognized on</p><p class="depth0">section 1245 property ($20,000))..............................

In 1973, X transfers such  property to Y in a second transaction in which X realizes a gain of $20  of which only $4 is recognized. (On December 31, 1973, X's shareholders  are treated as having received a deemed distribution of a dividend which  includes such $4 under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, provided the  limitation in paragraph (b) of this section is met.) In a third  transaction in 1974, Y sells such property and recognizes a gain of $25.  With respect to Y's shareholders on December 31, 1974, the amount  described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section would be limited to  $13, which is the amount of the transferor's gain which was not  recognized on the first transaction ($17) minus the amount of gain  recognized by X on the second transaction ($4).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Z is a DISC using the calendar year as its taxable year.

In a second transaction in  1973, Z exchanges such property for other property in a like-kind  exchange to which section 1031(b) applies and recognizes $10 of a  realized gain of $35. (On December 31, 1973, A   is treated as having received a deemed distribution of a dividend which  includes such $10 under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, provided the  limitation in paragraph (b) of this section is met.) In a third  transaction in 1974, Z sells the property acquired in the like-kind  exchange and recognizes a gain of $25.
