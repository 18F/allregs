                                Sec. 1.1335-1  Elective method; time and manner of making election
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If the taxpayer elects to have the provisions of  section 1333 applicable to any taxable year in which any money or  property is recovered in respect of war loss property, section 1333 will  be applicable by virtue of that election to all taxable years of the  taxpayer beginning after December 31, 1941. Thus, the taxpayer need not  make an election with respect to each separate taxable year in which he  had a recovery. An election for any taxable year in which the taxpayer  had a recovery in respect of a prior war loss is sufficient to make the  provisions of section 1333 applicable not only to war loss recoveries  received by the taxpayer in any past taxable year beginning after  December 31, 1941, but to any recoveries which may be received by the  taxpayer in any future taxable year. Such election once made shall be  irrevocable. The election to have the provisions of section 1333  applicable to any taxable year cannot be made unless the taxpayer  recovers money or property (in respect of a prior war loss) during the  taxable year for which such election is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Manner of election. In all cases the election to have the  provisions of section 1333 apply must be made by the taxpayer not later  than six months from the last day prescribed by law for the filing of  his income tax return for any taxable year in which a recovery of war  loss property has occurred. The election shall be evidenced by a written  statement, made within such 6-month period, that the taxpayer elects to  have the provisions of section 1333 apply to any taxable year in which  any money or property is recovered in respect of war loss property. The  statement may be made in (or attached to):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The return or amended return filed for such taxable year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A claim for refund or credit filed for such taxable year for an  overpayment resulting from application of such provisions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A timely petition or amended petition to The Tax Court of the  United States for a redetermination of any deficiency for any taxable  year in which a recovery of war loss property occurred; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A letter addressed to the district director for the district in  which the return for such taxable year was required to be filed.  If the written statement of election is made in a letter, it shall be  signed by the taxpayer making the election if an individual or, if the  taxpayer is not an individual, the letter must be executed in the same  manner as required in the case of the income tax return of such   taxpayer. The date of the making of the election shall be the date the  return, amended return, claim for refund or credit, or letter is filed  in the office of the district director, or the date the petition or  amended petition is filed with The Tax Court of the United States. In  case the election is made in a return filed before the last day  prescribed by law for the filing thereof (including any extension of  time for such filing), such election shall not be considered made until  such last day. See section 7502 and the regulations thereunder with  respect to the timeliness of filing an election where filing is done by  mail and section 7503 and the regulations thereunder with respect to the  timeliness of filing where the last day for filing falls on a Saturday,  Sunday, or legal holiday.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of election. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the provisions of section 1333 are  applicable to any taxable year pursuant to an election made by the  taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this  section, the period of limitations provided in chapter 66 of the Code on  the making of assessments and the beginning of distraint or a proceeding  in court for collection with respect to (i) the amount to be added to  the tax for such taxable year under the provisions of section 1333 and  (ii) any deficiency for such taxable year or for any other taxable year  to the extent attributable to the basis of the recovered property being  determined under the provisions of section 1336(b), shall not expire  prior to the expiration of two years following the date of the making of  such election. Such amount or such deficiency may be assessed at any  time prior to the expiration of such period, notwithstanding any law or  rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment and  collection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the provisions of section 1333 are applicable to any taxable  year pursuant to an election made by the taxpayer in accordance with the  provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, and refund or credit of any  overpayment resulting from the application of such provisions to such  taxable year is prevented on the date of the making of such election, or  within one year from such date, by the operation of any law or rule of  law (other than section 7122 relating to compromises), refund or credit  of such overpayment may nevertheless be made or allowed, provided claim  therefor is filed within one year from such date. Thus, the amount of  such overpayment which may be refunded or credited is not subject to the  limitations contained in section 6511 or 6512(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of any taxable year ending before the date of the  making by the taxpayer of an election under section 1335, no interest  shall be paid on any overpayment specified in subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph for any period before the expiration of six months following  the date of the making of such election by the taxpayer, and no interest  shall be assessed or collected with respect to any amount or any  deficiency specified in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for any  period before the expiration of six months following the date of the  making of such election by the taxpayer.
