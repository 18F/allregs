Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, you must conduct testing periodically as prescribed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. The date of commencement of the initial comprehensive performance test

is the basis for establishing the deadline to commence the initial confirmatory performance test and the next comprehensive performance test. You may conduct performance testing at any time prior to the required date. The deadline for commencing subsequent confirmatory and comprehensive performance testing is based on the date of commencement of the previous comprehensive performance test. Unless the Administrator grants a time extension under paragraph (i) of this section, you must conduct testing as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Comprehensive performance testing.

If you submit data in lieu of the initial performance test, you must commence the initial confirmatory performance test within 31 months of the date six months after the compliance date. To ensure that the confirmatory test is conducted approximately midway between comprehensive performance tests, the Administrator will not approve a test plan that schedules testing within 18 months of commencing the previous comprehensive performance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Duration of testing. You must complete performance testing within 60 days after the date of commencement, unless the Administrator determines that a time extension is warranted based on your documentation in writing of factors beyond your control that prevent you from meeting the 60-day deadline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Applicable testing requirements under the interim standards--(i) Waiver of periodic comprehensive performance tests. Except as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must conduct only an initial comprehensive performance test under the interim standards (Sec.
