With the exception of the WAI golden king crab  fishery, the Regional Administrator shall annually apportion 10 percent  of the TAC specified by the State of Alaska for each of the fisheries  described in Table 1 to   this part to the Western Alaska CDQ program. Ten percent of the TAC in  the Western Aleutian Islands golden king crab fishery will be allocated  to the Adak community entity.

This amount will represent the maximum amount of crab that may be  harvested from the specified crab QS fishery by the person to whom it is  assigned during the specified crab fishing year, unless the IFQ  assignment is changed by the Regional Administrator because of an  approved transfer, revoked, suspended, or modified under 15 CFR part  904.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The individual has participated as crew in at least one delivery  of crab in any CR crab fishery during the three crab fishing years  preceding the crab fishing year for which the individual is filing an  annual crab IFQ permit application. If the individual holds C share QS  in a single CR crab fishery and that CR crab fishery is closed to  fishing for an entire crab fishing year, NMFS will exclude that crab  fishing year when determining whether the individual has satisfied this  participation requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The individual was an initial recipient of CVC or CPC QS and  participated as crew in at least 30 days of fishing in a commercial  fishery managed by the State of Alaska or in a U.S. commercial fishery  in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone off Alaska during the three crab  fishing years preceding the crab fishing year for which the individual  is filing an annual crab IFQ   permit application. Individuals may combine participation as crew in  State and Federal commercial fisheries to meet this requirement. If the  individual holds C share QS in a single CR crab fishery and that CR crab  fishery is closed to fishing for an entire crab fishing year, NMFS will  exclude that crab fishing year when determining whether the individual  has satisfied this participation requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All of the CVC or CPC QS permits held by the individual were  acquired using the eligibility criteria in 50 CFR 680.41(c)(1)(vii)(B)  and the individual has held those CVC or CPC QS permits for less than  three full crab fishing years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notice of C Share IFQ Withholding. The Regional Administrator  will issue a Notice of C Share IFQ Withholding to an individual holding  CVC or CPC QS if, after reviewing the CVC or CPC QS holder's Application  for Annual Crab IFQ Permit, the Regional Administrator determines that  the CVC or CPC QS holder has failed to meet the participation  requirements in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. A CVC or CPC QS holder  who receives a Notice of C Share IFQ Withholding will have 30 days to  provide the Regional Administrator with information demonstrating  participation as crew that meets the requirements of paragraph (g)(2) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Initial administrative determination (IAD). The Regional  Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the CVC or CPC QS holder  following the expiration of the 30-day evidentiary period if the  Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence  provided by the CVC or CPC QS holder fails to demonstrate participation  as crew and is insufficient to rebut the information included in the CVC  or CPC QS holder's Applications for Annual Crab IFQ Permit, or if the  additional information or evidence is not provided within the time  period specified in the Notice of C Share IFQ Withholding. The IAD will  explain the basis for the withholding of IFQ. A CVC or CPC QS holder who  receives an IAD withholding IFQ may appeal under the appeals procedures  set forth at 15 CFR part 906. A CVC or CPC QS holder who avails himself  or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD withholding IFQ will not  receive crab IFQ until after the final resolution of that appeal in the  QS holder's favor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Calculation of annual IFQ allocation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The  annual allocation of IFQ to any person (p) in any crab QS fishery (f)  will be based on the TAC of crab for that crab QS fishery less the  allocation to the Western Alaska CDQ Program (``CDQ Reserve'') and  Western Aleutian Islands golden king crab fishery. Expressed  algebraically, the annual IFQ allocation formula is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> IFQ TACf = TACf - (CDQ Reservef  + Allocation for the Western Aleutian Island golden king crab fishery)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> IFQpf = IFQ TACf x (QSpf/QS  poolf)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CVO, CPO, CVC, and CPC IFQ. Each year, 3 percent of the IFQ  TACf will be allocated as CVC IFQ or CPC IFQ and 97 percent  of the IFQ TACf will be allocated as CVO IFQ or CPO IFQ.  Expressed algebraically, the formulas for the annual IFQ allocations are  as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> CVC/CPC IFQf = IFQ TACf x 0.03</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> CVO/CPO IFQf = IFQ TACf x 0.97</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Class A/B IFQ. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> QS shall yield Class A or Class B IFQ if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Initially assigned to the CVO QS sector; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Transferred to the CVO QS sector from the CPO QS sector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Class A/B IFQ TAC is the portion of the TAC assigned as  Class A/B IFQ under paragraphs (h)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Class A/B IFQ issuance ratio. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Class A and Class B IFQ shall  be assigned on an annual basis such that the total amount of Class A and  B IFQ assigned in a crab fishing year in each crab QS fishery for each  region will be in a ratio of 90 percent Class A IFQ and 10 percent Class  B IFQ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Regional Administrator will determine the amount of Class A  and Class B IFQ that is assigned to each QS holder. The Class A IFQ is  calculated by allocating 90 percent of the Class A/B IFQ TAC (TAC a) to  Class A IFQ. A portion of the IFQ TAC a is allocated to persons eligible  to hold only Class A IFQ (TAC a only), the remaining IFQ TAC (TAC r) is  allocated for harvest by a person (p) eligible to receive both Class A  IFQ and Class B IFQ. Expressed algebraically, for an individual person  (p) eligible to hold both Class A and Class B IFQ the annual allocation  formula is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> TACa = Class A/B IFQ TAC x 0.90</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> TACr = TACa-TACa only</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> IFQap = TACr/(Class A/B IFQ TAC- TACa only) x IFQp</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> IFQbp = IFQp-IFQap</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Class A IFQ and Class B IFQ issuance to IPQ holders. If a person  holds IPQ and IFQ, than that person will be issued Class A IFQ only for  the amount of IFQ equal to the amount of IPQ held by that person. Any  remaining IFQ held by that person will be issued as Class A and Class B  IFQ in a ratio so that the total Class A and Class B IFQ issued in that  crab QS fishery is issued as 90 percent Class A IFQ and 10 percent Class  B IFQ;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Class A IFQ and Class B IFQ issuance to persons affiliated with  IPQ holders. If an IPQ holder holds IPQ in excess of the amount of IFQ  held by that person, all IFQ holders affiliated with that IPQ holder  will receive only Class A IFQ in proportion to the amount of IFQ held by  those affiliated persons relative to that amount of IPQ held by that IPQ  holder. Any remaining IFQ held by persons affiliated with the IPQ holder  will be issued as Class A and Class B IFQ in a ratio so that the total  Class A and Class B IFQ issued in that fishery is issued as 90 percent  Class A IFQ and 10 percent Class B IFQ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> CVC IFQ. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> QS that is initially allocated to the CVC QS sector  shall yield CVC IFQ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CVC IFQ is not subject to regional designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> CPO IFQ. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> QS that is initially allocated to the CPO QS sector  shall yield CPO IFQ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CPO IFQ is not subject to regional designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> CPC IFQ. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> QS that is initially allocated to the CPC QS sector  shall yield CPC IFQ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CPC IFQ is not subject to regional designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> QS amounts for IFQ calculation.

IPQ is assigned based on the  underlying PQS. The Regional Administrator shall assign crab IPQs to  each person who submits a complete annual application for crab IFQ/IPQ  permit as described under Sec. 680.4. Each assigned IPQ will be  specific to a crab QS fishery with the appropriate regional designation.  This amount will represent the maximum amount of crab that may be  received from the specified crab QS fishery by the person to whom it is  assigned during the specified crab fishing year, unless the IPQ  assignment is changed by the Regional Administrator because of an  approved transfer, revoked, suspended, or modified under 15 CFR part  904.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Calculation of annual IPQ allocation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. The annual  allocation of TAC to PQS and the resulting IPQ in any crab QS fishery  (f) is the Class A IFQ TAC (TACa). A person's annual IPQ is  based on the amount of PQS held by a person (PQS p) divided by the PQS  pool for that crab QS fishery for all PQS holders (PQS pool f).  Expressed algebraically, the annual IPQ allocation formula is as  follows:  IPQpf = TACaf x PQSpf/PQS  poolf.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> PQS amounts for IPQ calculation. For purposes of calculating  IPQs for any crab fishing year, the amount of a person's PQS and the  amount of the PQS pool for any crab PQS fishery will be the amounts on  record with the Alaska Region, NMFS, at the time of calculation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> IPQ issuance limits. The amount of IPQ issued in any crab  fishing year shall not exceed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 157,500,000 raw crab pounds (71,441.5 mt) in the BSS crab QS  fishery; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 18,000,000 raw crab pounds (8,164.7 mt) in the BBR crab QS  fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> IPQ issued to Blue Dutch, LLC--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> BBR IPQ. For each crab  fishing year that the total allowable catch for BBR CR crab is greater  than 15,732,480 lb (7,136.2 mt), NMFS will issue IPQ for the 3,015,229  units of PQS issued to Blue Dutch, LLC, pursuant to Public Law 109-241.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> BSS IPQ. For each crab fishing year that the total allowable  catch for BSS CR crab is greater than 21,350,640 lb (9,684.6 mt), NMFS  will issue IPQ for the 7,516,253 units of PQS issued to Blue Dutch, LLC,  pursuant to Public Law 109-241.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Timing for issuance of IFQ or IPQ. IFQ and IPQ will be issued  once the TAC for that crab QS fishery in that crab fishing year has been  specified by the State of Alaska. All IFQ and IPQ for all persons will  be issued once for a crab fishing year for a crab QS fishery. QS issued  after NMFS has issued annual IFQ for a crab QS fishery for a crab  fishing year will not result in IFQ for that crab QS fishery for that  crab fishing year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Harvesting and processing privilege. QS and PQS allocated or  permits issued pursuant to this part do not represent either an absolute  right to the resource or any interest that is subject to the ``takings''  provision of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Rather, such  QS, PQS, or permits represent only a harvesting or processing privilege  that may be revoked or amended pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Act and  other applicable law. IPQs do not create a right, title, or interest in  any crab until that crab is purchased from a fisherman.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Participation requirements for retention of CVC QS and CPC QS.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Beginning July 1, 2019, and each crab fishing year thereafter,  individuals allocated CVC QS or CPC QS must meet the participation  requirements set forth in paragraphs (m)(2)(i) or (m)(2)(ii) of this  section in order to retain their CVC QS or CPC QS unless the CVC or CPC  QS holder meets the exemption provided in paragraph (m)(5) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The individual has participated as crew in at least one  delivery of crab in any CR crab fishery during the previous four  consecutive crab fishing years.
