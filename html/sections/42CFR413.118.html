                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis and scope. This section implements section 1833(a)(4) and (i)(3) of the Act and establishes the method for determining Medicare payments for services related to covered ambulatory surgical center (ASC) procedures performed in a hospital on an outpatient basis. It does not apply to services furnished by an ASC operated by a hospital that has an agreement with CMS to be paid in accordance with Sec. 416.30 of this chapter. (For regulations governing ASCs see part 416 of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth2">Facility services are those items and services, as specified in Sec. 416.61 of this chapter, that are furnished by a hospital on an outpatient basis in connection with covered ASC surgical procedures, as described in Sec. 416.65 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2">Standard overhead amount means an amount equal to the prospectively determined payment rate that would be paid for the procedure if it had been furnished by an ASC in the same geographic area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment principle. The aggregate amount of payments for facility services, furnished in a hospital on an outpatient basis, that are related to covered ASC surgical procedures (covered under Sec. 416.65 of this chapter) is equal to the lesser of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The hospital's reasonable cost or customary charges, as determined in accordance with Sec. 413.13, reduced by deductibles and coinsurance; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The blended payment amount as described in paragraph (d) of this section, which is based on hospital-specific cost and charge data and rates paid to free-standing ASCs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Blended payment amount. (1) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1987 but before October 1, 1988, the blended payment amount is equal to the sum of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1987 but before October 1, 1988, the blended payment amount is equal to the sum of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 75 percent of the hospital-specific amount (the lesser of the hospital's reasonable cost or customary charges, reduced by deductibles and coinsurance); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 25 percent of the ASC payment amount (that is, 80 percent of the result obtained by subtracting the deductibles from the sum of the standard overhead amounts.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the period of time beginning with the first day of a hospital's cost reporting period that begins on or after October 1, 1988 and ends on December 31, 1990, the blended payment amount is equal to 50 percent of the hospital-specific amount and 50 percent of the ASC payment amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For portions of cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 1991, the blended payment amount is equal to 42 percent of the hospital-specific amount and 58 percent of the ASC payment amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1988 and before January 1, 1995, the blended payment amount is equal to the sum of 75 percent of the hospital-specific amount and 25 percent of the ASC payment amount for a hospital that makes an application to its contractor and meets the following requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> More than 60 percent of the hospital's inpatient hospital discharges, as described in Sec. 412.60 of this chapter, occurring during its cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1986 and before October 1, 1987, are classified in diagnosis related groups 36 through 74.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> During its cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1986 and before October 1, 1987, more than 30 percent of the hospital's total revenues is derived from outpatient services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For portions of cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, for purposes of calculating the blended payment amount under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the ASC payment amount is the sum of the standard overhead amounts reduced by deductibles and coinsurance as defined in section 1866(a)(2)(ii) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Aggregation of cost, charges, and the blended amount. For purposes of determining the correct payment amount under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, all reasonable costs and customary charges attributable to facility services furnished during a cost reporting period are aggregated and treated separately from the reasonable costs

and customary charges attributable to all other services furnished in the hospital.
