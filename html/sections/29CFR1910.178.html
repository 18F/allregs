                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This section contains safety  requirements relating to fire protection, design, maintenance, and use  of fork trucks, tractors, platform lift trucks, motorized hand trucks,  and other specialized industrial trucks powered by electric motors or  internal combustion engines. This section does not apply to compressed  air or nonflammable compressed gas-operated industrial trucks, nor to  farm vehicles, nor to vehicles intended primarily for earth moving or  over-the-road hauling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All new powered industrial trucks acquired and used by an  employer shall meet the design and construction requirements for powered  industrial trucks established in the ``American National Standard for  Powered Industrial Trucks, Part II, ANSI B56.1-1969'', which is  incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 1910.6, except for  vehicles intended primarily for earth moving or over-the-road hauling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Approved trucks shall bear a label or some other identifying  mark indicating approval by the testing laboratory. See paragraph (a)(7)  of this section and paragraph 405 of ``American National Standard for  Powered Industrial Trucks, Part II, ANSI B56.1-1969'', which is  incorporated by reference in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and which  provides that if the powered industrial truck is accepted by a  nationally recognized testing laboratory it should be so marked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Modifications and additions which affect capacity and safe  operation shall not be performed by the customer or user without  manufacturers prior written approval. Capacity, operation, and  maintenance instruction plates, tags, or decals shall be changed  accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than  factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be  marked to identify the attachments and show the approximate weight of  the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load  laterally centered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The user shall see that all nameplates and markings are in place  and are maintained in a legible condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> As used in this section, the term, approved truck or approved  industrial truck means a truck that is listed or approved for fire  safety purposes for the intended use by a nationally recognized testing  laboratory, using nationally recognized testing standards. Refer to  Sec. 1910.155(c)(3)(iv)(A) for definition of listed, and to Sec. 1910.7  for definition of nationally recognized testing laboratory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Designations. For the purpose of this standard there are eleven  different designations of industrial trucks or tractors as follows: D,  DS, DY, E, ES, EE, EX, G, GS, LP, and LPS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The D designated units are units similar to the G units except  that they are diesel engine powered instead of gasoline engine powered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The DS designated units are diesel powered units that are  provided with additional safeguards to the exhaust, fuel and electrical  systems. They may be used in some locations where a D unit may not be  considered suitable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The DY designated units are diesel powered units that have all  the safeguards of the DS units and in addition do not have any  electrical equipment including the ignition and are equipped with  temperature limitation features.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The E designated units are electrically powered units that have  minimum acceptable safeguards against inherent fire hazards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The ES designated units are electrically powered units that, in  addition to all of the requirements for the E   units, are provided with additional safeguards to the electrical system  to prevent emission of hazardous sparks and to limit surface  temperatures. They may be used in some locations where the use of an E  unit may not be considered suitable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The EE designated units are electrically powered units that  have, in addition to all of the requirements for the E and ES units, the  electric motors and all other electrical equipment completely enclosed.  In certain locations the EE unit may be used where the use of an E and  ES unit may not be considered suitable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The EX designated units are electrically powered units that  differ from the E, ES, or EE units in that the electrical fittings and  equipment are so designed, constructed and assembled that the units may  be used in certain atmospheres containing flammable vapors or dusts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The G designated units are gasoline powered units having minimum  acceptable safeguards against inherent fire hazards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The GS designated units are gasoline powered units that are  provided with additional safeguards to the exhaust, fuel, and electrical  systems. They may be used in some locations where the use of a G unit  may not be considered suitable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The LP designated unit is similar to the G unit except that  liquefied petroleum gas is used for fuel instead of gasoline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> The LPS designated units are liquefied petroleum gas powered  units that are provided with additional safeguards to the exhaust, fuel,  and electrical systems. They may be used in some locations where the use  of an LP unit may not be considered suitable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> The atmosphere or location shall have been classified as to  whether it is hazardous or nonhazardous prior to the consideration of  industrial trucks being used therein and the type of industrial truck  required shall be as provided in paragraph (d) of this section for such  location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Designated locations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The industrial trucks specified under  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph are the minimum types required but  industrial trucks having greater safeguards may be used if desired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For specific areas of use, see Table N-1 which tabulates the  information contained in this section.

The quantity of hazardous material that might escape in case  of accident, the adequacy of ventilating equipment, the total area  involved, and the record of the industry or business with respect to  explosions or fires are all factors that should receive consideration in  determining whether or not the DS or DY, ES, EE, GS, LPS designated  truck possesses sufficient safeguards for the location. Piping without  valves, checks, meters and similar devices would not ordinarily be  deemed to introduce a hazardous condition even though used for hazardous  liquids or gases.

The following definitions help to explain the  principle of stability:</p><p class="depth0">Center of gravity is the point on an object at which all of the  object's weight is concentrated. For symmetrical loads, the center of  gravity is at the middle of the load.</p><p class="depth0">Counterweight is the weight that is built into the truck's basic  structure and is used to offset the load's weight and to maximize the  vehicle's resistance to tipping over.</p><p class="depth0">Fulcrum is the truck's axis of rotation when it tips over.</p><p class="depth0">Grade is the slope of a surface, which is usually measured as the  number of feet of rise or fall over a hundred foot horizontal distance  (the slope is expressed as a percent).</p><p class="depth0">Lateral stability is a truck's resistance to overturning sideways.</p><p class="depth0">Line of action is an imaginary vertical line through an object's  center of gravity.</p><p class="depth0">Load center is the horizontal distance from the load's edge (or the  fork's or other attachment's vertical face) to the line of action  through the load's center of gravity.</p><p class="depth0">Longitudinal stability is the truck's resistance to overturning  forward or rearward.</p><p class="depth0">Moment is the product of the object's weight times the distance from  a fixed point (usually the fulcrum). In the case of a powered industrial  truck, the distance is measured from the point at which the truck will  tip over to the object's line of action. The distance is always measured  perpendicular to the line of action.</p><p class="depth0">Track is the distance between the wheels on the same axle of the  truck.</p><p class="depth0">Wheelbase is the distance between the centerline of the vehicle's  front and rear wheels.</p><p class="depth0">A-2. General.</p><p class="depth0">A-2.1. Determining the stability of a powered industrial truck is  simple once a few basic principles are understood. There are many  factors that contribute to a vehicle's stability: the vehicle's  wheelbase, track, and height; the load's weight distribution; and the  vehicle's counterweight location (if the vehicle is so equipped).</p><p class="depth0">A-2.2. The ``stability triangle,'' used in most stability  discussions, demonstrates stability simply.</p><p class="depth0">A-3. Basic Principles.</p><p class="depth0">A-3.1. Whether an object is stable depends on the object's moment at  one end of a system being greater than, equal to, or smaller than the  object's moment at the system's other end. This principle can be seen in  the way a see-saw or teeter-totter works: that is, if the product of the  load and distance from the fulcrum (moment) is equal to the moment at  the device's other end, the device is balanced and it will not move.  However, if there is a greater moment at one end of the device, the  device will try to move downward at the end with the greater moment.</p><p class="depth0">A-3.2. The longitudinal stability of a counterbalanced powered  industrial truck depends on the vehicle's moment and the load's moment.  In other words, if the mathematic product of the load moment (the  distance from the front wheels, the approximate point at which the  vehicle would tip forward) to the load's center of gravity times the  load's weight is less than the vehicle's moment, the system is balanced  and will not tip forward. However, if the load's moment is greater than  the vehicle's moment, the greater load-moment will force the truck to  tip forward.</p><p class="depth0">A-4. The Stability Triangle.</p><p class="depth0">A-4.1. Almost all counterbalanced powered industrial trucks have a  three-point suspension system, that is, the vehicle is supported at  three points. This is true even if the vehicle has four wheels. The  truck's steer axle is attached to the truck by a pivot pin in the axle's  center. When the points are connected with imaginary lines, this three- point support forms a triangle called the stability triangle. Figure 1  depicts the stability triangle.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01DE98.002</p><p class="depth0">A-4.2. When the vehicle's line of action, or load center, falls  within the stability triangle, the vehicle is stable and will not tip  over. However, when the vehicle's line of action or the vehicle/load  combination falls outside the stability triangle, the vehicle is  unstable and may tip over. (See Figure 2.)   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01DE98.003</p><p class="depth0">A-5.  Longitudinal Stability.</p><p class="depth0">A-5.1. The axis of rotation when a truck tips forward is the front  wheels' points of contact with the pavement. When a powered industrial  truck tips forward, the truck will rotate about this line. When a truck  is stable, the vehicle-moment must exceed the load-moment. As long as  the vehicle-moment is equal to or exceeds the load-moment, the vehicle  will not tip over. On the other hand, if the load moment slightly  exceeds the vehicle-moment, the truck will begin to tip forward, thereby  causing the rear to lose contact with the floor or ground and resulting  in loss of steering control. If the load-moment greatly exceeds the  vehicle moment, the truck will tip forward.</p><p class="depth0">A-5.2. To determine the maximum safe load-moment, the truck  manufacturer normally rates the truck at a maximum load at a given  distance from the front face of the forks. The specified distance from  the front face of the forks to the line of action of the load is  commonly called the load center. Because larger trucks normally handle  loads that are physically larger, these vehicles have greater load  centers. Trucks with a capacity of 30,000 pounds or less are normally  rated at a given load weight at a 24-inch load center. Trucks with a  capacity greater than 30,000 pounds are normally rated at a given load  weight at a 36- or 48-inch load center. To safely operate the vehicle,  the operator should always check the data plate to determine the maximum  allowable weight at the rated load center.</p><p class="depth0">A-5.3. Although the true load-moment distance is measured from the  front wheels, this   distance is greater than the distance from the front face of the forks.  Calculating the maximum allowable load-moment using the load-center  distance always provides a lower load-moment than the truck was designed  to handle. When handling unusual loads, such as those that are larger  than 48 inches long (the center of gravity is greater than 24 inches) or  that have an offset center of gravity, etc., a maximum allowable load- moment should be calculated and used to determine whether a load can be  safely handled. For example, if an operator is operating a 3000 pound  capacity truck (with a 24-inch load center), the maximum allowable load- moment is 72,000 inch-pounds (3,000 times 24). If a load is 60 inches  long (30-inch load center), then the maximum that this load can weigh is  2,400 pounds (72,000 divided by 30).</p><p class="depth0">A-6.  Lateral Stability.</p><p class="depth0">A-6.1. The vehicle's lateral stability is determined by the line of  action's position (a vertical line that passes through the combined  vehicle's and load's center of gravity) relative to the stability  triangle. When the vehicle is not loaded, the truck's center of gravity  location is the only factor to be considered in determining the truck's  stability. As long as the line of action of the combined vehicle's and  load's center of gravity falls within the stability triangle, the truck  is stable and will not tip over. However, if the line of action falls  outside the stability triangle, the truck is not stable and may tip  over. Refer to Figure 2.</p><p class="depth0">A-6.2. Factors that affect the vehicle's lateral stability include  the load's placement on the truck, the height of the load above the  surface on which the vehicle is operating, and the vehicle's degree of  lean.</p><p class="depth0">A-7.  Dynamic Stability.</p><p class="depth0">A-7.1. Up to this point, the stability of a powered industrial truck  has been discussed without considering the dynamic forces that result  when the vehicle and load are put into motion. The weight's transfer and  the resultant shift in the center of gravity due to the dynamic forces  created when the machine is moving, braking, cornering, lifting,  tilting, and lowering loads, etc., are important stability  considerations.</p><p class="depth0">A-7.2. When determining whether a load can be safely handled, the  operator should exercise extra caution when handling loads that cause  the vehicle to approach its maximum design characteristics. For example,  if an operator must handle a maximum load, the load should be carried at  the lowest position possible, the truck should be accelerated slowly and  evenly, and the forks should be tilted forward cautiously. However, no  precise rules can be formulated to cover all of these eventualities.
