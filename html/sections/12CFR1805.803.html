The Fund shall not provide any assistance (other than technical assistance) under this part until an Awardee has satisfied any conditions set forth in its Assistance Agreement and has secured in-hand and/or firm commitments for the matching funds required for such assistance pursuant to the applicable Notice of Funds Availability. At a minimum, a firm commitment must consist of a written agreement between an Awardee and the source of the matching funds that is conditioned only upon the availability of the Fund's assistance and such other conditions as the Fund, in its sole discretion, may deem appropriate. Such agreement must provide for disbursal of the matching funds to an Awardee prior to, or simultaneously with, receipt by an Awardee of the Federal funds.</p>
