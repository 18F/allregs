                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority to execute commission. Under the provisions of section  1 of the act of June 25, 1948, as amended (sec. 1, 62 Stat. 834, sec.  53, 63 Stat. 96; 18 U.S.C. 3492), a diplomatic or consular officer may  be commissioned by an United States court to take the testimony of a  witness in a foreign country either on oral or written interrogatories,  or partly on oral and partly on written interrogatories, for the purpose  of determining the genuineness of any foreign document (any book, paper,  statement, record, account, writing, or other document, or any portion  thereof, of whatever character and in whatever form, as well as any copy  thereof equally with the original, which is not in the United States)  which it is desired to introduce in evidence in any criminal action or  proceeding in any United States court under the provisions of section 1  of the act of June 25, 1948 (sec. 1, 62 Stat. 945; 28 U.S.C. 1732). Such  testimony may also be taken to determine whether the foreign document  was made in the regular course of business and whether it was the  regular course of business to make such document. The term ``business''  includes business, profession, occupation, and calling of every kind.  (Sec. 1, 62 Stat. 945, 28 U.S.C. 1732.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disqualification to execute commission. Any diplomatic or  consular officer to whom a commission is addressed to take testimony,  who is interested in the outcome of the criminal action or proceeding in  which the foreign documents in question are intended to be used or who  has participated in the prosecution of such action or proceeding,  whether by investigations, preparation of evidence, or otherwise, may be  disqualified on his own motion or on that of the United States or any  other party to such criminal action or proceeding made to the court from  which the commission issued at any time prior to the execution thereof.  If, after notice and hearing, the court grants the motion, it will  instruct the diplomatic or consular officer thus disqualified to send  the commission to any other diplomatic or consular officer of the United  States named by the court, and such other officer should execute the  commission according to its terms and will for all purposes be deemed  the officer to whom the commission is addressed. (Section 1, 62 Stat.  834, sec. 53, 63 Stat. 96; 18 U.S.C. 3492.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Execution and return of commission. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commissions issued in  criminal cases under the authority of the act of June 25, 1948, as  amended, to take testimony in connection with foreign documents should  be executed and returned by officers of the Foreign Service in  accordance with section 1 of that act, as amended (sec. l, 62 Stat. 835;  18 U.S.C. 3493, 3494), and in accordance with any special instructions  which may accompany the commission. For details not covered by such  section or by special instructions, officers of the Foreign Service  should be guided by such instructions as may be issued by the Department  of State in connection with the taking of depositions generally. (See  Sec. Sec. 92.55 to 92.64.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 1 of the act of June 25, 1948 (sec. 1, 62 Stat. 835; 18  U.S.C. 3493) provides that every person whose testimony is taken should  be cautioned and sworn to testify the whole truth and should be  carefully examined. The testimony should be reduced to writing or  typewriting by the consular officer, or by some person under his  personal supervision, or by the witness himself in the presence of the  consular officer, and by no other person. After it has been reduced to  writing or typewriting, the testimony must be signed by the witness.  Every foreign document with respect to which testimony is taken must be  annexed to such testimony and must be signed by each witness who appears  for the purpose of establishing the genuineness of such document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When counsel for all of the parties attend the examination of  any witness whose testimony will be taken on written interrogatories,  they may consent that oral interrogatories, in addition to those  accompanying the commission, be put to the witness. The consular officer  taking the testimony   should require an interpreter to be present when his services are needed  or are requested by any party or his attorney. (Section 1, 62 Stat. 835,  18 U.S.C. 3493.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Section 1 of the act of June 25, 1948 (sec. 1, 62 Stat. 835; 18  U.S.C. 3494) provides that the consular officer, who executes any  commission authorized under the same section, as amended (sec. 1, 62  Stat. 834, sec. 53, 63 Stat. 96; 18 U.S.C. 3492) and who is satisfied,  upon all the testimony taken, that a foreign document is genuine, should  certify such document to be genuine under the seal of his office. This  certification must include a statement that the officer is not subject  to disqualification under the provisions of section 1 of the act of June  25, 1948, as amended (sec. 1, 62 Stat. 834, sec. 53, 63 Stat. 96; 18  U.S.C. 3492). For purposes of assessment of fees, the issuance of this  certificate shall be regarded as a part of the consular service of  executing the commission, and no separate fee shall be charged for the  certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The consular officer should then forward such foreign documents,  together with the record of all testimony taken and the commission which  has been executed, to the Department of State for transmission to the  clerk of the court from which the commission issued. (Section 1, 62  Stat. 835; 18 U.S.C. 3494.) (See Sec. 92.64 regarding the filing of  depositions generally.)  (Sec. 303, 60 Stat. 1002, 62 Stat. 836; 22 U.S.C. 843, 18 U.S.C. 3496,  E.O. 10307; 16 FR 11907, 3 CFR 1949-1953 Comp., page 387)</p>
