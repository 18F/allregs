                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Regulations in this part provide for approved uses of drugs and  combinations of drugs in animal feeds. Approved combinations of such  drugs are specifically identified or incorporated by cross-reference.  Unless specifically provided for by the regulations, a combination of  two or more drugs is not approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following definitions apply to terms used in this part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New animal drugs approved for use in animal feed are placed in  two categories as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Category I--These drugs require no withdrawal period at the  lowest use level in each species for which they are approved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Category II--These drugs require a withdrawal period at the  lowest use level for at least one species for which they are approved,  or are regulated on a ``no-residue'' basis or with a zero tolerance  because of a carcinogenic concern regardless of whether a withdrawal  period is required, or are a veterinary feed directive drug.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A ``Type A medicated article'' is intended solely for use in the  manufacture of another Type A medicated article or a Type B or Type C  medicated feed. It consists of a new animal drug(s), with or without  carrier (e.g., calcium carbonate, rice hull, corn, gluten) with or  without inactive ingredients. The manufacture of a Type A medicated  article requires an application approved under Sec. 514.105 of this  chapter or an index listing granted under Sec. 516.151 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A ``Type B medicated feed'' is intended solely for the  manufacture of other medicated feeds (Type B or Type C). It contains a  substantial quantity of nutrients including vitamins and/or minerals  and/or other nutritional ingredients in an amount not less than 25  percent of the weight. It is manufactured by diluting a Type A medicated  article or another Type B medicated feed. The maximum concentration of  animal drug(s) in a Type B medicated feed is 200 times the highest  continuous use level for Category I drugs and 100 times the highest  continuous use level for Category II drugs. The term ``highest  continuous use level'' means the highest dosage at which the drug is  approved for continuous use (14 days or more), or, if the drug is not  approved for continuous use, it means the highest level used for disease  prevention or control. If the drug is approved for multiple species at  different use levels, the highest approved level of use would govern  under this definition. The manufacture of a Type B medicated feed from a  Category II, Type A medicated article requires a medicated feed mill  license application approved under Sec. 515.20 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A ``Type C medicated feed'' is intended as the complete feed for  the animal or may be fed ``top dressed'' (added on top of usual ration)  on or offered ``free-choice'' (e.g., supplement) in conjunction with  other animal feed. It contains a substantial quantity of nutrients  including vitamins, minerals, and/or other nutritional ingredients. It  is manufactured by diluting a Type A medicated article or a Type B  medicated feed. A Type C medicated feed may be further diluted to  produce another Type C medicated feed. The manufacture of a Type C  medicated feed from a Category II, Type A medicated article requires a  medicated feed mill license application approved under Sec. 515.20 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A Type B or Type C medicated feed manufactured from a drug  component (bulk or ``drum-run'' (dried crude fermentation product))  requires an application approved under Sec. 514.105 of this chapter or  an index listing granted under Sec. 516.151 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A ``veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug'' is a new animal drug  approved under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic  Act (the act) or listed in the index under section 572 of the act for  use in or on animal feed. Use of a VFD drug must be under the  professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A ``veterinary feed directive'' is a written statement issued by  a licensed veterinarian in the course of the veterinarian's professional  practice that   orders the use of a VFD drug in or on an animal feed. This written  statement authorizes the client (the owner of the animal or animals or  other caretaker) to obtain and use the VFD drug in or on an animal feed  to treat the client's animals only in accordance with the directions for  use approved or indexed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A  veterinarian may issue a VFD only if a valid veterinarian-client-patient  relationship exists, as defined in Sec. 530.3(i) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A ``medicated feed'' means a Type B medicated feed as defined in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section or a Type C medicated feed as defined  in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> For the purposes of this part, a ``distributor'' means any  person who distributes a medicated feed containing a VFD drug to another  distributor or to the client-recipient of the VFD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> An ``animal production facility'' is a location where animals  are raised for any purpose, but does not include the specific location  where medicated feed is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> An ``acknowledgment letter'' is a written communication  provided to a distributor by a consignee who is not the ultimate user of  medicated feed containing a VFD drug. An acknowledgment letter affirms  that the consignee will not ship such medicated animal feed to an animal  production facility that does not have a VFD, and will not ship such  feed to another distributor without receiving a similar written  acknowledgment letter.
