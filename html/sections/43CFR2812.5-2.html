                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A permittee shall pay a basic fee of $5 per year per mile or  fraction thereof for the use of any existing road or of any road  constructed by the permittee upon the right-of-way. If the term of the  permit is for 5 years or less, the entire basic fee must be paid in  advance of the issuance of the permit. If the term of the permit is  longer than 5 years, the basic fee for each 5-year period or for the  remainder of the last period, if less than 5 years, must be paid in  advance at 5-year intervals: Provided, however, That in those cases  where the permittee has executed under Sec. Sec. 2812.3-1 to 2812.3-5  an agreement respecting the use of roads, rights-of-way or lands, no  such basic fee shall be paid: Provided further, This paragraph shall not  apply where payment for road use is required under Sec. 2812.3-1(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, as may be applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an application is filed to use a road built on O. and C.  lands by the applicant or his predecessor in interest under a permit  which has expired, the authorized officer may issue a new permit which  provides that as to such road the applicant's road use payments shall be  determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section except that  he shall be required to pay a road use fee which is adequate to amortize  only his proportionate share of any capital improvements which have been  or may be placed on the road by the United States or its licensees  together with a reasonable interest allowance thereon plus cost of  maintenance if furnished by the United States: Provided,   however, That if the application is for use of a road which has been  built by a predecessor in interest the permit shall provide that the  applicant may use the road only for the purpose of reaching the lands of  the predecessor in interest that were served by the road. As a condition  for the granting of such a permit, the applicant must comply with  Sec. Sec. 2812.3-1 to 2812.3-5 to the extent that rights-of-way and  road use rights are needed to manage lands of the United States or to  remove timber therefrom.</p>
