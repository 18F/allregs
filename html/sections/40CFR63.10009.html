                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General eligibility. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may use emissions averaging as  described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section as an alternative to  meeting the requirements of Sec. 63.9991 for filterable PM,  SO2, HF, HCl, non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg on an EGU-specific  basis if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You have more than one existing EGU in the same subcategory  located at one or more contiguous properties, belonging to a single  major industrial grouping, which are under common control of the same  person (or persons under common control); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You use CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring systems for  determining Hg emissions) or quarterly emissions testing for  demonstrating compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may demonstrate compliance by emissions averaging among the  existing EGUs in the same subcategory, if your averaged Hg emissions for  EGUs in the ``unit designed for coal "8,300 Btu/lb'' subcategory are  equal to or less than 1.0 lb/TBtu or 1.1E-2 lb/GWh or if your averaged  emissions of individual, other pollutants from other subcategories of  such EGUs are equal to or less than the applicable emissions   limit in Table 2, according to the procedures in this section. Note that  except for Hg emissions from EGUs in the ``unit designed for coal "8,300  Btu/lb'' subcategory, the averaging time for emissions averaging for  pollutants is 30 days (rolling daily) using data from CEMS or a  combination of data from CEMS and manual performance testing. The  averaging time for emissions averaging for Hg from EGUs in the ``unit  designed for coal "8,300 Btu/lb'' subcategory is 90 days (rolling daily)  using data from CEMS, sorbent trap monitoring, or a combination of  monitoring data and data from manual performance testing. For the  purposes of this paragraph, 30- (or 90-day) group boiler operating days  is defined as a period during which at least one unit in the emissions  averaging group has operated 30 (or 90) days. You must calculate the  weighted average emissions rate for the group in accordance with the  procedures in this paragraph using the data from all units in the group  including any that operate fewer than 30 (or 90) days during the  preceding 30 (or 90) group boiler days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You may choose to have your EGU emissions averaging group meet  either the heat input basis (MMBtu or TBtu, as appropriate for the  pollutant) or gross electrical output basis (MWh or GWh, as appropriate  for the pollutant).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You may not mix bases within your EGU emissions averaging  group.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You may use emissions averaging for affected units in  different subcategories if the units vent to the atmosphere through a  common stack (see paragraph (m) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Equations.

For a group of two or more existing  EGUs in the same subcategory that each vent to a separate stack, you may  average filterable PM, SO2, HF, HCl, non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg  emissions to demonstrate compliance with the limits in Table 2 to this  subpart if you satisfy the requirements in paragraphs (d) through (j) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For each existing EGU in the averaging group:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The emissions rate achieved during the initial performance test  for the HAP being averaged must not exceed the emissions level that was  being achieved 180 days after April 16, 2015, or the date on which  emissions testing done to support your emissions averaging plan is  complete (if the Administrator does not require submission and approval  of your emissions averaging plan), or the date that you begin emissions  averaging, whichever is earlier; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The control technology employed during the initial performance  test must not be less than the design efficiency of the emissions  control technology employed 180 days after April 16, 2015 or the date  that you begin emissions averaging, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The weighted-average emissions rate from the existing EGUs  participating in the emissions averaging option must be in compliance  with the limits in Table 2 to this subpart at all times following the  compliance date specified 180 days after April 16, 2015, or the date on  which you complete the emissions measurements used to support your  emissions averaging plan (if the Administrator does not require  submission and approval of your emissions averaging plan), or the date  that you begin emissions averaging, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(1)</em> or  (2) of this section using the maximum normal operating load of each EGU  and the results of the initial performance tests. For this demonstration  and prior to submitting your emissions averaging plan, if requested, you  must conduct required emissions monitoring for 30 days of boiler  operation and any required manual performance testing to calculate an  initial weighted average emissions rate in accordance with this section.  Should the Administrator require approval, you must submit your proposed  emissions averaging plan and supporting data at least 120 days before  April 16, 2015. If the Administrator requires approval of your plan, you  may not begin using emissions averaging   until the Administrator approves your plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must use Equation 1a in paragraph (b) of this section to  demonstrate that the maximum weighted average emissions rates of  filterable PM, HF, SO2, HCl, non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg  emissions from the existing units participating in the emissions  averaging option do not exceed the emissions limits in Table 2 to this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you are not capable of monitoring heat input or gross  electrical output, and the EGU generates steam for purposes other than  generating electricity, you may use Equation 1b of this section as an  alternative to using Equation 1a of this section to demonstrate that the  maximum weighted average emissions rates of filterable PM, HF,  SO2, HCl, non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg emissions from the  existing units participating in the emissions averaging group do not  exceed the emission limits in Table 2 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(1)</em> through (2)  of this section. The first averaging period begins on 30 (or 90 for Hg)  days after February 16, 2015 or the date that you begin emissions  averaging, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must use Equation 2a or 3a of paragraph (b) of this section  to calculate the weighted average emissions rate using the actual heat  input or gross electrical output for each existing unit participating in  the emissions averaging option.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you are not capable of monitoring heat input or gross  electrical output, you may use Equation 2b or 3b of paragraph (b) of  this section as an alternative to using Equation 2a of paragraph (b) of  this section to calculate the average weighted emission rate using the  actual steam generation from the units participating in the emissions  averaging option.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring) use. If an EGU in your  emissions averaging group uses CEMS (or a sorbent trap monitor for Hg  emissions) to demonstrate compliance, you must use those data to  determine the 30 (or 90) group boiler operating day rolling average  emissions rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Emissions testing. If you use manual emissions testing to  demonstrate compliance for one or more EGUs in your emissions averaging  group, you must use the results from the most recent performance test to  determine the 30 (or 90) day rolling average. You may use CEMS or  sorbent trap data in combination with data from the most recent manual  performance test in calculating the 30 (or 90) group boiler operating  day rolling average emissions rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)(1)</em> and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> through (v) of this section in your implementation plan for  all the emissions units included in an emissions averaging:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The identification of all existing EGUs in the emissions  averaging group, including for each either the applicable HAP emission  level or the control technology installed as of 180 days after February  16, 2015, or the date on which you complete the emissions measurements  used to support your emissions averaging plan (if the Administrator does  not require submission and approval of your emissions averaging plan),  or the date that you begin emissions averaging, whichever is earlier;  and the date on which you are requesting emissions averaging to  commence;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The process weighting parameter (heat input, gross electrical  output, or steam generated) that will be monitored for each averaging  group;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The specific control technology or pollution prevention  measure to be used for each emission EGU in the averaging group and the  date of its installation or application. If the pollution prevention  measure reduces or eliminates emissions from multiple EGUs, you must  identify each EGU;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The means of measurement (e.g., CEMS, sorbent trap monitoring,  manual performance test) of filterable PM, SO2, HF, HCl,  individual or total non-   Hg HAP metals, or Hg emissions in accordance with the requirements in  Sec. 63.10007 and to be used in the emissions averaging calculations;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A demonstration that emissions averaging can produce compliance  with each of the applicable emission limit(s) in accordance with  paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Administrator requests you to submit the plan for review  and approval, you must submit a complete implementation plan at least  120 days before April 16, 2015. If the Administrator requests you to  submit the plan for review and approval, you must receive approval  before initiating emissions averaging.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Administrator shall use following criteria in reviewing and  approving or disapproving the plan:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Whether the content of the plan includes all of the information  specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Whether the plan presents information sufficient to determine  that compliance will be achieved and maintained.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator shall not approve an emissions averaging  implementation plan containing any of the following provisions:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any averaging between emissions of different pollutants or  between units located at different facilities; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The inclusion of any emissions unit other than an existing unit  in the same subcategory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Common stack requirements. For a group of two or more existing  affected units, each of which vents through a single common stack, you  may average emissions to demonstrate compliance with the limits in Table  2 to this subpart if you satisfy the requirements in paragraph (l) or  (m) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> For a group of two or more existing units in the same  subcategory and which vent through a common emissions control system to  a common stack that does not receive emissions from units in other  subcategories or categories, you may treat such averaging group as a  single existing unit for purposes of this subpart and comply with the  requirements of this subpart as if the group were a single unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> For all other groups of units subject to paragraph (k) of this  section, you may elect to conduct manual performance tests according to  procedures specified in Sec. 63.10007 in the common stack. If emissions  from affected units included in the emissions averaging and from other  units not included in the emissions averaging (e.g., in a different  subcategory) or other nonaffected units all vent to the common stack,  you must shut down the units not included in the emissions averaging and  the nonaffected units or vent their emissions to a different stack  during the performance test. Alternatively, you may conduct a  performance test of the combined emissions in the common stack with all  units operating and show that the combined emissions meet the most  stringent emissions limit. You may also use a CEMS or sorbent trap  monitoring to apply this latter alternative to demonstrate that the  combined emissions comply with the most stringent emissions limit on a  continuous basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Combination requirements. The common stack of a group of two or  more existing EGUs in the same subcategory subject to paragraph (k) of  this section may be treated as a single stack for purposes of paragraph  (c) of this section and included in an emissions averaging group subject  to paragraph (c) of this section.
