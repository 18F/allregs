In general, the Secretary  considers the compliance audit and audited financial statement  submission requirements of this section to be satisfied by an audit  conducted in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget  Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit  Organizations, or the audit guides developed by and available from the  Department of Education's Inspector General, whichever is applicable to  the entity, and provided that the Federal student aid functions  performed by that entity are covered in the submission.

As part of these financial statements, the institution must  include a detailed description of related entities based on the  definition of a related entity as set forth in the Statement of  Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 57. The disclosure requirements  under this provision extend beyond those of SFAS 57 to include all  related parties and a level of detail that would enable to Secretary to  readily identify the related party.

The servicer must  also notify every institution that contracts with the servicer for the  same service that the Secretary determined that a liability was owed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Repayments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An institution or third-party servicer that must  repay   funds under the procedures in this section shall repay those funds at  the direction of the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the  Secretary's notification, unless--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The institution or servicer files an appeal under the procedures  established in subpart H of this part;

or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The terms of the surety or guarantee do not provide complete  assurance that recourse to that protection will be fully available  through the completion of available appeal proceedings; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Secretary may use administrative offset pursuant to 34 CFR  part 30 to collect the funds owed under the procedures of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, under the proceedings in subpart H, liabilities asserted in  the Secretary's notification, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, to  the institution or third-party servicer are upheld, the institution or  third-party servicer must repay those funds at the direction of the  Secretary within 30 days of the final decision under subpart H of this  part unless--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary permits a longer repayment period; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Secretary determines that earlier collection action is  appropriate pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An institution is held responsible for any liability owed by the  institution's third-party servicer for a violation incurred in servicing  any aspect of that institution's participation in the title IV, HEA  programs and remains responsible for that amount until that amount is  repaid in full.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Audit submission requirements for foreign institutions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Audited financial statements. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary waives for that fiscal  year the submission of audited financial statements if the institution  is a foreign public or nonprofit institution that received less than  $500,000 in U.S. title IV program funds during its most recently  completed fiscal year, unless that foreign public or nonprofit  institution is in its initial provisional period of participation, and  received title IV program funds during that fiscal year, in which case  the institution must submit, in English, audited financial statements  prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of  the institution's home country.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, a  foreign institution that received $500,000 or more in U.S. title IV  program funds during its most recently completed fiscal year must  submit, in English, for each most recently completed fiscal year in  which it received title IV program funds, audited financial statements  prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of  the institution's home country along with corresponding audited  financial statements that meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In lieu of making the submission required by paragraph  (h)(1)(ii) of this section, a public or private nonprofit institution  that received--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> $500,000 or more in U.S. title IV program funds, but less than  $3,000,000 in U.S. title IV program funds during its most recently  completed fiscal year, may submit for that year, in English, audited  financial statements prepared in accordance with the generally accepted  accounting principles of the institution's home country, and is not  required to submit the corresponding audited financial statements that  meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At least $3,000,000, but less than $10,000,000 in U.S. title IV,  program funds during its most recently completed fiscal year, must  submit in English, for each most recently completed fiscal year, audited  financial   statements prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting  principles of the institution's home country along with corresponding  audited financial statements that meet the requirements of paragraph (d)  of this section, except that an institution that continues to receive at  least $3,000,000 but less than $10,000,000, in U.S. title IV funds  during its most recently completed fiscal year may omit the audited  financial statements that meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this  section for up to two consecutive years following the submission of  audited financial statements that meet the requirements of paragraph (d)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compliance audits.
