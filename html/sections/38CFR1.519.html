                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any organization wanting a list of names and addresses of  present or former personnel of the armed services and their dependents  from the Department of Veterans Affairs must make written application to  the Department of Veterans Affairs Controller, except lists of  educationally disadvantaged veterans should be requested from the  Director of the nearest regional office. The application must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clearly identify the type or category of names and addresses  sought;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Furnish proof satisfactory to the Department of Veterans Affairs  that the organization seeking the list is a ``nonprofit organization.''  Normally, evidence establishing that the organization is exempt from  taxation in accordance with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 501 or is a  governmental body or institution will be accepted as satisfying this  criteria;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contain a statement clearly setting forth the purpose for which  the list is sought, the programs and the resources the organization  proposes to devote to this purpose, and establish how such purpose is  ``directly connected with the conduct of programs and the utilization of  benefits'' under title 38, U.S.C.; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Contain a certification that the organization, and all members  thereof who will have access to the list, are aware of the penalty  provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5701(f) and will not use the list for any  purpose other than that stated in the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Director of the regional office concerned finds that the  organization requesting the list of names and addresses of educationally  disadvantaged veterans is a nonprofit organization and operates an  approved program of special secondary, remedial, preparatory or other  educational or supplementary assistance to veterans as provided under  subchapter V, title 38 U.S.C., then he or she may authorize the release  of such names and addresses to the organization requesting them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information  Resources Management, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, is  authorized to release lists of names and addresses to organizations  which have applied for such lists in accordance with paragraph (a) of  this section if he or she finds that the purpose for which the  organization desires the names and addresses is directly connected with  the conduct of programs and the utilization of benefits under title 38  U.S.C. Lists of names and addresses authorized to be released pursuant  to this paragraph shall not duplicate lists released to other elements,  segments, or chapters of the same organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the list requested is one that the Department of Veterans  Affairs has previously compiled or created, in the same format, to carry  out one or more of its basic program responsibilities and it is  determined that it can be released, the list may be furnished without  charge. For other types of lists, a charge will be made in accordance  with the provisions of Sec.  1.526.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon denial of a request, the Department of Veterans Affairs  Controller or Regional Office Director will inform the requester in  writing of the denial and the reasons therefor and advise the  organization that it may appeal the denial to the General Counsel. In  each instance of a denial of a request, the denial and the reasons  therefor will be made a matter of record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em>, title 38 U.S.C., provides that any  organization, or member thereof, which uses the names and addresses  furnished it for any purpose other than one directly connected with the  conduct of programs and the utilization of benefits under title 38  U.S.C., shall be fined not more than $500 in the case of the first  offense and not more than $5,000 in the case of the subsequent offenses.  Any instance in which there is evidence of a violation of these penal  provisions will be reported in accordance with Sec.  14.560.
