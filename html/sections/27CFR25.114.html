                            <p class="depth0">Every dealer is required to maintain records of transactions. Beer transactions that appear in the records required by subpart U of this part will meet the brewer's recordkeeping requirements as a dealer. For other transactions not covered in the brewery records, such as retail sales of wine or distilled spirits in a restaurant at the brewery, or operations as a wholesale dealer in wine or distilled spirits, the brewer must keep the records specified for dealers in part 31 of this chapter.
