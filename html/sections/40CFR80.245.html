                                Sec. 80.245  How does a small refiner apply for a sulfur baseline?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any refiner seeking small refiner status must apply for a  refinery sulfur baseline by the deadline under Sec. 80.235 for each of  the refiner's refineries by providing the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A sulfur baseline and baseline volume for every refinery  calculated in accordance with Sec. 80.250.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following information for each batch of gasoline produced in  1997-1998:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Volume; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Sulfur content.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For any refiner that acquires and/or reactivates a refinery that  was shut down or non-operational between January 1, 1997, and December  31, 1998, the average sulfur level and average volume of gasoline  produced during each annual averaging period that the refinery was in  operation after the refinery was acquired and/or reactivated. EPA will  evaluate all of the information and data submitted by the refiner in  determining the appropriate sulfur baseline for the refinery. Where EPA  concludes that the data submitted reasonably reflects current sulfur  levels, the refinery's baseline will be determined based on the average  sulfur content of gasoline produced by the refinery during the most  recent annual averaging period in which the refinery was in operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Foreign refiners who do not have an approved individual  refinery baseline under Sec. 80.94 must follow the procedures specified  in Sec. 80.410(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Foreign refiners who have an approved individual refinery  baseline under Sec. 80.94, but one that was not in effect for purposes  of anti-dumping compliance during the 1997-1998 annual averaging  periods, must comply with the requirements of this section for the  gasoline produced at the refinery and imported into the United States  during each of the annual averaging periods in which the refinery was  subject to its individual anti-dumping baseline. EPA will evaluate all  of the information and data submitted under this section in determining  the foreign refinery's sulfur baseline pursuant to this paragraph. Where  EPA concludes that the   data submitted reasonably reflects current sulfur levels, the refinery's  baseline will be determined based on the annual average sulfur level and  volume of gasoline produced by the foreign refinery and imported into  the U.S. during the most recent annual averaging period in which the  refinery was subject to its individual anti-dumping baseline.
