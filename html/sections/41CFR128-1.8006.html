                            <p class="depth0">The Department Seismic Safety Coordinator and each Component Seismic  Safety Coordinator shall ensure that an individual familiar with seismic  design provisions of the Seismic Safety Standards (appropriate  standards), or a professional, licensed engineer shall conduct the  reviews required under this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> New building projects. Construction documents initiated after  August 12, 1993, and which apply to new construction projects, shall  comply with the appropriate standards and shall be reviewed for  compliance. Once the reviewer determines that the documents comply, the  reviewer shall affix his/her   signature and seal (if a licensed engineer) to the approved documents  and provide a statement certifying compliance with the appropriate  standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Existing building projects. For new buildings with construction  documents that were initiated prior to August 12, 1993, the documents  shall be reviewed to determine whether they comply with the appropriate  standards. If the reviewer determines that the documents comply with the  standard, the reviewer shall affix his/her signature and seal (if a  licensed engineer) to the approved documents and provide a statement  certifying compliance with the appropriate standards. If the reviewer  determines that seismic deficiencies exist, the appropriate Component  Head shall ensure completion of one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a new building project for which a contract for construction  has not been awarded, the construction documents shall be revised to  incorporate the appropriate standards. The revised construction  documents shall then be reviewed for compliance. Once the reviewer  determines that the documents comply with the standard, the reviewer  shall affix his/her signature and seal (if a licensed engineer) to the  approved documents and provide a statement certifying compliance with  the Department standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a new building under construction, or for which construction  has been completed, a corrective action plan shall be devised to bring  the building into compliance with the appropriate standards. The plan  shall then be reviewed for compliance. Once the reviewer determines that  the plan complies with the standard, the reviewer shall affix his/her  signature and seal (if a licensed engineer) to the approved documents  and provide a statement certifying compliance with the Department  standards. The Component Head shall ensure implementation of the  approved plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For an addition to an existing building, the review shall  account for, in addition to the requirements provided in paragraphs (b)  (1) or (2) of this section, as appropriate, any effect the addition will  have on the seismic resistance of the existing portion of the structure.  If the reviewer determines that the addition will decrease the level of  seismic resistance of the existing building, the appropriate Component  Head shall develop a plan of corrective action to restore the seismic  integrity of the existing structure. Once the plan of corrective action  has been accomplished, the reviewer shall verify that the current level  of seismic resistance of the existing building at least equals the  seismic resistance level of the building before the addition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department Seismic Safety Coordinator and each Component  Seismic Safety Coordinator shall ensure that statements verifying  compliance made under this subpart have been completed and retained by  the appropriate contracting officer when the Department contracted for  design or design review services, or by an individual designated by the  Component Head where the Department has not contracted for either design  or design review.</p>
