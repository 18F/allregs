                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirement. The Destination Control Statement (DCS) must be entered on the invoice and on the bill of lading, air waybill, or other export control document that accompanies the shipment from its point of origin in the United States to the ultimate consignee or end-user abroad. The person responsible for preparation of those documents is responsible for entry of the DCS. The DCS is required for all exports from the United States of items on the Commerce Control List that are not classified as EAR99, unless the export may be made under License Exception BAG or GFT (see part 740 of the EAR). At a minimum, the DCS must state: ``These commodities, technology, or software were exported from the United States in accordance with the Export Administration Regulations. Diversion contrary to U.S. law is prohibited.'' Compliance with the requirements described in Sec. 123.9(b) of the ITAR constitutes compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (a) for shipments containing both items subject to the EAR and defense articles subject to the ITAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional requirement for 9x515 and ``600 series'' items. In addition to the destination control statement required in paragraph (a), the ECCN for each 9x515 or ``600 series'' item being exported must be printed on the invoice and on the bill of lading, air waybill, or other export control document that accompanies the shipment from its point of origin in the United States to the ultimate consignee or end user abroad.
