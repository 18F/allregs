necessary, to reflect that the acquisition is an 8(a) contract awarded under the authority of the Partnership Agreement cited in 2419.800.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The contracting officer shall include SBA's requirement number on the contract unless the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A single award document shall be used between HUD and the 8(a) contractor. As such, no signature on the part of the SBA is required; a single signature by the HUD contracting officer shall suffice. The 8(a) contractor's signature shall be placed on the award document as the prime contractor. The 8(a) contractor's name and address shall be placed in the ``awarded to'' or ``contractor name'' block on the appropriate forms.
