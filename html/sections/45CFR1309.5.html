program, as demonstrated by a statement that neither the grantee's current facility nor any facility available for lease or purchase in the service area is suitable or could be made suitable without major renovation. This statement must explain the factors considered, how it was determined that there is a lack of suitable facilities and be supported, whenever possible, by written statement from a licensed real estate professional in the grantee's service area.
