                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standards. All parties and their representatives, attorneys, and any experts/consultants retained by them or their attorneys, must obey directions and orders prescribed by the Board and adhere to standards of conduct applicable to such parties and persons. As to an attorney, the standards include the

rules of professional conduct and ethics of the jurisdictions in which an attorney is licensed to practice, to the extent that those rules are relevant to conduct affecting the integrity of the Board, its process, and its proceedings. The Board will also look to professional guidelines in evaluating an individual's conduct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Imposition of sanctions. (1) When a party or its representative or attorney or any expert/consultant fails to comply with any direction or order issued by the Board (including an order to provide or permit discovery), or engages in misconduct affecting the Board, its process, or its proceedings, the Board may make such orders as are just, including the imposition of appropriate sanctions. The sanctions may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a party or its representative or attorney or any expert/consultant fails to comply with any direction or order issued by the Board (including an order to provide or permit discovery), or engages in misconduct affecting the Board, its process, or its proceedings, the Board may make such orders as are just, including the imposition of appropriate sanctions. The sanctions may include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Taking the facts pertaining to the matter in dispute to be established for the purpose of the appeal in accordance with the contention of the party submitting the discovery request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Forbidding challenge of the accuracy of any evidence;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Refusing to allow the noncompliant party to support or pose designated claims or defenses;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Prohibiting the noncompliant party from introducing in evidence designated documents or items of testimony;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Striking pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Dismissing the appeal or any part thereof; and/or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Imposing such other sanctions as the Board deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to imposing sanctions, the Board will provide the noncompliant party with notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue of whether sanctions should be imposed. The opportunity to be heard does not mean that the party is entitled to a hearing; the opportunity to provide written argument shall satisfy this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disciplinary proceedings. In addition to the above procedures, the Board may discipline individual party representatives, attorneys, and experts/consultants for a violation of any Board order or direction or standard of conduct applicable to such individual where the violation affects the integrity of the Board's process or proceedings. Sanctions may be public or private and may include admonishment, disqualification from a particular matter, referral to an appropriate licensing authority, or such other action as circumstances may warrant. The Board, in its discretion, may suspend an individual from appearing before the Board as a party representative, attorney, or expert/consultant if, after affording such individual notice and an opportunity to be heard, a majority of all members of the Contact Appeals Board determines that such sanction is warranted.</p>
