This account may be a checking, savings, or similar account that underlies a stored-value card or other transaction device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An institution may establish a policy requiring its students to provide bank account information or open an account at a bank of their choosing as long as this policy does not delay the disbursement of title IV, HEA program funds to students. Consequently, if a student does not comply with the institution's policy, the institution must nevertheless disburse the funds to the student using a method described in paragraph (c) of this section in accordance with any timeframes required under subpart k of this part. In cases where the institution opens a bank account on behalf of a student or parent, establishes a process the student or parent follows to open a bank account, or similarly assists the student or parent in opening a bank account, the institution must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Obtain in writing affirmative consent from the student or parent to open that account;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Before the account is opened, inform the student or parent of the terms

and conditions associated with accepting and using the account;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Not make any claims against the funds in the account without the written permission of the student or parent, except for correcting an error in transferring the funds in accordance with banking protocols;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Ensure that the student or parent does not incur any cost in opening the account or initially receiving any type of debit card, stored-value card, other type of automated teller machine (ATM) card, or similar transaction device that is used to access the funds in that account;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Ensure that the student has convenient access to a branch office of the bank or an ATM of the bank in which the account was opened (or an ATM of another bank), so that the student does not incur any cost in making cash withdrawals from that office or these ATMs. This branch office or these ATMs must be located on the institution's campus, in institutionally-owned or operated facilities, or, consistent with the meaning of the term ``Public Property'' as defined in Sec.  668.46(a), immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Ensure that the debit, stored-value or ATM card, or other device can be widely used, e.g., the institution may not limit the use of the card or device to particular vendors; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Not market or portray the account, card, or device as a credit card or credit instrument, or subsequently convert the account, card, or device to a credit card or credit instrument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Crediting a student's account at the institution. An institution may use title IV, HEA program funds to credit a student's account at the institution to satisfy--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Current year charges for--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tuition and fees;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Board, if the student contracts with the institution for board;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Room, if the student contracts with the institution for room; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the institution obtains the student's or parent's authorization under Sec.  668.165(b), other educationally related charges incurred by the student at the institution; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior award year charges for a total of not more than $200 for--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tuition and fees, room, or board; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the institution obtains the student's or parent's authorization under Sec.  668.165(b), other educationally related charges incurred by the student at the institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Credit balances.
