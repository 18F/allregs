The proposal shall be submitted to the  contracting officer within the time limit indicated in the request or  any extension thereto subsequently granted. The proposal shall provide  an itemized breakdown of all increases and decreases in the contract for  the Contractor and each subcontractor in at least the following detail:  material quantities and costs; direct labor hours and rates for each  trade; the associated FICA, FUTA, SUTA, and Workmen's Compensation  Insurance; and equipment hours and rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The overhead percentage cited below shall be considered to  include all indirect costs including, but not limited to, field and  office supervisors and assistants, incidental job burdens, small tools,  and general overhead allocations. ``Commission'' is defined as profit on  work performed by others. The percentages for overhead, profit, and  commission are negotiable according to the nature, extent, and  complexity of the work involved, but in no case shall they exceed the  following ceilings:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Overhead      Profit</p><p class="depth2"><em>(percent)</em>    (percent)    Commission ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To Contractor on work performed by other than its own forces.............           --           --           10 To first tier subcontractor on work performed by its subcontractors......           --           --           10 To Contractor and/or subcontractors on work performed with their own                10           10           --</p><p class="depth2">forces.................................................................. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Not more than four percentages for overhead, profit, and  commission shall be allowed regardless of the number of subcontractor  tiers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Contractor or subcontractor shall not be allowed overhead or  commission on the overhead, profit, and/or commission received by its  subcontractors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Equitable adjustments for deleted work shall include credits,  limited to the same percentages for overhead, profit, and commission in  paragraph (b) of this clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> On proposals covering both increases and decreases in the amount  of the contract, the application of the overhead, profit, and   commission shall be on the net change in direct costs for the Contractor  or the subcontractor performing the work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> After receipt of the Contractor's proposal, the contracting  officer shall act within a reasonable period, provided that when the  necessity to proceed with a change does not permit time to properly  check the proposal, or in the event of a failure to reach an agreement  on a proposal, the contracting officer may order the Contractor to  proceed on the basis of the price being determined at the earliest  practicable date. In such a case, the price shall not be more than the  increase or less than the decrease proposed.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [63 FR 17339, Apr. 9, 1998]</p>
