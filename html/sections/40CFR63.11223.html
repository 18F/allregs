                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For affected sources subject to the work practice standard or  the management practices of a tune-up, you must conduct a performance  tune-up according to paragraph (b) of this section and keep records as  required in Sec. 63.11225(c) to demonstrate continuous compliance. You  must conduct the tune-up while burning the type of fuel (or fuels in the  case of boilers that routinely burn two types of fuels at the same time)  that provided the majority of the heat input to the boiler over the 12  months prior to the tune-up.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em>  through (7) of this section. Each biennial tune-up must be conducted no  more than 25 months after the previous tune-up. For a new or  reconstructed boiler, the first biennial tune-up must be no later than  25 months after the initial startup of the new or reconstructed boiler.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As applicable, inspect the burner, and clean or replace any  components of the burner as necessary (you may delay the burner  inspection until the next scheduled unit shutdown, not to exceed 36  months from the previous inspection). Units that produce electricity for  sale may delay the burner inspection until the first outage, not to  exceed 36 months from the previous inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inspect the flame pattern, as applicable, and adjust the burner  as necessary to optimize the flame pattern. The adjustment should be  consistent with the manufacturer's specifications, if available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspect the system controlling the air-to-fuel ratio, as  applicable, and ensure that it is correctly calibrated and functioning  properly (you may delay the inspection until the next scheduled unit  shutdown, not to exceed 36 months from the previous inspection). Units  that produce electricity for sale may delay the inspection until the  first outage, not to exceed 36 months from the previous inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Optimize total emissions of CO. This optimization should be  consistent with the manufacturer's specifications, if available, and  with any nitrogen oxide requirement to which the unit is subject.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Measure the concentrations in the effluent stream of CO in parts  per million, by volume, and oxygen in volume percent, before and after  the adjustments are made (measurements may be either on a dry or wet  basis, as long as it is the same basis before and after the adjustments  are made). Measurements may be taken using a portable CO analyzer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)(i)</em> through  (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The concentrations of CO in the effluent stream in parts per  million, by volume, and oxygen in volume percent, measured at high fire  or typical operating load, before and after the tune-up of the boiler.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of any corrective actions taken as a part of the  tune-up of the boiler.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The type and amount of fuel used over the 12 months prior to  the tune-up   of the boiler, but only if the unit was physically and legally capable  of using more than one type of fuel during that period. Units sharing a  fuel meter may estimate the fuel use by each unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the unit is not operating on the required date for a tune-up,  the tune-up must be conducted within 30 days of startup.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boilers with an oxygen trim system that maintains an optimum  air-to-fuel ratio that would otherwise be subject to a biennial tune-up  must conduct a tune-up of the boiler every 5 years as specified in  paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section. Each 5-year tune-up must  be conducted no more than 61 months after the previous tune-up. For a  new or reconstructed boiler with an oxygen trim system, the first 5-year  tune-up must be no later than 61 months after the initial startup. You  may delay the burner inspection specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section and inspection of the system controlling the air-to-fuel ratio  specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section until the next scheduled  unit shutdown, but you must inspect each burner and system controlling  the air-to-fuel ratio at least once every 72 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Seasonal boilers must conduct a tune-up every 5 years as  specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section. Each 5-year  tune-up must be conducted no more than 61 months after the previous  tune-up. For a new or reconstructed seasonal boiler, the first 5-year  tune-up must be no later than 61 months after the initial startup. You  may delay the burner inspection specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section and inspection of the system controlling the air-to-fuel ratio  specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section until the next scheduled  unit shutdown, but you must inspect each burner and system controlling  the air-to-fuel ratio at least once every 72 months. Seasonal boilers  are not subject to the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart or the  operating limits in Table 3 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Oil-fired boilers with a heat input capacity of equal to or less  than 5 million Btu per hour must conduct a tune-up every 5 years as  specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section. Each 5-year  tune-up must be conducted no more than 61 months after the previous  tune-up. For a new or reconstructed oil-fired boiler with a heat input  capacity of equal to or less than 5 million Btu per hour, the first 5- year tune-up must be no later than 61 months after the initial startup.  You may delay the burner inspection specified in paragraph (b)(1) of  this section and inspection of the system controlling the air-to-fuel  ratio specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section until the next  scheduled unit shutdown, but you must inspect each burner and system  controlling the air-to-fuel ratio at least once every 72 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Limited-use boilers must conduct a tune-up every 5 years as  specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section. Each 5-year  tune-up must be conducted no more than 61 months after the previous  tune-up. For a new or reconstructed limited-use boiler, the first 5-year  tune-up must be no later than 61 months after the initial startup. You  may delay the burner inspection specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section and inspection of the system controlling the air-to-fuel ratio  specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section until the next scheduled  unit shutdown, but you must inspect each burner and system controlling  the air-to-fuel ratio at least once every 72 months. Limited-use boilers  are not subject to the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart, the  energy assessment requirements in Table 2 to this subpart, or the  operating limits in Table 3 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If you own or operate a boiler subject to emission limits in  Table 1 of this subpart, you must minimize the boiler's startup and  shutdown periods following the manufacturer's recommended procedures, if  available. If manufacturer's recommended procedures are not available,  you must follow recommended procedures for a unit of similar design for  which manufacturer's recommended procedures are available. You must  submit a signed statement in the Notification of Compliance Status  report that indicates that you conducted startups and shutdowns  according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures or procedures  specified for a boiler of similar design   if manufacturer's recommended procedures are not available.
