The acquisition of mitigation credits in wetland or natural  habitat mitigation banks shall be accomplished through a legally  recognized instrument, such as permanent easement, deed restriction, or  legally approved mitigation banking instrument, which provides for the  protection and permanent continuation of the wetland or natural habitat  nature of the mitigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A State DOT may acquire privately owned lands in cooperation  with another public agency or third party.   Such an arrangement may accomplish greater benefits than would otherwise  be accomplished by the individual agency acting alone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A State DOT may transfer the title to, or enter into an  agreement with, an appropriate public natural resource management agency  to manage lands acquired outside the right-of-way without requiring a  credit to Federal funds. Any such transfer of title or agreement shall  require the continued use of the lands for the purpose for which they  were acquired. In the event the purpose is no longer served, the lands  and interests therein shall immediately revert to the State DOT for  proper disposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The reasonable costs of acquiring lands or interests therein to  provide replacement lands with equivalent wetlands or natural habitat  area or functional capacity associated with these areas are eligible for  Federal participation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The objective in mitigating impacts to wetlands in the Federal- aid highway program is to implement the policy of a net gain of wetlands  on a program wide basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Certain activities to ensure the viability of compensatory  mitigation wetlands or natural habitats during the period of  establishment are eligible for Federal-aid participation. These include,  but are not limited to, such activities as repair or adjustment of water  control structures, pest control, irrigation, fencing modifications,  replacement of plantings, and mitigation site monitoring. The  establishment period should be specifically determined by the mitigation  agreement among the mitigation planners prior to beginning any  compensatory mitigation activities.</p><p class="depth2">SUBCHAPTER I_PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION</p>
