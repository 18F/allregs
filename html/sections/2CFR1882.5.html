                            <p class="depth0">This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 182, as supplemented by this part, as the NASA policies and procedures for implementing the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 701-707, as amended, hereafter referred to as ``the Act'') that applies to grants and cooperative agreements. It thereby gives regulatory effect for NASA to the OMB guidance. Further, it supplements the OMB guidance with NASA-specific regulation.
