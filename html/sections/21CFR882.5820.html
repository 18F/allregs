                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. An implanted cerebellar stimulator is a device  used to stimulate electrically a patient's cerebellar cortex for the  treatment of intractable epilepsy, spasticity, and some movement  disorders. The stimulator consists of an implanted receiver with  electrodes that are placed on the patient's cerebellum and an external  transmitter for transmitting the stimulating pulses across the patient's  skin to the implanted receiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class III (premarket approval).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date premarket approval application (PMA) or notice of  completion of a product development protocol (PDP) is required. A PMA or  notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with the Food and  Drug Administration on or before September 26, 1984. Any implanted  cerebellar stimulator that was not in commercial distribution before May  28, 1976, or that has not on or before September 26, 1984 been found by  FDA to be substantially equivalent to an implanted cerebellar stimulator  that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 shall have an  approved PMA or declared completed PDP in effect before beginning  commercial distribution.  [44 FR 51730, Sept. 4, 1979, as amended at 49 FR 26574, June 28, 1984]</p>
