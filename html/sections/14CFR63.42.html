                                Sec. 63.42  Flight engineer certificate issued on basis of a foreign
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certificates issued. The holder of a current foreign flight  engineer license issued by a contracting State to the Convention on  International Civil Aviation, who meets the requirements of this  section, may have a flight engineer certificate issued to him for the  operation of civil aircraft of U.S. registry. Each flight engineer  certificate issued under this section specifies the number and State of  issuance of the foreign flight engineer license on which it is based. If  the holder of the certificate cannot read, speak, or understand the  English language, the Administrator may place any limitation on the  certificate that he considers necessary for safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Medical standards and certification. An applicant must submit  evidence that he currently meets the medical standards for the foreign  flight engineer license on which the application for a certificate under  this section is based. A current medical certificate issued under part  67 of this chapter will be excepted as evidence that the applicant meets  those standards. However, a medical certificate issued under part 67 of  this chapter is not evidence that the applicant meets those standards  outside the United States unless the State that issued the applicant's  foreign flight engineer license also accepts that medical certificate as  evidence of the applicant's physical fitness for his foreign flight  engineer license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ratings issued. Aircraft class ratings listed on the applicant's  foreign flight engineer license, in addition to any issued to him after  testing under the provisions of this part, are placed on the applicant's  flight engineer certificate. An applicant without an aircraft class  rating on his foreign flight engineer license may be issued a class  rating if he shows that he currently meets the requirements for  exercising the privileges of his foreign flight engineer license on that  class of aircraft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Privileges and limitations. The holder of a flight engineer  certificate issued under this section may act as a flight engineer of a  civil aircraft of U.S. registry subject to the limitations of this part  and any additional limitations placed on his certificate by the  Administrator. He is subject to these limitations while he is acting as  a flight engineer of the aircraft within or outside the United States.  However, he may not act as flight engineer or in any other capacity as a  required flight crewmember, of a civil aircraft of U.S. registry that is  carrying persons or property for compensation or hire.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Renewal of certificate and ratings. The holder of a certificate  issued under this section may have that certificate and the ratings  placed thereon renewed if, at the time of application for renewal, the  foreign flight engineer license on which that certificate is based is in  effect. Application for the renewal of the certificate and ratings  thereon must be made before the expiration of the certificate.  (Sec. 6, 80 Stat. 937, 49 U.S.C. 1655)  [Doc. No. 8846, 33 FR 18614, Dec. 17, 1968, as amended by Amdt. 63-20,  45 FR 5673, Jan. 24, 1980]</p>
