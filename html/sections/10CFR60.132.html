are on the surface before emplacement or as a result of retrieval from the underground facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Surface facility ventilation. Surface facility ventilation systems supporting waste transfer, inspection, decontamination, processing, or packaging shall be designed to provide protection against radiation exposures and offsite releases as provided in Sec. 60.111(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Radiation control and monitoring--(1) Effluent control. The surface facilities shall be designed to control the release of radioactive materials in effluents during Category 1 design basis events so as to meet the performance objectives of Sec. 60.111(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Effluent control. The surface facilities shall be designed to control the release of radioactive materials in effluents during Category 1 design basis events so as to meet the performance objectives of Sec. 60.111(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effluent monitoring. The effluent monitoring systems shall be designed to measure the amount and concentration of radionuclides in any effluent with sufficient precision to determine whether releases conform to the design requirement for effluent control. The monitoring systems shall be designed to include alarms that can be periodically tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waste treatment. Radioactive waste treatment facilities shall be designed to process any radioactive wastes generated at the geologic repository operations area into a form suitable to permit safe disposal at the geologic repository operations area or to permit safe transportation and conversion to a form suitable for disposal at an alternative site in accordance with any regulations that are applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Consideration of decommissioning. The surface facility shall be designed to facilitate decontamination or dismantlement to the same extent as would be required, under other parts of this chapter, with respect to equivalent activities licensed thereunder.
