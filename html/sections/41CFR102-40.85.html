GSA will not approve a donation to a State Agency for Surplus Property (SASP) unless an eligible donee has been identified. This subpart does not prohibit a SASP from bringing an item requiring special handling into its warehouse or other place of storage, provided that this storage is of a temporary nature, that the storage arrangement is agreeable to all parties involved in the donation, and that the storage location has the necessary facilities, gear, and trained personnel to handle, store, protect, and transport the property. In addition, the following certification (or an equivalent) must be signed by the donee:</p><p class="depth0">I (We), the undersigned, hereby certify that the donee has knowledge and understanding of the nature of the property hereby donated which requires special handling, and will comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations with respect to the care, handling, storage, shipment, and disposal of the property. The donee agrees and certifies that the United States shall not be liable for personal injuries to, disabilities of, or death of the donee or the donee's employees, or any other person arising from or incident to the donation of the property, its use, or its final disposition. Additionally, the donee agrees and certifies to hold the United States harmless from and shall indemnify the United States against any or all debts, liabilities, judgments, costs, demands, suits, actions, or claims of any nature arising from or incident to the donation of the property, its use, or final disposition.
