                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility for certification. Individuals who are eligible to  receive Federal benefits under the FMNP are those, excluding infants 4  months of age or younger, who are currently receiving benefits under WIC  or who are on the waiting list to receive benefits from WIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitations on certification. If necessary to limit the number  of recipients, State agencies may impose additional eligibility  requirements, such as limiting participant certification to certain  geographic areas, or to high priority WIC participants such as pregnant  and breastfeeding women. States may also preclude groups of low priority  persons, such as persons on the waiting list for WIC. Each State agency  must specifically identify these limitations on certification in its  State Plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recipient or household benefit allocation. On a Statewide basis,  State agencies shall elect to allocate and issue benefits either to  recipients or households. A State agency allocating benefits on a  household basis shall not issue more benefits to a household than it  otherwise would if benefits were allocated to individual recipients  within the household. For those State agencies issuing FMNP benefits on  a household basis, each family as defined in Sec. 246.2 of this chapter  shall constitute a separate household. Foods provided, regardless of  method of issuance, are intended for the sole benefit of FMNP recipients  and are not intended to be shared with other non-participating household  members. If a State agency issues benefits on a household basis, data  concerning number and type of recipients must still be provided as  required by Sec. 248.23(b). Recipients shall receive FMNP benefits free  of charge.</p>
