                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting. (1) The chemical substance identified generically as isocyanate compound, modified with methoxysilane (PMN P-01-918) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The significant new uses are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Protection in the workplace. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.63 (a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), (a)(2)(iii), (a)(2)(iv), (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(6). The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators meet the minimum requirement for Sec. 721.63(a)(4): Air-purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with N100 (if oil aerosols absent), R100, or P100 filters; powered air-purifying respirator equipped with a tight-fitting full facepiece and High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters; supplied-air respirator operated in pressure demand or continuous flow mode and equipped with a tight-fitting full facepiece. As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed here, a manufacturer, importer, or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 0.05 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour time-weighted average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to the Sec. 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under 40 CFR 721.30. Persons whose Sec. 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will receive NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding section 5(e) consent order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Hazard communication program. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.72 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) (concentration set 1.0 percent), (f), (g)(1)(i), (g)(1)(ii), (g)(2)(i), (g)(2)(ii), (g)(2)(iv) (use respiratory protection or maintain workplace airborne concentrations at or below an 8-hour

time-weighted average of 0.05 mg/m\3\), (g)(2)(v), and (g)(5). The following statements shall appear on each label as specified in Sec. 721.72(b) and the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) as specified in Sec. 721.72(c): This substance may cause skin irritation and sensitization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.80(q).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specific requirements. The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Recordkeeping. Recordkeeping requirements as specified in Sec. 721.125 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), and (i) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements. The provisions of Sec. 721.185 apply to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section. The provisions of Sec. 721.1725(b)(1) apply to this section.
