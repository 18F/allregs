The cheese shall be packaged in a sanitary manner and  automatic filling and capping equipment shall be used on all small  sizes. The containers shall be checked weighed during the filling  operation to assure they are filled uniformly to not less than the  stated net weight on the container. Also care shall be taken that the  cottage cheese be of uniform consistency at the time of packaging to  assure legal composition in all packages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General identification. Bulk packages containing cottage cheese  shall be adequately and legibly marked with the name of the product, net  weight, name and address of the manufacturer, lot number, code or date  of packaging and any other identification as may be   required.
