                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this subpart, a Part D sponsor must provide enrollees with coverage of the benefits described in paragraph (c) of this section. The benefits may be provided directly by the Part D sponsor or through arrangements with other entities. CMS reviews and approves these benefits consistent with Sec. 423.272, and using written policy guidelines and requirements in this part and other CMS instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Availability of prescription drug plan. A PDP sponsor offering a prescription drug plan must offer the plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To all Part D eligible beneficiaries residing in the plan's service area; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At a uniform premium, with uniform benefits and level of cost-sharing throughout the plan's service area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Types of benefits. The coverage provided by a Part D plan must be qualified prescription drug coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Standard prescription drug coverage. Standard prescription drug coverage includes access to negotiated prices as described under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, provides coverage of Part D drugs, and must meet the following requirements</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Deductible. An annual deductible equal to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For 2006. $250; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For years subsequent to 2006. The amount specified in this paragraph for the previous year, increased by the annual percentage increase specified in paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section, and rounded to the nearest multiple of $5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cost-sharing under the initial coverage limit. (i) Subject to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, coinsurance for actual costs for covered Part D drugs covered under the Part D plan above the annual deductible specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and up to the initial coverage limit under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, that is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Equal to 25 percent of actual cost; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Actuarially equivalent to an average expected coinsurance of no more than 25 percent of actual cost, as determined through processes and methods established under Sec. 423.265(c) and (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tiered copayments. A Part D plan providing actuarially equivalent standard coverage may apply tiered copayments, provided that any tiered copayments are consistent with paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B) and (d)(4) of this section and are approved as described in Sec. 423.272(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tiered cost sharing under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section may not exceed levels annually determined by CMS to be discriminatory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Initial coverage limit.

Coinsurance of five percent of actual cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As determined through processes and methods established under Sec. 423.265(c) and (d), a Part D plan may substitute for cost-sharing under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section an amount that is actuarially equivalent to expected cost-sharing under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Annual out-of-pocket threshold. For purposes of this part, the annual out-of-pocket threshold equals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For 2006. $3,600.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For each year 2007 through 2013.

A Part D sponsor is required to provide its Part D enrollees with access to negotiated prices for covered Part D drugs included in its Part D plan's formulary. Negotiated prices must be provided even if no benefits are payable to the beneficiary for covered Part D drugs because of the application of any deductible or 100 percent coinsurance requirement following satisfaction of any initial coverage limit. Negotiated prices must be provided when the negotiated price for a covered Part D drug under a Part D sponsor's benefit package is less than the applicable cost-sharing before the application of any deductible, before any initial coverage limit, before the annual out-of-pocket threshold, and after the annual out-of-pocket threshold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interaction with Medicaid best price.
