Except as otherwise  provided in paragraph (d) of this section, Secs. 2.201 through 2.207,  Sec. 2.209, and Secs. 2.211 through 2.215 apply without change to   information to which this section applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Data submitted under 40 CFR part 98. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sections 2.201 through  2.215 do not apply to data submitted under 40 CFR part 98 that EPA has  determined, pursuant to sections 114(c) and 307(d) of the Clean Air Act,  to be either of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Emission data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Data not otherwise entitled to confidential treatment pursuant  to section 114(c) of the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and (d)(4) of  this section, Secs. 2.201 through 2.215 do not apply to data submitted  under 40 CFR part 98 data that EPA has determined, pursuant to sections  114(c) and 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, to be entitled to confidential  treatment. EPA shall treat that information as confidential in  accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2.211, subject to paragraph  (d)(4) of this section and Sec. 2.209.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon receiving a request under 5 U.S.C. 552 for data submitted  under 40 CFR part 98 that EPA has determined, pursuant to sections  114(c) and 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, to be entitled to confidential  treatment, the EPA office shall furnish the requestor a notice that the  information has been determined to be entitled to confidential treatment  and that the request is therefore denied. The notice shall include or  cite to the appropriate EPA determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Modification of prior confidentiality determination. A  determination made pursuant to sections 114(c) and 307(d) of the Clean  Air Act that information submitted under 40 CFR part 98 is entitled to  confidential treatment shall continue in effect unless, subsequent to  the confidentiality determination, EPA takes one of the following  actions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> EPA determines, pursuant to sections 114(c) and 307(d) of the  Clean Air Act, that the information is emission data or data not  otherwise entitled to confidential treatment under section 114(c) of the  Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Office of General Counsel issues a final determination,  based on the criteria in Sec. 2.208, stating that the information is no  longer entitled to confidential treatment because of change in the  applicable law or newly-discovered or changed facts. Prior to making  such final determination, EPA shall afford the business an opportunity  to submit comments on pertinent issues in the manner described by  Secs. 2.204(e) and 2.205(b). If, after consideration of any timely  comments submitted by the business, the Office of General Counsel makes  a revised final determination that the information is not entitled to  confidential treatment under section 114(c) of the Clean Air Act, EPA  will notify the business in accordance with the procedures described in  Sec. 2.205(f)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Substantive criteria for use in confidentiality determinations.  Section 2.208 applies to information to which this section applies,  except that information which is emission data, a standard or  limitation, or is collected pursuant to section 211(b)(2)(A) of the Act  is not eligible for confidential treatment. No information to which this  section applies is voluntarily submitted information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Availability of information not entitled to confidential  treatment. Section 2.210 does not apply to information to which this  section applies. Emission data, standards or limitations, and any other  information provided under section 114 or 208 of the Act which is  determined under this subpart not to be entitled to confidential  treatment, shall be available to the public notwithstanding any other  provision of this part. Emission data and standards or limitations  provided in response to a subpoena issued under section 307(a) of the  Act shall be available to the public notwithstanding any other provision  of this part. Information (other than emission data and standards or  limitations) provided in response to a subpoena issued under section  307(a) of the Act, which is determined under this subpart not to be  entitled to confidential treatment, shall be available to the public,  unless EPA determines that the information is exempt from mandatory  disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b) for reasons other than reasons of  business confidentiality and cannot or should not be made available to  the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Disclosure of information relevant to a proceeding. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under  sections 114, 208 and 307 of the Act, any information to   which this section applies may be released by EPA because of the  relevance of the information to a proceeding, notwithstanding the fact  that the information otherwise might be entitled to confidential  treatment under this subpart. Release of information because of its  relevance to a proceeding shall be made only in accordance with this  paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> only if, after consideration  of any timely comments submitted by the business, the General Counsel  determines that the information is relevant to the subject of the  proceeding and the EPA office conducting the proceeding determines that  the public interest would be served by making the information available  to the public. Any affected business shall be given at least 5 days'  notice by the General Counsel prior to making the information available  to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>  only if, after consideration of any timely comments submitted by the  business, the EPA office determines in writing that, for reasons  directly associated with the conduct of the proceeding, the contemplated  disclosure would serve the public interest, and the presiding officer  determines in writing that the information is relevant to a matter in  controversy in the proceeding. The presiding officer may condition  disclosure of the information to a party of record on the making of such  protective arrangements and commitments as he finds to be warranted.  Disclosure to one or more parties of record, under protective  arrangements or commitments, shall not, of itself, affect the  eligibility of information for confidential treatment under the other  provisions of this subpart. Any affected business shall be given at  least 5 days notice by the presiding officer prior to making the  information available to the public or to one or more of the parties of  record to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> only if, after consideration of any timely comments submitted by  the business, the presiding officer determines in writing that (i) the  party of record has   satisfactorily shown that with respect to a significant matter which is  in controversy in the proceeding, the party's ability to participate  effectively in the proceeding will be significantly impaired unless the  information is disclosed to him, and (ii) any harm to an affected  business that would result from the disclosure is likely to be  outweighed by the benefit to the proceeding and to the public interest  that would result from the disclosure. The presiding officer may  condition disclosure of the information to a party of record on the  making of such protective arrangements and commitments as he finds to be  warranted. Disclosure to one or more parties of record, under protective  arrangements or commitments, shall not, of itself, affect the  eligibility of information to confidential treatment under the other  provisions of this subpart. Any affected business shall be given at  least 5 days notice by the presiding officer prior to making the  information available to one or more of the parties of record to the  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Disclosure to authorized representatives. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under sections  114, 208 and 307(a) of the Act, EPA possesses authority to disclose to  any authorized representative of the United States any information to  which this section applies, notwithstanding the fact that the  information might otherwise be entitled to confidential treatment under  this subpart. Such authority may be exercised only in accordance with  paragraph (h) (2) or (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A person under contract or subcontract to the United States  government to perform work in support of EPA in connection with the Act  or regulations which implement the Act may be considered an authorized  representative of the United States for purposes of this paragraph (h).  For purposes of this section, the term ``contract'' includes grants and  cooperative agreements under the Environmental Programs Assistance Act  of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-313), and the term ``contractor'' includes grantees  and cooperators under the Environmental Programs Assistance Act of 1984.  Subject to the limitations in this paragraph (h)(2), information to  which this section applies may be disclosed:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> To a contractor or subcontractor with EPA, if the EPA program  office managing the contract first determines in writing that such  disclosure is necessary in order that the contractor or subcontractor  may carry out the work required by the contract or subcontract; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> To a contractor or subcontractor with an agency other than EPA,  if the EPA program office which provides the information to that agency,  contractor, or subcontractor first determines in writing, in  consultation with the General Counsel, that such disclosure is necessary  in order that the contractor or subcontractor may carry out the work  required by the contract or subcontract.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No information shall be disclosed under this paragraph (h)(2),  unless this contract or subcontract in question provides:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> That the contractor or subcontractor and the contractor's or  subcontractor's employees shall use the information only for the purpose  of carrying out the work required by the contract or subcontract, shall  refrain from disclosing the information to anyone other than EPA without  the prior written approval of each affected business or of an EPA legal  office and shall return to EPA all copies of the information (and any  abstracts or extracts therefrom) upon request by the EPA program office,  whenever the information is no longer required by the contractor or  subcontractor for the performance of the work required under the  contract or subcontract, or upon completion of the contract or  subcontract (where the information was provided to the contractor or  subcontractor by an agency other than EPA, the contractor may disclose  or return the information to that agency);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> That the contractor or subcontractor shall obtain a written  agreement to honor such terms of the contract or subcontract from each  of the contractor's or subcontractor's employees who will have access to  the information, before such employee is allowed such access; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> That the contractor or subcontractor acknowledges and agrees  that the contract or subcontract provisions concerning the use and  disclosure of   business information are included for the benefit of, and shall be  enforceable by, both the United States government and any affected  business having an interest in information concerning it supplied to the  contractor or subcontractor by the United States government under the  contract or subcontract.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No information shall be disclosed under this paragraph (h)(2)  until each affected business has been furnished notice of the  contemplated disclosure by the EPA program office and has been afforded  a period found reasonable by that office (not less than 5 working days)  to submit its comments. Such notice shall include a description of the  information to be disclosed, the identity of the contractor or  subcontractor, the contract or subcontract number, if any, and the  purposes to be served by the disclosure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The EPA program office shall prepare a record of each  disclosure under this paragraph (h)(2), showing the contractor or  subcontractor, the contract or subcontract number, the information  disclosed, the date(s) of disclosure, and each affected business. The  EPA program office shall maintain the record of disclosure and the  determination of necessity prepared under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this  section for a period of not less than 36 months after the date of the  disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A State or local governmental agency which has duties or  responsibilities under the Act, or under regulations which implement the  Act, may be considered an authorized representative of the United States  for purposes of this paragraph (h). Information to which this section  applies may be furnished to such an agency at the agency's written  request, but only if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The agency has first furnished to the EPA office having custody  of the information a written opinion from the agency's chief legal  officer or counsel stating that under applicable State or local law the  agency has the authority to compel a business which possesses such  information to disclose it to the agency, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each affected business is informed of those disclosures under  this paragraph (h)(3) which pertain to it, and the agency has shown to  the satisfaction of an EPA legal office that the agency's use and  disclosure of such information will be governed by State or local law  and procedures which will provide adequate protection to the interests  of affected businesses.
