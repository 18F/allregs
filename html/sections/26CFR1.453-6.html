                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Value of obligations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In transactions included in paragraph  (b)(2) of Sec. 1.453-4, that is, sales of real property   involving deferred payments in which the payments received during the  year of sale exceed 30 percent of the selling price, the obligations of  the purchaser received by the vendor are to be considered as an amount  realized to the extent of their fair market value in ascertaining the  profit or loss from the transaction. Such obligations, however, are not  considered in determining whether the payments during the year of sale  exceed 30 percent of the selling price.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the obligations received by the vendor have no fair market  value, the payments in cash or other property having a fair market value  shall be applied against and reduce the basis of the property sold and,  if in excess of such basis, shall be taxable to the extent of the  excess. Gain or loss is realized when the obligations are disposed of or  satisfied, the amount thereof being the difference between the reduced  basis as provided in the preceding sentence and the amount realized  therefor. Only in rare and extraordinary cases does property have no  fair market value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Repossession of property where title is retained by vendor--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Gain or loss on repossession. If the vendor in sales referred to in  paragraph (a) of this section has retained title to the property and the  purchaser defaults in any of his payments, and the vendor repossesses  the property, the difference between--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The entire amount of the payments actually received on the  contract and retained by the vendor plus the fair market value at the  time of repossession of fixed improvements placed on the property by the  purchaser, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of the profits previously returned as income in  connection therewith and an amount representing what would have been a  proper adjustment for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence,  amortization, and depletion of the property during the period the  property was in the hands of the purchaser had the sale not been made,  will constitute gain or loss, as the case may be, to the vendor for the  year in which the property is repossessed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Basis of repossessed property. The basis of the property  described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph in the hands of the  vendor will be the original basis at the time of the sale plus the fair  market value at the time of repossession of fixed improvements placed on  the property by the purchaser, except that, with respect to  repossessions occurring after September 18, 1958, the basis of the  property shall be reduced by what would have been a proper adjustment  for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion  of the property during the period the property was in the hands of the  purchaser if the sale had not been made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reacquisition of property where title is transferred to  purchaser--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gain or loss on reacquisition. If the vendor in sales  described in paragraph (a) of this section has previously transferred  title to the purchaser, and the purchaser defaults in any of his  payments, and the vendor accepts a voluntary reconveyance of the  property, in partial or full satisfaction of the unpaid portion of the  purchase price, the receipt of the property so reacquired, to the extent  of its fair market value at that time, including the fair market value  of fixed improvements placed on the property by the purchaser, shall be  considered as the receipt of payment on the obligations satisfied. If  the fair market value of the property is greater than the basis of the  obligations of the purchaser so satisfied (generally, such basis being  the fair market value of such obligations previously recognized in  computing income), the excess constitutes ordinary income. If the value  of such property is less than the basis of such obligations, the  difference may be deducted as a bad debt if uncollectible, except that,  if the obligations satisfied are securities (as defined in section  165(g)(2)(C)), any gain or loss resulting from the transaction is a  capital gain or loss subject to the provisions of sections 1201 through  1241.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Basis of reacquired property. If the reacquired property  described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is subsequently sold,  the basis for determining gain or loss is the fair market value of the  property at the date of reacquisition, including the fair market value  of the fixed improvements placed on the property by the purchaser. See   section 166 and the regulations thereunder with respect to property  reacquired by the vendor in a foreclosure proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall  apply only with respect to taxable years beginning before September 3,  1964, in respect of which an election has not been properly made to have  the provisions of section 1038 apply. For rules applicable to taxable  years beginning after September 2, 1964, and for taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1957, to which such an election applies, see section  1038, and Secs. 1.1038-1 through 1.1038-3.
