To be determined eligible for an  appointment as a DOJ COTR, the following standards must be met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The candidate must attend and successfully complete a minimum of  a 16-hour basic COTR course; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The candidate must attend a minimum of 1 hour training  specifically in procurement ethics, either through courses offered  periodically by the Department, the bureaus, or a Government or  commercial vendor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitations. Each COTR appointment made by the contracting  officer shall clearly state that the representative is not an authorized  contracting officer and does not have the authority under any  circumstances to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Award, agree to award, or execute any contract, contract  modification, notice of intent, or other form of binding agreement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Obligate, in any manner, the payment of money by the Government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Make a final decision on any contract matter which is subject to  the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Terminate, suspend, or otherwise interfere with the contractor's  right to proceed, or direct any changes in the contractor's performance  that are inconsistent with or materially change the contract  specifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Termination.
