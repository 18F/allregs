Covers for holes in floors, roofs, and other walking/working surfaces shall meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Covers located in roadways and vehicular aisles shall be capable of supporting, without failure, at least twice the maximum axle load of the largest vehicle expected to cross over the cover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All other covers shall be capable of supporting, without failure, at least twice the weight of employees, equipment, and materials that may be imposed on the cover at any one time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All covers shall be secured when installed so as to prevent accidental displacement by the wind, equipment, or employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All covers shall be color coded or they shall be marked with the word ``HOLE'' or ``COVER'' to provide warning of the hazard.</p><p class="depth0">Note: This provision does not apply to cast iron manhole covers or steel grates used on streets or roadways.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Protection from falling objects. Falling object protection shall comply with the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Toeboards, when used as falling object protection, shall be erected along the edge of the overhead walking/working surface for a distance sufficient to protect employees below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Toeboards shall be capable of withstanding, without failure, a force of at least 50 pounds (222 N) applied in any downward or outward direction at any point along the toeboard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Toeboards shall be a minimum of 3\1/2\ inches (9 cm) in vertical height from their top edge to the level of the walking/working surface. They shall have not more than \1/4\ inch (0.6 cm) clearance above the walking/working surface. They shall be solid or have openings not over 1 inch (2.5 cm) in greatest dimension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where tools, equipment, or materials are piled higher than the top edge of a toeboard, paneling or screening shall be erected from the walking/working surface or toeboard to the top of a guardrail system's top rail or midrail, for a distance sufficient to protect employees below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Guardrail systems, when used as falling object protection, shall have all openings small enough to prevent passage of potential falling objects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> During the performance of overhand bricklaying and related work:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No materials or equipment except masonry and mortar shall be stored within 4 feet (1.2 m) of the working edge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Excess mortar, broken or scattered masonry units, and all other materials and debris shall be kept clear from the work area by removal at regular intervals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> During the performance of roofing work:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Materials and equipment shall not be stored within 6 feet (1.8 m) of a roof edge unless guardrails are erected at the edge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Materials which are piled, grouped, or stacked near a roof edge shall be stable and self-supporting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Canopies, when used as falling object protection, shall be strong enough to prevent collapse and to prevent penetration by any objects which may fall onto the canopy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Fall protection plan. This option is available only to employees engaged in leading edge work, precast concrete erection work, or residential construction work (See Sec. 1926.501(b)(2), (b)(12), and (b)(13)) who can demonstrate that it is infeasible or it creates a greater hazard to use conventional fall protection equipment. The fall protection plan must conform to the following provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The fall protection plan shall be prepared by a qualified person and developed specifically for the site where the leading edge work, precast concrete work, or residential construction work is being performed and the plan must be maintained up to date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any changes to the fall protection plan shall be approved by a qualified person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A copy of the fall protection plan with all approved changes shall be maintained at the job site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The implementation of the fall protection plan shall be under the supervision of a competent person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The fall protection plan shall document the reasons why the use of conventional fall protection systems (guardrail systems, personal fall arrest systems, or safety nets systems) are infeasible or why their use would create a greater hazard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The fall protection plan shall include a written discussion of other measures that will be taken to reduce or eliminate the fall hazard for workers who cannot be provided with protection from the conventional fall protection systems. For example, the employer shall discuss the extent to which scaffolds, ladders, or vehicle mounted work platforms can be used to provide a safer working surface and thereby reduce the hazard of falling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The fall protection plan shall identify each location where conventional fall protection methods cannot be used. These locations shall then be classified as controlled access zones and the employer must comply with the criteria in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Where no other alternative measure has been implemented, the employer shall implement a safety monitoring system in conformance with Sec. 1926.502(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The fall protection plan must include a statement which provides the name or other method of identification for each employee who is designated to work in controlled access zones. No other employees may enter controlled access zones.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> In the event an employee falls, or some other related, serious incident occurs, (e.g., a near miss) the employer shall investigate the circumstances of the fall or other incident to determine if the fall protection plan needs to be changed (e.g. new practices, procedures, or training) and shall implement those changes to prevent similar types of falls or incidents.</p>
