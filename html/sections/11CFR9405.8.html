                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person who has been notified under Sec. 9405.7(i) that his/her request for inspection of a record or for a copy of a record has been denied, or who has received no response within 20 working days (or within such extended period as is permitted under Sec. 9405.7(d)) after the request has been received by the Commission, or who has received no response within 20 days after a request for expedited processing has been received by the Commission, may appeal the adverse determination or the failure to respond by requesting the Commission to direct that the record be made available or that the expedited processing shall occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The appeal request shall be in writing, shall clearly and prominently state on the envelope or other cover and at the top of the first page ``FOIA Appeal,'' and shall identify the record in the form in which it was originally requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The appeal request should be delivered or addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer, U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1225 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 1100, Washington, DC 20005.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The requester may state facts and cite legal or other authorities as he or she deems appropriate in support of the appeal request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Commission will make a determination with respect to any appeal within 20 working days after receipt of the appeal (or within such extended period as is permitted under Sec. 9405.7). If, on appeal, the denial of the request for a record or a copy is in whole or in part upheld, the Commission shall advise the requester of the denial and shall notify him or her of the provisions for judicial review of that determination as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Because of the risk of misunderstanding inherent in oral communications, the Commission will not entertain any appeal from an alleged denial or failure to comply with an oral request. Any person who has orally requested a copy of a record that he or she believes to have been improperly denied should resubmit the request in writing as set forth in Sec. 9405.7.</p>
