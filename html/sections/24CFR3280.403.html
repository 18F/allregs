This section establishes the requirements for prime  windows and sliding glass doors, except that windows used in an entry  door are components of the door and are excluded from these  requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Standard. All primary windows and sliding glass doors shall  comply with AAMA 1701.2-95, Voluntary Standard Primary Window and  Sliding Glass Door for Utilization in Manufactured Housing, except the  exterior and interior pressure tests must be conducted at the design  wind loads required for components and cladding specified in Sec.  3280.305(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All skylights must comply with AAMA/WDMA/CSA/101/I.S.2/A440-08:  North American Fenestration Standard/Specifications for Windows, Doors  and Skylights (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 3280.4). Skylights  must withstand the roof loads for the applicable Roof Load Zone  specified in Sec. 3280.305(c)(3), and the following wind loads:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Installation. All primary windows, sliding glass doors, and  skylights must be installed in a manner that allows proper operation and  provides protection against the elements, as required by Sec. 3280.307.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Glass. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Safety glazing materials, where used shall meet  Standard for Safety Glazing Materials used in Buildings--Safety  Performance Specifications and Methods of Test, ANSI Z97.1-2004  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 3280.4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sealed insulating glass, where used, must meet all performance  requirements for Class C in accordance with ASTM E 774-97, Standard  Specification for the Classification of the Durability of Sealed  Insulating Glass Units. The sealing system must be qualified in  accordance with ASTM E 773-97, Standard Test Methods for Accelerated  Weathering of Sealed Insulating Glass Units. Each glass unit must be  permanently identified with the name of the insulating glass  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certification. All primary windows and sliding glass doors to be  installed in manufactured homes must be certified as complying with AAMA  1701.2-95. This certification must be based on tests conducted at the  design wind loads specified in Sec. 3280.305(c)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All such windows and doors must show evidence of certification  by affixing a quality certification label to the product in accordance  with ANSI Z34.1-1993, Third-Party Certification Programs for Products,  Processes, and Services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining certifiability of the products, an independent  quality assurance agency shall conduct pre-production specimen tests in  accordance with AAMA 1701.2-95. Further, such agency must inspect the  product manufacturer's facility at least twice per year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All skylights installed in manufactured homes must be certified  as complying with AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440-08: North American  Fenestration Standard/Specifications for Windows, Doors, and Skylights  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 3280.4). This certification must  be based on applicable loads specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Protection of primary window and sliding glass door openings in  high wind areas. For homes designed to be located in Wind Zones II and  III, manufacturers shall design exterior walls surrounding the primary  window and sliding glass door openings to allow for the installation of  shutters or other protective covers, such as plywood, to cover these  openings. Although not required, the Department encourages manufacturers  to provide the shutters or protective covers and to install receiving  devices, sleeves, or anchors for   fasteners to be used to secure the shutters or protective covers to the  exterior walls. If the manufacturer does not provide shutters or other  protective covers to cover these openings, the manufacturer must provide  to the homeowner instructions for at least one method of protecting  primary window and sliding glass door openings. This method must be  capable of resisting the design wind pressures specified in Sec.  3280.305 without taking the home out of conformance with the standards  in this part. These instructions must be included in the printed  instructions that accompany each manufactured home. The instructions  shall also indicate whether receiving devices, sleeves, or anchors, for  fasteners to be used to secure the shutters or protective covers to the  exterior walls, have been installed or provided by the manufacturer.
