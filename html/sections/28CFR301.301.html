                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No compensation for work-related injuries resulting in physical  impairment shall be paid prior to an inmate's release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compensation may only be paid for work-related injuries or  claims alleging improper medical treatment of a work-related injury.  This ordinarily includes only those injuries suffered during the  performance of an inmate's regular work assignment. However, injuries  suffered during the performance of voluntary work in the operation or  maintenance of the institution, when such work has been approved by  staff, may also be compensable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compensation is not paid for injuries sustained during  participation in institutional programs (such as programs of a social,  recreational, or community relations nature) or from maintenance of  one's own living quarters. Furthermore, compensation shall not be paid  for injuries suffered away from the work location (e.g., while the  claimant is going to or leaving work, or going to or coming from lunch  outside of the work station or area).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Injuries sustained by inmate workers willfully or with intent to  injure someone else, or injuries suffered in any activity not related to  the actual performance of the work assignment are not compensable, and  no claim for compensation for such injuries will be approved. Willful  violation of rules and regulations may result in denial of compensation  for any resulting injury.</p>
