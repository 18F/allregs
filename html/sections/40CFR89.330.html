                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Lubricating oil. Use the engine lubricating oil for testing that meets the requirements as specified by the manufacturer for a particular engine and intended usage. Record the specifications of the lubricating oil used for the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Test fuels. (1) Use diesel fuels for testing which are clean and bright, with pour and cloud points adequate for operability. The diesel fuel may contain nonmetallic additives as follows: Cetane improver, metal deactivator, antioxidant, dehazer, antirust, pour depressant, dye, dispersant, and biocide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use petroleum fuel meeting the specifications in Table 4 in Appendix A of this subpart, or substantially equivalent specifications approved by the Administrator, for exhaust emission testing. The grade of diesel fuel used must be commercially designated as ``Type 2-D'' grade diesel fuel and recommended by the engine manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Testing of Tier 1 and Tier 2 engines rated under 37 kW and Tier 2 and Tier 3 engines rated at or above 37 kW that is conducted by the Administrator shall be performed using test fuels that meet the specifications in Table 4 in Appendix A of this subpart and that have a sulfur content no higher than 0.20 weight percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other fuels may be used for testing provided they meet the following qualifications:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> They are commercially available;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Information acceptable to the Administrator is provided to show that only the designated fuel would be used in customer service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use of a fuel listed under paragraph (b) of this section would have a detrimental effect on emissions or durability; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fuel specifications are approved in writing by the Administrator prior to the start of testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Report the specification range of the fuel to be used under paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section in the application for certification in accordance with Sec. 89.115 (a)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Low-sulfur test fuel. (1) Upon request, for engines rated at or above 75 kW in model years 2006 or 2007, the diesel test fuel may be the low-sulfur diesel test fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065, subject to the provisions of this paragraph (e)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To use this option, the manufacturer must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Ensure that ultimate purchasers of equipment using these engines are informed that the use of fuel meeting the 500 ppm specification is recommended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Recommend to equipment manufacturers that a label be applied at the fuel inlet recommending 500 ppm fuel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> None of the engines in the engine family may employ sulfur-sensitive technologies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For engines rated at or above 130 kW, this option may be used in 2006 and 2007. For engines rated at or above 75 kW and under 130 kW, this option may be used only in 2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For model years 2008 through 2010, except as otherwise provided, the diesel test fuel shall be the low-sulfur diesel test fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The diesel test fuel shall be the ultra low-sulfur diesel test fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065 for model years 2011 and later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For model years 2007 through 2010 engines that use sulfur-sensitive emission-control technology, the diesel test fuel is the ultra low-sulfur fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065 if the manufacturer demonstrates that the in-use engines will use only fuel with 15 ppm or less of sulfur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Instead of the test fuels described in paragraphs (e)(2) through (4) of this section, for model years 2008 and later, manufacturers may use the test fuel described in appendix A of this subpart. In such cases, the test fuel described in appendix A of this subpart shall be the test fuel for all manufacturer and EPA testing.
