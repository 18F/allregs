Appendix A to Subpart P of Part 1926--Soil Classification</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope and application--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope. This appendix describes a  method of classifying soil and rock deposits based on site and  environmental conditions, and on the structure and composition of the  earth deposits. The appendix contains definitions, sets forth  requirements, and describes acceptable visual and manual tests for use  in classifying soils.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> as a method of protection for employees from cave- ins. This appendix also applies when timber shoring for excavations is  designed as a method of protection from cave-ins in accordance with  appendix C to subpart P of part 1926, and when aluminum hydraulic  shoring is designed in accordance with appendix D. This appendix also  applies if other protective systems are designed and selected for use  from data prepared in accordance with the requirements set forth in  Sec. 1926.652(c), and the use of the data is predicated on the use of  the soil classification system set forth in this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The definitions and examples given below are based  on, in whole or in part, the following: American Society for Testing  Materials (ASTM) Standards D653-85 and D2488; The Unified Soils  Classification System, The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  Textural Classification Scheme; and The National Bureau of Standards  Report BSS-121.</p><p class="depth0">Cemented soil means a soil in which the particles are held together  by a chemical agent, such as calcium carbonate, such that a hand-size  sample cannot be crushed into powder or individual soil particles by  finger pressure.</p><p class="depth0">Cohesive soil means clay (fine grained soil), or soil with a high  clay content, which has cohesive strength. Cohesive soil does not  crumble, can be excavated with vertical sideslopes, and is plastic when  moist. Cohesive soil is hard to break up when dry, and exhibits  significant cohesion when submerged. Cohesive soils include clayey silt,  sandy clay, silty clay, clay and organic clay.</p><p class="depth0">Dry soil means soil that does not exhibit visible signs of moisture  content.</p><p class="depth0">Fissured means a soil material that has a tendency to break along  definite planes of fracture with little resistance, or a material that  exhibits open cracks, such as tension cracks, in an exposed surface.</p><p class="depth0">Granular soil means gravel, sand, or silt, (coarse grained soil)  with little or no clay content. Granular soil has no cohesive strength.  Some moist granular soils exhibit apparent cohesion. Granular soil  cannot be molded when moist and crumbles easily when dry.</p><p class="depth0">Layered system means two or more distinctly different soil or rock  types arranged in layers. Micaceous seams or weakened planes in rock or  shale are considered layered.</p><p class="depth0">Moist soil means a condition in which a soil looks and feels damp.  Moist cohesive soil can easily be shaped into a ball and rolled into  small diameter threads before crumbling. Moist granular soil that  contains some cohesive material will exhibit signs of cohesion between  particles.</p><p class="depth0">Plastic means a property of a soil which allows the soil to be  deformed or molded without cracking, or appreciable volume change.</p><p class="depth0">Saturated soil means a soil in which the voids are filled with  water. Saturation does not require flow. Saturation, or near saturation,  is necessary for the proper use of instruments such as a pocket  penetrometer or sheer vane.</p><p class="depth0">Soil classification system means, for the purpose of this subpart, a  method of categorizing soil and rock deposits in a hierarchy of Stable  Rock, Type A, Type B, and Type C, in decreasing order of stability. The  categories are determined based on an analysis of the properties and  performance characteristics of the deposits and the environmental  conditions of exposure.</p><p class="depth0">Stable rock means natural solid mineral matter that can be excavated  with vertical sides and remain intact while exposed.</p><p class="depth0">Submerged soil means soil which is underwater or is free seeping.</p><p class="depth0">Type A means cohesive soils with an unconfined compressive strength  of 1.5 ton per square foot (tsf) (144 kPa) or greater. Examples of  cohesive soils are: clay, silty clay, sandy clay, clay loam and, in some  cases, silty clay loam and sandy clay loam. Cemented soils such as  caliche and hardpan are also considered Type A. However, no soil is Type  A if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The soil is fissured; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The soil is subject to vibration from heavy traffic, pile  driving, or similar effects; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The soil has been previously disturbed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The soil is part of a sloped, layered system where the layers  dip into the excavation on a slope of four horizontal to one vertical  (4H:1V) or greater; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The material is subject to other factors that would require it  to be classified as a less stable material.</p><p class="depth0">Type B means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cohesive soil with an unconfined compressive strength greater  than 0.5 tsf (48 kPa) but less than 1.5 tsf (144 kPa); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Granular cohesionless soils including: angular gravel (similar  to crushed rock),   silt, silt loam, sandy loam and, in some cases, silty clay loam and  sandy clay loam.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Previously disturbed soils except those which would otherwise  be classed as Type C soil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Soil that meets the unconfined compressive strength or  cementation requirements for Type A, but is fissured or subject to  vibration; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Dry rock that is not stable; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Material that is part of a sloped, layered system where the  layers dip into the excavation on a slope less steep than four  horizontal to one vertical (4H:1V), but only if the material would  otherwise be classified as Type B.</p><p class="depth0">Type C means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cohesive soil with an unconfined compressive strength of 0.5 tsf  (48 kPa) or less; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Granular soils including gravel, sand, and loamy sand; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Submerged soil or soil from which water is freely seeping; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Submerged rock that is not stable, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Material in a sloped, layered system where the layers dip into  the excavation or a slope of four horizontal to one vertical (4H:1V) or  steeper.</p><p class="depth0">Unconfined compressive strength means the load per unit area at  which a soil will fail in compression. It can be determined by  laboratory testing, or estimated in the field using a pocket  penetrometer, by thumb penetration tests, and other methods.</p><p class="depth0">Wet soil means soil that contains significantly more moisture than  moist soil, but in such a range of values that cohesive material will  slump or begin to flow when vibrated. Granular material that would  exhibit cohesive properties when moist will lose those cohesive  properties when wet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Classification of soil and rock deposits. Each  soil and rock deposit shall be classified by a competent person as  Stable Rock, Type A, Type B, or Type C in accordance with the  definitions set forth in paragraph (b) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Basis of classification. The classification of the deposits  shall be made based on the results of at least one visual and at least  one manual analysis. Such analyses shall be conducted by a competent  person using tests described in paragraph (d) below, or in other  recognized methods of soil classification and testing such as those  adopted by the America Society for Testing Materials, or the U.S.  Department of Agriculture textural classification system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Visual and manual analyses. The visual and manual analyses, such  as those noted as being acceptable in paragraph (d) of this appendix,  shall be designed and conducted to provide sufficient quantitative and  qualitative information as may be necessary to identify properly the  properties, factors, and conditions affecting the classification of the  deposits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Layered systems. In a layered system, the system shall be  classified in accordance with its weakest layer. However, each layer may  be classified individually where a more stable layer lies under a less  stable layer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reclassification. If, after classifying a deposit, the  properties, factors, or conditions affecting its classification change  in any way, the changes shall be evaluated by a competent person. The  deposit shall be reclassified as necessary to reflect the changed  circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Acceptable visual and manual tests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Visual tests. Visual  analysis is conducted to determine qualitative information regarding the  excavation site in general, the soil adjacent to the excavation, the  soil forming the sides of the open excavation, and the soil taken as  samples from excavated material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Observe samples of soil that are excavated and soil in the sides  of the excavation. Estimate the range of particle sizes and the relative  amounts of the particle sizes. Soil that is primarily composed of fine- grained material is cohesive material. Soil composed primarily of  coarse-grained sand or gravel is granular material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Observe soil as it is excavated. Soil that remains in clumps  when excavated is cohesive. Soil that breaks up easily and does not stay  in clumps is granular.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Observe the side of the opened excavation and the surface area  adjacent to the excavation. Crack-like openings such as tension cracks  could indicate fissured material. If chunks of soil spall off a vertical  side, the soil could be fissured. Small spalls are evidence of moving  ground and are indications of potentially hazardous situations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Observe the area adjacent to the excavation and the excavation  itself for evidence of existing utility and other underground  structures, and to identify previously disturbed soil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Observe the opened side of the excavation to identify layered  systems. Examine layered systems to identify if the layers slope toward  the excavation. Estimate the degree of slope of the layers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Observe the area adjacent to the excavation and the sides of  the opened excavation for evidence of surface water, water seeping from  the sides of the excavation, or the location of the level of the water  table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Observe the area adjacent to the excavation and the area  within the excavation for sources of vibration that may affect the  stability of the excavation face.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manual tests. Manual analysis of soil samples is conducted to  determine quantitative as well as qualitative properties of soil and to  provide more information in order to classify soil properly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Plasticity. Mold a moist or wet sample of soil into a ball and  attempt to roll it into threads as thin as \1/8\-inch in diameter.  Cohesive material can be successfully rolled into   threads without crumbling. For example, if at least a two inch (50 mm)  length of \1/8\-inch thread can be held on one end without tearing, the  soil is cohesive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dry strength. If the soil is dry and crumbles on its own or  with moderate pressure into individual grains or fine powder, it is  granular (any combination of gravel, sand, or silt). If the soil is dry  and falls into clumps which break up into smaller clumps, but the  smaller clumps can only be broken up with difficulty, it may be clay in  any combination with gravel, sand or silt. If the dry soil breaks into  clumps which do not break up into small clumps and which can only be  broken with difficulty, and there is no visual indication the soil is  fissured, the soil may be considered unfissured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Thumb penetration. The thumb penetration test can be used to  estimate the unconfined compressive strength of cohesive soils. (This  test is based on the thumb penetration test described in American  Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard designation D2488-- ``Standard Recommended Practice for Description of Soils (Visual--Manual  Procedure).'') Type A soils with an unconfined compressive strength of  1.5 tsf can be readily indented by the thumb; however, they can be  penetrated by the thumb only with very great effort. Type C soils with  an unconfined compressive strength of 0.5 tsf can be easily penetrated  several inches by the thumb, and can be molded by light finger pressure.  This test should be conducted on an undisturbed soil sample, such as a  large clump of spoil, as soon as practicable after excavation to keep to  a miminum the effects of exposure to drying influences. If the  excavation is later exposed to wetting influences (rain, flooding), the  classification of the soil must be changed accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other strength tests. Estimates of unconfined compressive  strength of soils can also be obtained by use of a pocket penetrometer  or by using a hand-operated shearvane.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Drying test. The basic purpose of the drying test is to  differentiate between cohesive material with fissures, unfissured  cohesive material, and granular material. The procedure for the drying  test involves drying a sample of soil that is approximately one inch  thick (2.54 cm) and six inches (15.24 cm) in diameter until it is  thoroughly dry:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the sample develops cracks as it dries, significant fissures  are indicated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Samples that dry without cracking are to be broken by hand. If  considerable force is necessary to break a sample, the soil has  significant cohesive material content. The soil can be classified as a  unfissured cohesive material and the unconfined compressive strength  should be determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a sample breaks easily by hand, it is either a fissured  cohesive material or a granular material. To distinguish between the  two, pulverize the dried clumps of the sample by hand or by stepping on  them. If the clumps do not pulverize easily, the material is cohesive  with fissures. If they pulverize easily into very small fragments, the  material is granular.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix B to Subpart P of Part 1926--Sloping and Benching</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope and application. This appendix contains specifications for  sloping and benching when used as methods of protecting employees  working in excavations from cave-ins. The requirements of this appendix  apply when the design of sloping and benching protective systems is to  be performed in accordance with the requirements set forth in Sec.  1926.652(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">Actual slope means the slope to which an excavation face is  excavated.</p><p class="depth0">Distress means that the soil is in a condition where a cave-in is  imminent or is likely to occur. Distress is evidenced by such phenomena  as the development of fissures in the face of or adjacent to an open  excavation; the subsidence of the edge of an excavation; the slumping of  material from the face or the bulging or heaving of material from the  bottom of an excavation; the spalling of material from the face of an  excavation; and ravelling, i.e., small amounts of material such as  pebbles or little clumps of material suddenly separating from the face  of an excavation and trickling or rolling down into the excavation.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum allowable slope means the steepest incline of an excavation  face that is acceptable for the most favorable site conditions as  protection against cave-ins, and is expressed as the ratio of horizontal  distance to vertical rise (H:V).</p><p class="depth0">Short term exposure means a period of time less than or equal to 24  hours that an excavation is open.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Soil classification. Soil and rock deposits  shall be classified in accordance with appendix A to subpart P of part  1926.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maximum allowable slope. The maximum allowable slope for a soil  or rock deposit shall be determined from Table B-1 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Actual slope. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The actual slope shall not be steeper than the  maximum allowable slope.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The actual slope shall be less steep than the maximum allowable  slope, when there are signs of distress. If that situation occurs, the  slope shall be cut back to an actual slope which is at least \1/2\  horizontal to one vertical (\1/2\H:1V) less steep than the maximum  allowable slope.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When surcharge loads from stored material or equipment,  operating equipment, or traffic are present, a competent person shall   determine the degree to which the actual slope must be reduced below the  maximum allowable slope, and shall assure that such reduction is  achieved. Surcharge loads from adjacent structures shall be evaluated in  accordance with Sec. 1926.651(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Configurations.

This appendix contains information that can be used  timber shoring is provided as a method of protection from cave-ins in  trenches that do not exceed 20 feet (6.1 m) in depth. This appendix must  be used when design of timber shoring protective systems is to be  performed in accordance with Sec. 1926.652(c)(1). Other timber shoring  configurations; other systems of support such as hydraulic and pneumatic  systems; and other protective systems such as sloping, benching,  shielding, and freezing systems must be designed in accordance with the  requirements set forth in Sec. 1926.652(b) and Sec. 1926.652(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Soil Classification. In order to use the data presented in this  appendix, the soil type or types in which the excavation is made must  first be determined using the soil classification method set forth in  appendix A of subpart P of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Presentation of Information. Information is presented in several  forms as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Information is presented in tabular form in Tables C-1.1, C-1.2,  and C-1.3, and Tables C-2.1, C-2.2 and C-2.3 following paragraph (g) of  the appendix. Each table presents the minimum sizes of timber members to  use in a shoring system, and each table contains data only for the  particular soil type in which the excavation or portion of   the excavation is made. The data are arranged to allow the user the  flexibility to select from among several acceptable configurations of  members based on varying the horizontal spacing of the crossbraces.  Stable rock is exempt from shoring requirements and therefore, no data  are presented for this condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Information concerning the basis of the tabular data and the  limitations of the data is presented in paragraph (d) of this appendix,  and on the tables themselves.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Information explaining the use of the tabular data is presented  in paragraph (e) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Information illustrating the use of the tabular data is  presented in paragraph (f) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Miscellaneous notations regarding Tables C-1.1 through C-1.3 and  Tables C-2.1 through C-2.3 are presented in paragraph (g) of this  Appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Basis and limitations of the data--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Dimensions of timber  members. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sizes of the timber members listed in Tables C-1.1  through C-1.3 are taken from the National Bureau of Standards (NBS)  report, ``Recommended Technical Provisions for Construction Practice in  Shoring and Sloping of Trenches and Excavations.'' In addition, where  NBS did not recommend specific sizes of members, member sizes are based  on an analysis of the sizes required for use by existing codes and on  empirical practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The required dimensions of the members listed in Tables C-1.1  through C-1.3 refer to actual dimensions and not nominal dimensions of  the timber. Employers wanting to use nominal size shoring are directed  to Tables C-2.1 through C-2.3, or have this choice under Sec.  1926.652(c)(3), and are referred to The Corps of Engineers, The Bureau  of Reclamation or data from other acceptable sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitation of application. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is not intended that the  timber shoring specification apply to every situation that may be  experienced in the field. These data were developed to apply to the  situations that are most commonly experienced in current trenching  practice. Shoring systems for use in situations that are not covered by  the data in this appendix must be designed as specified in Sec.  1926.652(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When any of the following conditions are present, the members  specified in the tables are not considered adequate. Either an alternate  timber shoring system must be designed or another type of protective  system designed in accordance with Sec. 1926.652.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> When loads imposed by structures or by stored material adjacent  to the trench weigh in excess of the load imposed by a two-foot soil  surcharge.

The members of the shoring system that are to be  selected using this information are the cross braces, the uprights, and  the wales, where wales are required. Minimum sizes of members are  specified for use in different types of soil. There are six tables of  information, two for each soil type. The soil type must first be  determined in accordance with the soil classification system described  in appendix A to subpart P of part 1926. Using the appropriate table,  the selection of the size and spacing of the members is then made. The  selection is based on the depth and width of the trench where the  members are to be installed and, in most instances, the selection is  also based on the horizontal spacing of the crossbraces. Instances where  a choice of horizontal spacing of crossbracing is available, the  horizontal spacing of the crossbraces must be chosen by the user before  the size of any member can be determined. When the soil type, the width  and depth of the trench, and the horizontal spacing of the crossbraces  are known, the size and vertical spacing of the crossbraces, the size  and vertical spacing of the wales, and the size and horizontal spacing  of the uprights can be read from the appropriate table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples to Illustrate the Use of Tables C-1.1 through C-1.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Example 1.</p><p class="depth0">A trench dug in Type A soil is 13 feet deep and five feet wide.</p><p class="depth0">From Table C-1.1, for acceptable arrangements of timber can be used.</p><p class="depth0">Arrangement B1</p><p class="depth0">Space 4x4 crossbraces at six feet horizontally and four feet  vertically.</p><p class="depth0">Wales are not required.</p><p class="depth0">Space 3x8 uprights at six feet horizontally.

The members of the  shoring system that are to be selected using this information are the  hydraulic cylinders, and either the vertical shores or the horizontal  wales. When a waler system is used the vertical timber sheeting to be  used is also selected from these tables. The Tables D-1.1 and D-1.2 for  vertical shores are used in Type A and B soils that do not require  sheeting. Type B soils that may require sheeting, and Type C soils that  always require sheeting are found in the horizontal wale Tables D-1.3  and D-1.4. The soil type must first be determined in accordance with the  soil classification system described in appendix A to subpart P of part  1926. Using the appropriate table, the selection of the size and spacing  of the members is made. The selection is based on the depth and width of  the trench where the members are to be installed. In these tables the  vertical spacing is held constant at four feet on center. The tables  show the maximum horizontal spacing of cylinders allowed for each size  of wale in the waler system tables, and in the vertical shore tables,  the hydraulic cylinder horizontal spacing is the same as the vertical  shore spacing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Example to Illustrate the Use of the Tables:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Example 1:</p><p class="depth0">A trench dug in Type A soil is 6 feet deep and 3 feet wide.
