                                Sec. 1650.17  Changes and cancellation of a withdrawal request.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before processing. A pending withdrawal request can be cancelled  if the cancellation is processed before the TSP processes the withdrawal  request. However, the TSP processes withdrawal requests each business  day and those that are entered into the record keeping system by 12:00  noon eastern time will ordinarily be processed that night; those entered  after 12:00 noon eastern time will be processed the next business day.  Consequently, a cancellation request must be received and entered into  the system before the cut-off for the day the withdrawal request is  submitted for processing in order to be effective to cancel the  withdrawal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After processing. A withdrawal election cannot be changed or  cancelled after the withdrawal request has been processed. Consequently,  funds disbursed cannot be returned to the TSP record keeper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Change in monthly payments. If a participant is receiving a  series of monthly payments, the participant can change at any time: His  or her withdrawal election to request a final single payment, the  address to which the payments are mailed, whether or not a   payment will be transferred (if permitted) and the portion to be  transferred, the method by which direct payments to the participant are  being sent (EFT or check), the identity of the financial institution to  which payments are transferred or sent by EFT, or the identity of the  EFT account. Once a year, during a period determined by the Executive  Director, the participant may also elect to change the payment amount or  to change from a monthly payment based on life expectancy to a fixed  payment amount.
