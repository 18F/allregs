                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If it has been determined that acquisition of a tract cannot be accomplished by purchase due to failure to reach an agreement with the owners as to value, inability to contact the owners, title defects, or for other reasons, acquisition will be completed by the filing of a declaration of taking in a condemnation proceeding and the concurrent deposit of the estimated compensation in the registry of the court. The requirements for a declaration of taking are set forth in 40 U.S.C. 258a.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Declaration of taking assembly. The assembly to be submitted by the Division or District Engineer to the Chief of Engineers, with a recommendation for the filing of a declaration of taking, will contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Seven copies of the declaration of taking. (Reproduced copies will be accepted if clear and legible). The copy to be executed and filed in court must be free of errors and erasures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Seven copies of tract descriptions and names and addresses of purported owners, identified as Schedule ``A'' to the declaration of taking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Seven copies of a segment or project map, showing the individual tracts outlined in red, or shaded in such a way as to identify them, constituting Schedule ``B'' to the declaration of taking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In acquisitions for Air Force and other agencies, one additional copy of each of the above is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> As to tracts which are appraised at $50,000 or more, it is necessary to have a least two appraisals for each such tract in condemnation. One copy of each appraisal will be forwarded with the assembly for those tracts valued less than $100,000, and two copies where the value is $100,000 or more. Also, a copy of the appraisal should be forwarded when there is a counteroffer of $50,000 or more, no matter what the appraisal is. In all cases where two appraisals are necessary, at least one will be by a contract appraiser approved in advance by the United States Attorney in whose jurisdiction the case will be filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Appraisals must be on a current basis so that at the time of submission of the assembly, the review certificates should indicate that the review has been made within thirty days prior to submission of the assembly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Guides in preparing declarations of taking for acquisitions for the Departments of the Army (Military and Civil) and Air Force are contained in Figure 5-5 in ER 405-1-12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Each case where there is an accepted Offer to Sell on which we will

ask the Department of Justice to obtain judgment should be submitted as a separate Declaration of Taking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Negotiator's report. Each declaration of taking assembly should be accompanied by a separate Negotiator's Report, ENG Form 3423 (Parts I and II), in duplicate, for each tract of land included in the assembly. The Negotiator's Report should be current, i.e., it should indicate a contact with the landowner, or his representative, at a time reasonably close to the date of submittal of the assembly, and should reflect that actual, practical and realistic negotiations were conducted in accordance with the procedure set forth in Sec. 644.83. The Negotiator's Report should be complete, but should be concise and not made unduly lengthy by extraneous material. It should contain so much of the following information as may be pertinent:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A brief physical description of the property, including its present use and highest and best use claimed by both the Government and the landowner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Number of discussions and date and place of each discussion, and a statement that the landowner was furnished a summary of the basis for the Government's valuation prior to negotiations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Statement of each offer made by the negotiator, any counteroffer received from the landowner, and any figures suggested by the negotiator in an effort to obtain a reasonable counteroffer above the Government's estimate of value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where the discussions reveal that further negotiations would not be productive, a statement that the real estate representative explained that it was necessary that the interests be obtained through condemnation, not in the sense of a threat, but as an effort on behalf of the Government to secure an impartial determination by the court of the differences of opinion as to value, and in order to make funds available to the landowner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the owner cannot be contacted for the purpose of conducting negotiations, a full explanation of the circumstances and the efforts made to contact the owner should be set forth in the Negotiator's Report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A statement that any remaining property of the owner enjoys access and is an economic unit, or if it is an uneconomic remainder, that the Government has offered to acquire the remainder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where there is an Offer to Sell, the Negotiator's Report should include a statement that no separate representations were made in order to obtain the offer, if this was the case. If any such representations were made, they should be fully explained. The report should also include the negotiator's telephone number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Letter of transmittal. The letter of transmittal to be submitted with a declaration of taking assembly will contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date of the real estate directive or the date of approval of the real estate design memorandum which includes the land to be condemned, a statement that the land is within the approved project boundary line, and the date of approval of the boundary line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement concerning the availability of funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A list of the dates of the appraisals of the tracts in the assembly and the dates of the last review thereof. If more than one approved appraisal exists for any tract, the deposit will be in the amount of the highest approved appraisal. If the value of growing crops has been included in the appraisal, a statement concerning same is required in the transmittal letter pursuant to paragraph (h)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement that all owners of land included in the assembly, whose addresses are known, have been notified in writing that condemnation will be recommended and the reason therefor. The information furnished to the owners should include the name and address of the United States Attorney who will advise and assist them in applying for withdrawal of the funds deposited in the registry of the court. The notice to the owners should also state the date on which possession of their property will be required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement concerning the date when possession of each tract included in the assembly should be obtained. This should include information as to when the 90-day notice was given, as

required by section 301(5) of Pub. L. 91-646 (84 Stat. 1894), or if not required, an explanation as to why not.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In assemblies involving other than civil works projects, a statement as to whether or not all of the land authorized in the real estate directive is included in the proposed declaration of taking. Any variance that may exist between the acreage in the directive and the acreage in the declaration of taking should be fully explained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For military projects, a statement of the expected local resistance to the proposed acquisition by condemnation, and the efforts which have been made to adjust requirements to the local situation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For those assemblies involving the first case in a particular project, information as to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the initial land acquisition for the project took place.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The total acreage for the project and the estimate of the cost thereof; if available, two copies of the project brochure furnished to landowners should be forwarded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether or not an environmental impact statement has been filed, and, if not, when it is expected to be filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Two copies of each accepted Offer to Sell covering any of the tracts included in the declaration of taking will be submitted with the assembly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A statement as to whether there have been any Congressional inquiries regarding the acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Title defects. If a tract is recommended for condemnation due to title defects, three copies of the title opinion will be submitted with the assembly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Deposit of funds. Two copies of the declaration of taking, as finally approved and signed, will be transmitted by the Chief of Engineers to the Division and District Engineer. Procurement and delivery of a check to the United States Attorney for deposit in the registry of the court will be authorized, subject to the availability of funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Additional information to accompany Air Force acquisitions. Each condemnation assembly (complaint or declaration of taking) covering the acquisition of land for an Air Force project will include the following information and material, in duplicate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A map showing the base boundaries, outlining in red all land included in the applicable real estate directive, and showing the land included in the condemnation assembly hachured in red. In the case of an off-base facility, the map will show the nearest boundary of the main base with relation to the off-base facility, outlining in red all land in the applicable real estate directive, with the land covered by the condemnation assembly hachured in red.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On the same map or a larger scale map, the following information on each tract in the applicable real estate directive:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tract number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Acreage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ownership.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Contours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Existing improvements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Proposed construction, including utilities, drainage ditches, and other supporting facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Summary of status of acquisition of all land included in the applicable real estate directive. ENG Form 3905-R will be used for this purpose. All discrepancies in figures for acreages and costs should be fully explained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If any of the land included in the applicable real estate directive is held under voluntary lease or leasehold condemnation, report for each such tract the annual rental, the period of time the leasehold interest has been held, and whether it is a voluntary lease or a condemnation leasehold. If the land is not under lease, this fact should be reported.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the United States has previously acquired an easement interest (clearance easement, safety area easement, etc.) in any of the land included in the condemnation assembly, identify the real estate directive which authorized the previous acquisition by number, date, interest acquired, acres, cost and method of acquisition (including lease number, tract number, caption with civil action number as applicable). A negative report is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If severance damage is involved in any of the land included in the condemnation assembly, include a detailed statement of the facts and justification

for the severance allowed, unless the severance damage has been adequately explained in a Real Estate Planning Report or a Real Estate Requirements Estimate, in which case such Report or Estimate should be identified for reference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A copy of the appraisal report on which the deposit in a declaration of taking is based, irrespective of value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Interests included in declaration of taking. (1) The estate recommended for use in a declaration of taking should conform to the estate approved by the Chief of Engineers in Civil Works projects and to the applicable directive in military and other agency projects. Any deviation should be fully explained and justified in the transmittal letter. Examples of estates which have been approved for use in declarations of taking are contained in Figure 5-6 in ER 405-1-12. A condemnation proceeding is an in rem action. The definition of ``property'' and what constitutes property is generally determined by reference to State law. Therefore, full consideration should be given to the applicable State law in connection with requests for deviations from the standard approved estates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The estate recommended for use in a declaration of taking should conform to the estate approved by the Chief of Engineers in Civil Works projects and to the applicable directive in military and other agency projects. Any deviation should be fully explained and justified in the transmittal letter. Examples of estates which have been approved for use in declarations of taking are contained in Figure 5-6 in ER 405-1-12. A condemnation proceeding is an in rem action. The definition of ``property'' and what constitutes property is generally determined by reference to State law. Therefore, full consideration should be given to the applicable State law in connection with requests for deviations from the standard approved estates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Normally, under the ``unit'' rule a condemnation proceeding should include all interests in a given tract authorized for acquisition even though an Offer to Sell may have been obtained and accepted from the surface owner with an outstanding interest in the subsurface estate recited in the ``Subject to'' paragraph. In such a case, if it is necessary to condemn due to title difficulties or failure of the owner to carry out the terms of the Offer to Sell, the deposit will be increased by the appraised value of the outstanding subsurface interest. The only exception to including subsurface interests outstanding in third parties is in the case of block ownership of subsurface interests; i.e., where a person, corporation, or other entity owns subsurface interests under more than one surface tract and in sufficient amount for the entire interest holding to have added value, for operational or other reasons, because it is in a block ownership. In other words, block ownership exists when the acquisition of a part of the block would require the assessment of severance damage, even if the value of the interest or the amount of the severance damage would be in a nominal amount. On this basis, subsurface interests need not be contiguous to constitute a block ownership.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If future negotiations to acquire or subordinate the subsurface interests left outstanding under paragraph (g)(2) of this section (or any non-block subsurface interests ``excepted'' from direct purchase cases) are unsuccessful, and the outstanding interest cannot be waived under the provisions of Sec. 644.86, then acquisition or subordination of the outstanding interest should be accomplished by condemnation proceedings. In so doing, block ownerships should be condemned as a unit rather than on a piecemeal basis. Full information should be submitted with such assemblies as to the method of acquisition of each surface ownership affected by the subsurface acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Payment for crops. At the time the declaration of taking assembly is prepared, it will be necessary that a determination be made as to whether the value of growing crops should be added to the value of the land improvements in determining the amount to be deposited as estimated compensation. The determination will be made as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the crops have been harvested, or it is known or highly probable that the crops will be harvested by the landowner or tenant, no deposit will be made for the crops.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The approved appraised value of crops will be included in the amounts to be deposited in all other cases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The letter forwarding the declaration of taking to the Chief of Engineers will state whether the value of growing crops has been included in the amount recommended for deposit, and will set forth a statement of the facts upon which the action is based.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Filing and possession. Upon the filing of a complaint, accompanied by a declaration of taking, the court has the power to fix the time within which and the terms upon which the parties in possession shall be required to surrender possession to the United States (40 U.S.C. 258a). Requests for orders of possession should be made only after all requirements of Pub. L. 91-646 (84

Stat. 1894) regarding possession have been satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Division or District Engineer will ascertain from the United States Attorney the date on which the condemnation proceeding with declaration of taking is filed and the date on which possession is available. The using service of the Army and Air Force or the local representative of other agencies will be informed of the date on which possession of the land is available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The above information, together with the civil number assigned to the case, and a copy of the complaint and order of possession will be furnished to HQDA (DAEN-REA-C) WASH DC 20314 within six weeks after the date the case was forwarded by the Chief of Engineers to the Department of Justice. If this cannot be accomplished, an explanation will be furnished by such date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where an Order of Possession is obtained but the landowner refuses to comply, it may be necessary to obtain a Writ of Assistance from the court. Prior to requesting the United States Attorney to obtain such a Writ, all pertinent facts should be reported to DAEN-REA-C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The United States Attorney should be requested to have judgment entered in accordance with the terms of any accepted Offers to Sell immediately after the filing of the case, since delay in taking such action works to the disadvantage of the Government. Any difficulty in securing prompt action by the United States Attorney in this matter should be reported to DAEN-REA-C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Amendments. (1) If at any time it becomes necessary to amend a complaint or declaration of taking previously filed, an amendment assembly will be submitted to DAEN-REA-C together with a full statement of the facts requiring the amendment. The letter of transmittal should certify that the tracts affected by the amendment have not been adjudicated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If at any time it becomes necessary to amend a complaint or declaration of taking previously filed, an amendment assembly will be submitted to DAEN-REA-C together with a full statement of the facts requiring the amendment. The letter of transmittal should certify that the tracts affected by the amendment have not been adjudicated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No amendment should be submitted which will result in a revestment of an interest in property, unless a stipulation for revestment has been obtained from the former owner in accordance with Sec. 644.115.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, after the filing of a declaration of taking, a substantially higher appraisal is approved for any reason, and a settlement does not appear imminent, an amendment will be submitted promptly to increase the amount of the deposit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Alternate form declaration of taking. An alternate form of Declaration of Taking has been approved by the Judicial Conference on an optional basis, and must be used where the local District Court requires. Under this form a Declaration of Taking may have up to 15 ownerships, but each ownership will be set up separately so that it may be included in a separate civil action. In other words, there may be up to 15 separate civil actions which are keyed in to one Declaration of Taking. An example of this type of Declaration is included in Figure 5-5 in ER 405-1-12. In this form, Schedule ``A'' will include the authority and public uses. Schedule ``B'' will include the description, the estimated compensation, and the estate to be acquired. Schedule ``C'' will be the plan showing the land to be acquired. It will be noted that there will be a separate Schedule ``A'', ``B'', and ``C'' for each ownership. The schedules may include more than one tract where the ownership is unified and is an economic unit. All of the civil actions will be keyed in to the Declaration of Taking by a Master File number. The Master File number must be used on all correspondence pertaining to tracts in this type of an assembly.</p>
