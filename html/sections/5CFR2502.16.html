                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general, all records of the Office of Administration are  available to the public, as required by the Freedom of Information Act.  However, the Office claims the right, where it is applicable, to  withhold material under the provisions specified in the Freedom of  Information Act as amended (5 U.S.C. 552(b)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records from Non-U.S. Government Source. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon receipt of a  request for a record that was obtained from a non-U.S. Government  source, or for a record containing information clearly identified as  having been provided by a non-U.S. Government source, including a  contract proposal or contract material, the Office will contact the  source of the requested record or information requesting advice as to  whether release of the record would adversely affect the source's  competitive position or invade anyone's privacy. Subsequent to receipt  of such advice, the Office will independently examine the requested  document and will notify the requester of the final decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OA personnel will generally consider two exemptions in the FOIA  in deciding whether to withhold from disclosure material from a non-U.S.  Government source. Exemption 4 permits withholding of ``trade secrets  and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and  privileged or confidential.'' Exemption 6 permits withholding certain  information, the disclosure of which ``would constitute a clearly  unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.'' The source whose material  has been requested will be asked to supply convincing justification for  any material it wishes withheld under the Act, in accordance with the  following general guidelines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For consideration under exemption 4, the supplier of the record  or information should identify material that would be likely to cause  substantial harm to its present or future competitive position if it  were released. If a contractor, the provider should assume that the  material will be released to a competitor, even if that is not always  the case. A contractor must provide detailed information on why release  would be harmful, e.g., the general custom or usage in the business; the  number and situation of the persons who have access to the information;  the type and degree of risk of financial injury that release would  cause; and the length of time the information will need to be kept  confidential.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In this respect, the Office of Administration will--as a general  rule--look favorably upon recommendations for withholding information  about   ideas, methods, and processes that are unique; about equipment,  materials, or systems that are potentially patentable; or about a unique  use of equipment which is specifically outlined.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> OA will not withhold information that is known through custom or  usage in the relevant trade, business, or profession, or information  that is generally known to any reasonably educated person. Self-evident  statements or reviews of the general state of the art will not  ordinarily be withheld.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> OA will withhold all cost data submitted except the total  estimated cost for each year of the contract. Where appropriate, OA will  release unit pricing data except where that information would disclose  confidential information such as profit margins. It will release these  total estimated costs and ordinarily release explanatory material and  headings associated with the cost data, withholding only the figures  themselves. If a contractor believes some of the explanatory material  should be withheld, that material must be identified and a justification  be presented as to why it should not be released.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exemption 6 is not a blanket exemption for all personal  information. The Office will balance the need to keep a person's private  affairs from unnecessary public scrutiny with protection of the public's  right to information on Government records.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> As a general practice, the Office will release information about  any person named in a contract itself or about any person who signed a  contract as well as information given in a proposal about any officer of  a corporation submitting that proposal. Except for names and other  identifying details, the Office usually releases all information in  resumes concerning employees, including education and experience.  Efforts will be made to identify information that should be deleted and  offerors are urged to point out such material for guidance. Any  information in the proposal which might constitute an unwarranted  invasion of personal privacy if released should be identified and a  justification for non-release provided in order to receive proper  consideration.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The Office can protect the names of and identifying details  about other staff members who are described in a contract proposal if it  is clear that identification of these employees would assist competitors  in raiding and hiring them away. In this regard, names and other  identifying details could be protected under Exemption 4 (harmful to  competitive position) and also under Exemption 6 (it would be an  unwarranted invasion of personal privacy to release them). In such a  case, the Office would withhold names, home addresses, salaries,  telephone numbers, social security numbers, marital status and, if these  served to identify them, perhaps some details about past employment or  professional activities of these persons.
