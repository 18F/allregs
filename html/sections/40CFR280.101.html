The Regional Administrator may also consider other factors as is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The state must submit to the Regional Administrator a description of the state fund or other state assurance to be supplied as financial assurance, along with a list of the classes of underground storage tanks to which the funds may be applied. The Regional Administrator may require the state to submit additional information as is deemed necessary to make a determination regarding the acceptability of the state fund or other state assurance.

Within 60 days after the Regional Administrator notifies a state that a state fund or other state assurance is acceptable, the state must provide to each owner or operator for which it is assuming financial responsibility a letter or certificate describing the nature of the state's assumption of responsibility. The letter or certificate from the state must include, or have attached to it, the following information: the facility's name and address and the amount of funds for corrective action and/or for compensating third parties that is assured by the state. The owner or operator must maintain this letter or certificate on file as proof of financial responsibility in accordance with Sec.  280.107(b)(5).</p>
