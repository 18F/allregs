                            <p class="depth0">Fees and other charges equal as nearly as may be to the cost of the  assessment services rendered under the regulations, including  reassessments, shall be assessed and collected from applicants in  accordance with the following provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fees for Service. Except as otherwise provided in this section,  fees-for-service shall be based on the time required to render the  service provided calculated to the nearest 15-minute period, including  auditor's travel, review and approval of quality manual, the conduct of  the onsite audit, and time required to prepare reports and any other  documents in connection with the performance of service. The base hourly  rate for such service is $42.20 per hour for 8 hours or less of work  performed between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., Monday through Friday,  except on legal holidays. The premium hourly rate for all applicants is  $47.80 per hour charged to users of the service for the hours worked in  excess of 8 hours per day between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.; for  the hours worked between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., Monday through Friday; and  for any time worked on Saturday and Sunday, except on legal holidays.  The holiday rate for all applicants is $79.60 charged to users of the  service for all hours worked on legal holidays.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Travel charges. When service is requested at a place so distant  from an auditor's headquarters, or place of prior assignment on  circuitous routing, that a total of one-half hour or more is required  for the auditor to travel to such place and back to the headquarters, or  to the next place of assignment on a circuitous routing, the charge for  such service shall include mileage charge administratively determined by  the Department, and travel tolls, if applicable, or such travel prorated  against all the applicants furnished the service involved on an  equitable basis, or where the travel is made by public transportation  (including hired vehicles), a fee equal to the actual cost thereof.  However, the applicant will not be charged a new mileage rate without  notification before the service is rendered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Per diem charges. When service is requested at a place away from  the auditor's headquarters, the fee for such service shall include a per  diem charge if the employee performing the service is paid per diem in  accordance with existing travel regulations. Per diem charges to  applicants will cover the same period of time for which the auditor  receives per diem reimbursement. The per diem rate will be  administratively determined by the Department. However, the applicant  will not be charged a new per diem rate without notification before the  service is rendered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other costs. When costs, other than costs specified in  paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section are associated with  providing the services, the applicant will be charged for these costs.  The amount of the costs charged will be determined administratively by  the Department. However, the applicant will not be charged for such cost  without notification before the service is rendered of the charge for  such item of expense.</p>
