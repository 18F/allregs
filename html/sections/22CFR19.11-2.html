                                Sec. 19.11-2  Regular survivor annuity for a former spouse.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Divorce prior to retirement. If a participant or former  participant is divorced prior to commencement of annuity, any former  spouse shall be entitled to a pro rata share of such a principal's  maximum regular survivor annuity (based on service performed prior to  the first date the principal becomes   eligible for an annuity following the divorce) unless a different amount  is elected in a spousal agreement filed with PER/ER/RET within 12 months  after the divorce becomes final or at the time of the retirement,  whichever occurs first, or unless a different amount is specified by a  court prior to the death of the principal. The principal's annuity shall  be reduced at the commencing date under Sec. 19.10-2 in order to  provide the survivor annuity committed to the former spouse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Divorce after retirement. In the event an annuitant is divorced  after retirement (commencement of annuity), the maximum survivor annuity  that may be provided for that former spouse is limited to the amount  provided for that person at the time of retirement. Within that limit,  the former spouse is entitled to a pro rata share of the participant's  maximum survivor benefit (based on service performed prior to the  divorce) unless a different amount was elected in a spousal agreement  filed with PER/ER/RET at the time of retirement, or in the case of  retirement before February 15, 1981, filed with PER/ER/RET within 12  months after the divorce becomes final, or unless a different amount is  specified by a court prior to the death of the principal. For this  purpose, a joint election filed with PER/ER/RET at the time of  retirement is considered a spousal agreement. If the survivor annuity  for the former spouse is reduced at the time of the divorce (because the  pro rata share or the amount specified in a spousal agreement or court  order is less than the amount elected at retirement), the principal's  annuity shall be recomputed and paid, effective on the date the survivor  benefit is reduced, as if the lower amount had been elected at the  outset of retirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Death or remarriage of former spouse and transfer of survivor  benefit to a spouse. Remarriage below age 60 or death of a former spouse  while a principal is alive will disqualify the former spouse for  benefits under this section. In the event of such a remarriage or death  of a former spouse, the portion of a principal's survivor annuity  committed to that person will become available for transfer to any  spouse. If such a remarriage or death of the former spouse occurs after  the principal's annuity commences, any reduction in the principal's  annuity for that former spouse will be discontinued effective at the  beginning of the first month following the remarriage or death unless  the annuitant elects to provide or to increase a survivor benefit for a  spouse. Such an election may be made within one year after the annuitant  receives notice of the remarriage or death of his/her former spouse. The  Department (PER/ER/RET) and the annuitant shall each notify the other  promptly whenever either receives independent notice of such a  remarriage or death. If an election to transfer survivor benefits to a  spouse is not made by the annuitant, his/her annuity will be recomputed  and paid as if there had been no reduction for the discontinued survivor  benefit. If an annuity is so recomputed and an election is subsequently  made to designate as beneficiary a spouse to whom married for at least  one year at the time the election is made, the principal's annuity shall  be restored retroactively to its former, lower rate and then adjusted by  cost-of-living increases that have occured since the date of the first  recomputation. If an election is made for a spouse when the marriage has  not yet lasted a year, the procedures in Sec. 19.10-4 shall be  followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Amount of survivor annuity. The amount of a regular survivor  annuity is determined under Sec. 19.11-3(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special rules for election of survivor annuity for a person who  is a former spouse on February 15, 1981. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any participant, or former  participant eligible for a deferred annuity which has not yet commenced,  who, on February 15, 1981 has a former spouse, may at any time prior to  commencement of annuity, elect, with the consent of any spouse to whom  married at the time of the election, to receive a reduced annuity and  provide a regular survivor annuity for such former spouse. Such survivor  annuity shall be limited by Sec. 19.10-2(b). An election under this  paragraph for a former spouse will reduce the amount of any regular  survivor annuity that may subsequently be provided for any spouse or  other former spouse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any former participant in receipt of an annuity who has a former  spouse on February 15, 1981 and who has not committed his/her entire  annuity as a base for a regular survivor annuity for a spouse or any  other former spouse, may, prior to December 31, 1982, designate any  portion of the uncommitted base as the base for a regular survivor  annuity for such former spouse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The annuity of a former participant making an election under  this paragraph shall be reduced under Sec. 19.10-2(a) effective  February 15, 1981, or from its commencing date if later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An election under this paragraph shall be made by filing a  spousal agreement with PER/ER/RET under Sec. 19.7. A spousal agreement  to provide a regular survivor annuity under this paragraph for a former  spouse may be revoked or amended after its acceptance by PER/ER/RET as  in accordance with the Act and these regulations, only by agreement of  the parties up to the last day allowed by this paragraph for filing such  an agreement. Thereafter, it is irrevocable. If a participant dies in  service after having filed a valid election under this section, a  survivor annuity will be paid to an eligible former suriving spouse in  accordance with the terms of the election.</p>
