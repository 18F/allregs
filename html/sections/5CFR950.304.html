                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Local federations must ensure that only those member organizations that comply with all eligibility requirements included in these regulations are certified for participation in the CFC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the LFCC requests information supporting a certification of local eligibility, that information shall be furnished promptly. Failure to furnish such information within 10 business days of the receipt of the request constitutes grounds for the denial of local eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each federation, as fiscal agent for its member organizations, must ensure that Federal employee designations are honored in that each member organization receives its proportionate share of receipts based on the results of each individual campaign. The proportionate share of receipts is determined by donor designations to the individual member organization as compared to total campaign designations.
