                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In response to an alleged violation of any provision of the Act or this chapter or the conditions of a license or an order issued by the Commission, the Commission may serve on the licensee or other person subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission a written notice of violation; a separate notice may be omitted if an order pursuant to Sec. 2.202 or demand for information pursuant to Sec. 2.204 is issued that otherwise identifies the apparent violation. The notice of violation will concisely state the alleged violation and may require that the licensee or other person submit, within 20 days of the date of the notice or other specified time, a written explanation or statement in reply if the Commission believes that the licensee has not already addressed all the issues contained in the notice of violation, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Corrective steps which have been taken by the licensee or other person and the results achieved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Corrective steps which will be taken; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date when full compliance will be achieved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The notice may require the licensee or other person subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission to admit or deny the violation and to state the reasons for the violation, if admitted. It may provide that, if an adequate reply is not received within the time specified in the notice, the Commission may issue an order or a demand for information as to why the license should not be modified, suspended or revoked or why such other action as may be proper should not be taken.
