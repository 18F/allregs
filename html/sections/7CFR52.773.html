the grades of the finished product since sirup, or any other liquid medium, as such, is not a factor of quality for the purpose of the grades. The designation of liquid packing media and Brix measurements, where applicable, are as follows:

(68 [deg]F.), but without correction for invert sugars or other substances. The Brix measurement of the packing media may be determined by any other method which gives equivalent results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Brix determination is made on the packing media 15 days or more after the cherries are canned or on the blended homogenized slurry of the comminuted entire contents of the container if canned for less than 15 days.
