                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A producer, seed stock producer, or feeder who produces  (including producing by feeding) only products that are eligible to be  labeled as 100 percent organic under the National Organic Program (NOP)  (7 CFR part 205), except as provided for in paragraph (h) of this  section; a handler who handles only products that are eligible to be  labeled as 100 percent organic under the NOP; or an exporter who exports  only products that are eligible to be labeled as 100 percent organic  under the NOP; and who operates under an approved NOP system plan and is  not a split operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To apply for an exemption under this section, the person shall  submit the request to the Board--on a form provided by the Board--at any  time initially and annually thereafter on or before January 1 as long as  the person continues to be eligible for the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The request shall include the following: the person's name and  address, a copy of the organic farm or organic handling operation  certificate provided by a USDA-accredited certifying agent as defined in  section 2103 of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C.  6502), a signed certification that the applicant meets all of the  requirements specified for an assessment exemption, and such other  information as may be required by the Board and with the approval of the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the person complies with the requirements of this section,  the Board will grant the exemption and issue a Certificate of Exemption  to the producer. For exemption requests received on or before August 15,  2005, the Board will have 60 days to approve the exemption request;  after August 15, 2005, the Board will have 30 days to approve the  exemption request. If the application is disapproved, the Board will  notify the applicant of the reason(s) for disapproval within the same  timeframe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An exempt producer shall provide a copy of the Certificate of  Exemption to each person to whom the producer sells ovine animals or  lamb and lamb products.

Reasons for conventional sales include lack of demand for  organic products, isolated use of antibiotics for humane purposes,  chemical or pesticide use as the result of State or emergency spray  programs, and crops from a buffer area as described in 7 CFR part 205,  provided all other criteria are met.
