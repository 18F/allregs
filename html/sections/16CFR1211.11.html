(1) When installed as described in Sec. 1211.10(a) (1)-(4), a photoelectric sensor shall sense an obstruction as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section that is to be placed on the floor at three points over the width of the door opening, at distances of 1 foot (305 mm) from each end and the midpoint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When installed as described in Sec. 1211.10(a) (1)-(4), a photoelectric sensor shall sense an obstruction as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section that is to be placed on the floor at three points over the width of the door opening, at distances of 1 foot (305 mm) from each end and the midpoint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The obstruction noted in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall consist of a white vertical surface 6 inches (152 mm) high by 12 inches (305 mm) long. The obstruction is to be centered under the door perpendicular to the plane of the door when in the closed position. See figure 3.

The lamp is to be positioned 5 feet from the front of the receiver and aimed directly at the sensor at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees from the axis of the beam. See figure 5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the photoelectric sensor uses a reflector, this test is to be repeated with the lamp aimed at the reflector.</p>
