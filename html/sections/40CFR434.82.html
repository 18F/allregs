The Sediment Control Plan must be approved by the permitting authority and be incorporated into the permit as an effluent limitation. The Sediment Control Plan must identify best management practices (BMPs) and also must describe design specifications, construction specifications, maintenance schedules, criteria for inspection, as well as expected performance and longevity of the best management practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Using watershed models, the operator must demonstrate that implementation of the Sediment Control Plan will result in average annual sediment yields that will not be greater than the sediment yield levels from pre-mined, undisturbed conditions. The operator must use the same watershed model that was, or will be, used to acquire the SMCRA permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The operator must design, implement, and maintain BMPs in the manner specified in the Sediment Control Plan.</p>
