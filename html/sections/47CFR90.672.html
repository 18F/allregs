                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. Except as provided in 47 CFR 90.617(k), unacceptable  interference to non-cellular licensees in the 800 MHz band from 800 MHz  cellular systems or part 22 of this chapter, Cellular Radiotelephone  systems and within the 900 MHz Business/Industrial Land Transportation  (B/ILT) Pool will be deemed to occur when the below conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A transceiver at a site at which interference is encountered:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is in good repair and operating condition, and is receiving:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A median desired signal strength of -104 dBm or higher if  operating in   the 800 MHz band, or a median desired signal strength of -88 dBm if  operating in the 900 MHz B/ILT Pool, as measured at the R.F. input of  the receiver of a mobile unit; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A median desired signal strength of -101 dBm or higher if  operating in the 800 MHz band, or a median desired signal strength of - 85 dBm if operating in the 900 MHz B/ILT Pool, as measured at the R.F.  input of the receiver of a portable i.e., hand-held unit; and either</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is a voice transceiver:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> With manufacturer published performance specifications for the  receiver section of the transceiver equal to, or exceeding, the minimum  standards set out in paragraph (b) of this section, and;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Receiving an undesired signal or signals which cause the  measured Carrier to Noise plus Interference (C/(I + N)) ratio of the  receiver section of said transceiver to be less than 20 dB if operating  in the 800 MHz band, or less than 17 dB if operating in the 900 MHz B/ ILT Pool, or;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is a non-voice transceiver receiving an undesired signal or  signals which cause the measured bit error rate (BER) (or some  comparable specification) of the receiver section of said transceiver to  be more than the value reasonably designated by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provided, however, that if the receiver section of the mobile or  portable voice transceiver does not conform to the standards set out in  paragraph (b) of this section, then that transceiver shall be deemed  subject to unacceptable interference only at sites where the median  desired signal satisfies the applicable threshold measured signal power  in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) of this section after an upward adjustment to  account for the difference in receiver section performance. The upward  adjustment shall be equal to the increase in the desired signal required  to restore the receiver section of the subject transceiver to the 20 dB  C/(I + N) ratio of paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. The adjusted  threshold levels shall then define the minimum measured signal power(s)  in lieu of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) of this section at which the licensee  using such non-compliant transceiver is entitled to interference  protection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minimum Receiver Requirements. Voice transceivers capable of  operating in the 806-824 MHz portion of the 800 MHz band, or in the 900  MHz Business/Industrial Land Transportation Pool, shall have the  following minimum performance specifications in order for the system in  which such transceivers are used to claim entitlement to full protection  against unacceptable interference. (See paragraph (a)(2) of this  section.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Voice units intended for mobile use: 75 dB intermodulation  rejection ratio; 75 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; -116 dBm  reference sensitivity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Voice units intended for portable use: 70 dB intermodulation  rejection ratio; 70 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; -116 dBm  reference sensitivity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Voice units intended for mobile or portable use in the 900 MHz  Business/Industrial Land Transportation Pool: 60 dB intermodulation  rejection ratio; 60 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; -116 dBm  reference sensitivity.
