                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of categorical pretreatment standard--baseline report. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical Pretreatment Standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under Sec. 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing Industrial Users subject to such categorical Pretreatment Standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the Control Authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (b)(1)-(7) of this section. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, New Sources, and sources that become Industrial Users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical Standard, shall be required to submit to the Control Authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (b)(1)-(5) of this section. New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New Sources shall give estimates of the information requested in paragraphs (b) (4) and (5) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identifying information. The User shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Permits. The User shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Description of operations. The User shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and Standard Industrial Classification of the operation(s) carried out by such Industrial User. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of Discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Flow measurement. The User shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Regulated process streams; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of Sec. 403.6(e). (See paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section.)
The Control Authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Measurement of pollutants. (i) The user shall identify the Pretreatment Standards applicable to each regulated process;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In addition, the User shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the Standard or Control Authority) of regulated pollutants in the Discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. In cases where the Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice or pollution prevention alternative, the User shall submit documentation as required by the Control Authority or the applicable Standards to determine compliance with the Standard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The User shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the User should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of Sec. 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the Pretreatment Standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with Sec. 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the Control Authority;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the Administrator determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the Administrator;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The Control Authority may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant Discharges to the POTW;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the Industrial User (as defined in paragraph (l) of this section) and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether Pretreatment Standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O and M) and/or additional Pretreatment is required for the Industrial User to meet the Pretreatment Standards and Requirements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O and M will be required to meet the Pretreatment Standards; the shortest schedule by which the Industrial User will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O and M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable Pretreatment Standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where the Industrial User's categorical Pretreatment Standard has been modified by a removal allowance (Sec. 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (Sec. 403.6(e)), and/or a Fundamentally Different Factors variance (Sec. 403.13) at the time the User submits the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, the information required by paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall pertain to the modified limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the categorical Pretreatment Standard is modified by a removal allowance (Sec. 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (Sec. 403.6(e)), and/or a Fundamentally Different Factors variance (Sec. 403.13) after the User submits the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, any necessary amendments to the information requested by paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall be submitted by the User to the Control Authority within 60 days after the modified limit is approved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Compliance schedule for meeting categorical Pretreatment Standards. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by paragraph (b)(7) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the Industrial User to meet the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No increment referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall exceed 9 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the Industrial User shall submit a progress report to the Control Authority including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the Industrial User to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than 9 months elapse between such progress reports to the Control Authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards or in the case of a New Source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any Industrial User subject to Pretreatment Standards and Requirements shall submit to the Control Authority a report containing the information described in paragraphs (b) (4)-(6) of this section. For Industrial Users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Control Authority in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the User's long term production rate. For all other Industrial Users subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the User's actual production during the appropriate sampling period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Periodic reports on continued compliance. (1) Any Industrial User subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard (except a Non-Significant Categorical User as defined in Sec. 403.3(v)(2)), after the compliance date of such Pretreatment Standard, or, in the case of a New Source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the Control Authority during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by the Control Authority or the Approval Authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such categorical Pretreatment Standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the Discharge reported in paragraph (b)(4) of this section except that the Control Authority may require more detailed reporting of flows. In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice (or pollution prevention alternative), the User shall submit documentation required by the Control Authority or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the User. At the discretion of the Control Authority and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Control Authority may modify the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Control Authority may authorize the Industrial User subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical Pretreatment Standard if the Industrial User has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the Industrial User. This authorization is subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Control Authority may authorize a waiver where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the Permit or other equivalent individual control mechanism, but in no case longer than 5 years. The User must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent control mechanism.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the Industrial User must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.</p><p class="depth0">The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section and include the certification statement in Sec. 403.6(a)(2)(ii). Non-detectable sample results may only be used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Control Authority must be included as a condition in the User's control mechanism. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the User in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the Control Authority for 3 years after expiration of the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the User's control mechanism by the Control Authority, the Industrial User must certify on each report with the statement below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the Industrial User:</p><p class="depth0">Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR -------------- [specify applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of ------------ [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under 40 CFR 403.12(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present based on changes that occur in the User's operations, the User must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Control Authority; and notify the Control Authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Control Authority may reduce the requirement in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by the Approval Authority, where the Industrial User meets all of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Industrial User's total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 0.01 percent of the design dry weather hydraulic capacity of the POTW, or 5,000 gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the Industrial User discharges in batches;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 0.01 percent of the design dry weather organic treatment capacity of the POTW; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> 0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard for which approved local limits were developed by a POTW in accordance with Sec. 403.5(c) and paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Industrial User has not been in significant noncompliance, as defined in Sec. 403.8(f)(2)(viii), for any time in the past two years;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Industrial User does not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that decreasing the reporting requirement for this Industrial User would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Industrial User must notify the Control Authority immediately of any changes at its facility causing it to no longer meet conditions of paragraphs (e)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section. Upon notification, the Industrial User must immediately begin complying with the minimum reporting in paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Control Authority must retain documentation to support the Control Authority's determination that a specific Industrial User qualifies for reduced reporting requirements under paragraph (e)(3) of this section for a period of 3 years after the expiration of the term of the control mechanism.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For Industrial Users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Control Authority in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 403.6(c), the report required by paragraph (e)(1) shall contain a reasonable measure of the User's long term production rate. For all other Industrial Users subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by paragraph (e)(1) shall include the User's actual average production rate for the reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Notice of potential problems, including slug loading. All categorical and non-categorical Industrial Users shall notify the POTW immediately of all discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings, as defined by Sec. 403.5(b), by the Industrial User.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Monitoring and analysis to demonstrate continued compliance. (1) Except in the case of Non-Significant Categorical Users, the reports required in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (h) of this section shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the Discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the Control Authority, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable Pretreatment Standards. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the Control Authority in lieu of the Industrial User. Where the POTW performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User, the User will not be required to submit the compliance certification required under paragraphs (b)(6) and (d) of this section. In addition, where the POTW itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow data, the Industrial User will not be required to submit the report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If sampling performed by an Industrial User indicates a violation, the User shall notify the Control Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Control Authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the Control Authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User, the Control Authority must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the User of the violation and requires the User to perform the repeat analysis. Resampling is not required if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Control Authority performs sampling at the Industrial User at a frequency of at least once per month; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Control Authority performs sampling at the User between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the User or the Control Authority receives the results of this sampling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The reports required in paragraphs (b), (d), (e) and (h) of this section must be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The Control Authority shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by Industrial Users with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Control Authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Control Authority, the samples must be representative of the Discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the Industrial User file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil & grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Control Authority, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Control Authority may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs (e) and (h) of this section, the Control Authority shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by Industrial Users with Applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the Administrator. (See, Secs. 136.4 and 136.5.) Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the Administrator. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the Administrator determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If an Industrial User subject to the reporting requirement in paragraph (e) or (h) of this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the Control Authority, using the procedures prescribed in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Reporting requirements for Industrial Users not subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards. The Control Authority must require appropriate reporting from those Industrial Users with Discharges that are not subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards. Significant Non-categorical Industrial Users must submit to the Control Authority at least once every six months (on dates specified by the Control Authority) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the Control Authority. In cases where a local limit requires compliance with a Best Management Practice or pollution prevention alternative, the User must submit documentation required by the

Control Authority to determine the compliance status of the User. These reports must be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and in accordance with the techniques described in part 136 and amendments thereto. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the Control Authority in lieu of the significant non-categorical Industrial User.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Annual POTW reports. POTWs with approved Pretreatment Programs shall provide the Approval Authority with a report that briefly describes the POTW's program activities, including activities of all participating agencies, if more than one jurisdiction is involved in the local program. The report required by this section shall be submitted no later than one year after approval of the POTW's Pretreatment Program, and at least annually thereafter, and shall include, at a minimum, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An updated list of the POTW's Industrial Users, including their names and addresses, or a list of deletions and additions keyed to a previously submitted list. The POTW shall provide a brief explanation of each deletion. This list shall identify which Industrial Users are subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards and specify which Standards are applicable to each Industrial User. The list shall indicate which Industrial Users are subject to local standards that are more stringent than the categorical Pretreatment Standards. The POTW shall also list the Industrial Users that are subject only to local Requirements. The list must also identify Industrial Users subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards that are subject to reduced reporting requirements under paragraph (e)(3), and identify which Industrial Users are Non-Significant Categorical Industrial Users.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A summary of the status of Industrial User compliance over the reporting period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A summary of compliance and enforcement activities (including inspections) conducted by the POTW during the reporting period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A summary of changes to the POTW's pretreatment program that have not been previously reported to the Approval Authority; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any other relevant information requested by the Approval Authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Notification of changed Discharge. All Industrial Users shall promptly notify the Control Authority (and the POTW if the POTW is not the Control Authority) in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their Discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the Industrial User has submitted initial notification under paragraph (p) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Compliance schedule for POTW's. The following conditions and reporting requirements shall apply to the compliance schedule for development of an approvable POTW Pretreatment Program required by Sec. 403.8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the development and implementation of a POTW Pretreatment Program (e.g., acquiring required authorities, developing funding mechanisms, acquiring equipment);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No increment referred to in paragraph (k)(1) of this section shall exceed nine months;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the POTW shall submit a progress report to the Approval Authority including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps taken by the POTW to return to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the Approval Authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Signatory requirements for Industrial User reports. The reports required by paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section shall include the certification statement as set forth in Sec. 403.6(a)(2)(ii), and shall be signed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> By a responsible corporate officer, if the Industrial User submitting the reports required by paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section is a corporation.
