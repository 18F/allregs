In accordance with those rules and the  Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 as amended (44 U.S.C. 3507), the Forest  Service has received approval by the Office of Management and Budget to  collect cave nomination information under clearance number 0596-0123 and  confidential information under 0596-0122. The information provided for  the cave nominations will be used to determine which caves will be  listed as ``significant'' and the information in the requests to obtain  confidential cave information will be used to decide whether to grant  access to this information. Response to the call for cave nominations is  voluntary. No action may be taken against a person for refusing to  supply the information requested. Response to the information  requirements for obtaining confidential cave information is required to  obtain a benefit in accordance with section 5 of the Federal Cave  Resources Protection Act of 1988 (16 U.S.C. 4304).</p>
