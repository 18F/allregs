                            <p class="depth0">This section describes the emission testing you must perform to show compliance with the emission standards in Sec.  1039.101(a) and (b) or Sec.  1039.102(a) and (b). See Sec.  1039.205(p) regarding emission testing related to the NTE standards. See Sec.  1039.240, Sec.  1039.245, and 40 CFR part 1065, subpart E, regarding service accumulation before emission testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Test your emission-data engines using the procedures and equipment specified in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Select an emission-data engine from each engine family for testing. Select the engine configuration with the highest volume of fuel injected per cylinder per combustion cycle at the point of maximum torque--unless good engineering judgment indicates that a different engine configuration is more likely to exceed (or have emissions nearer to) an applicable emission standard or FEL. If two or more engines have the same fueling rate at maximum torque, select the one with the highest fueling rate at rated speed. In making this selection, consider all factors expected to affect emission-control performance and compliance with the standards, including emission levels of all exhaust constituents, especially NOX and PM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may measure emissions from any of your emission-data engines or other engines from the engine family, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We may decide to do the testing at your plant or any other facility. If we do this, you must deliver the engine to a test facility we designate. The engine you provide must include appropriate manifolds, aftertreatment devices, electronic control units, and other emission-related components not normally attached directly to the engine block. If we do the testing at your plant, you must schedule it as soon as possible and make available the instruments, personnel, and equipment we need.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If we measure emissions on one of your engines, the results of that testing become the official emission results for the engine. Unless we later invalidate these data, we may decide not to consider your data in determining if your engine family meets applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before we test one of your engines, we may set its adjustable parameters to any point within the physically adjustable ranges (see Sec.  1039.115(e)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Before we test one of your engines, we may calibrate it within normal production tolerances for anything we do not consider an adjustable parameter. For example, this would apply

for an engine parameter that is subject to production variability because it is adjustable during production, but is not considered an adjustable parameter (as defined in Sec.  1039.801) because it is permanently sealed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may ask to use carryover emission data from a previous model year instead of doing new tests, but only if all the following are true:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The engine family from the previous model year differs from the current engine family only with respect to model year or other characteristics unrelated to emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The emission-data engine from the previous model year remains the appropriate emission-data engine under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The data show that the emission-data engine would meet all the requirements that apply to the engine family covered by the application for certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> We may require you to test a second engine of the same or different configuration in addition to the engine tested under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If you use an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 1065.10 and later testing shows that such testing does not produce results that are equivalent to the procedures specified in subpart F of this part, we may reject data you generated using the alternate procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Measure CO2 and CH4 with each low-hour certification test using the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065 in the 2011 and 2012 model years, respectively. Also measure N2O with each low-hour certification test using the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065 starting in the 2013 model year for any engine family that depends on NOx aftertreatment to meet emission standards. Small-volume engine manufacturers may omit measurement of N2O and CH4. These measurements are not required for NTE testing. Use the same units and modal calculations as for your other results to report a single weighted value for each constituent. Round the final values as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Round CO2 to the nearest 1 g/kW-hr.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Round N2O to the nearest 0.001 g/kW-hr.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Round CH4 to the nearest 0.001g/kW-hr.
