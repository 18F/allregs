                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This test procedure is designed to test certain  performance parameters of the candidate sampler during a test period in  which power interruptions of various duration occur. The performance  parameters tested are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Proper flow rate performance of the sampler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Accuracy of the sampler's average flow rate, CV, and sample  volume measurements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Accuracy of the sampler's reported elapsed sampling time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Accuracy of the reported time and duration of power  interruptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This test shall be conducted during operation of the test  sampler over a continuous 6-hour test period during which the sampler's  flow rate shall be measured and recorded at intervals not to exceed 5  minutes. The performance parameters tested under this procedure, the  corresponding minimum performance specifications, and the applicable  test conditions are summarized in table E-1 of this subpart. Each  performance parameter tested, as described or determined in the test  procedure, must meet or exceed the associated performance specification  to successfully pass this test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Required test equipment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Flow rate meter, suitable for  measuring and recording the actual volumetric sample flow rate at the  sampler downtube, with a minimum range of 10 to 25 L/min, 2 percent  certified, NIST-traceable accuracy. Optional capability for continuous  (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to  exceed 5 minutes is recommended. While a flow meter which provides a  direct indication of volumetric flow rate is preferred for this test, an  alternative certified flow measurement device may be used as long as  appropriate volumetric flow rate corrections are made based on  measurements of actual ambient temperature and pressure conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ambient air temperature sensor (if needed for volumetric  corrections to flow rate measurements), with a resolution of 0.1 C,  certified accurate to within 0.5 C, and continuous (analog) recording  capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Barometer (if needed for volumetric corrections to flow rate  measurements), range 600 mm Hg to 800 mm Hg, certified accurate to 2 mm  Hg, with continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording  at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Flow measurement adaptor (40 CFR part 50, appendix L, figure L- 30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sample flow rate  at the sampler downtube.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Means for creating an additional pressure drop of 55 mm Hg in  the sampler to simulate a heavily loaded filter, such as an orifice or  flow restrictive plate installed in the filter holder or a valve or  other flow restrictor temporarily installed in the flow path near the  filter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Teflon sample filter, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR part  50, appendix L (if required).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Time measurement system, accurate to within 10 seconds per day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Calibration of test measurement instruments. Submit  documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration,  certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if  required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy  of flow rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest  pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at  zero and at least one flow rate within [3 percent of 16.7 L/min within 7  days prior to use for this test. Where an instrument's measurements are  to be recorded with an analog recording device, the accuracy of the  entire instrument-recorder system shall be calibrated or verified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Test setup. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Setup of the sampler shall be performed as  required in this paragraph (d) and otherwise as described in the  sampler's operation or instruction manual referred to in  Sec. 53.4(b)(3). The sampler shall be installed upright and set up in  its normal configuration for collecting PM samples. A sample filter and  (or) the device for creating an additional 55 mm Hg pressure drop shall  be installed for the duration of these tests. The sampler's ambient  temperature, ambient pressure, and flow measurement systems shall all be  calibrated per the sampler's operating manual within 7 days prior to  this test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The inlet of the candidate sampler shall be removed and the flow  measurement adaptor installed on the sample downtube. A leak check as  described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual shall be  conducted and must be properly passed before other tests are carried  out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The inlet of the flow measurement adaptor shall be connected to  the outlet of the flow rate meter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Procedure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Set up the sampler as specified in paragraph (d)  of this section and otherwise prepare the sampler for normal sample  collection operation as directed in the sampler's operation or  instruction manual. Set the sampler to automatically start a 6-hour  sample collection period at a convenient time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> During the entire 6-hour operational flow rate portion of the  test, measure and record the sample flow rate with the flow rate meter  at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. If ambient temperature and  pressure corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate,  ambient temperature and pressure shall be measured at the same frequency  as that of the certified flow rate measurements. Note and record the  actual start and stop times for the 6-hour flow rate test period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> During the 6-hour test period, interrupt the AC line electrical  power to the sampler 5 times, with durations of 20 seconds, 40 seconds,  2 minutes, 7 minutes, and 20 minutes (respectively), with not less than  10 minutes of normal electrical power supplied between each power  interruption. Record the hour and minute and duration of each power  interruption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> At the end of the test, terminate the sample period (if not  automatically terminated by the sampler) and download all archived  instrument data from the test sampler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Test results. At the completion of the sampling period, validate  the test   conditions and determine the test results as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mean sample flow rate. (i) From the certified measurements  (Qref) of the test sampler flow rate, tabulate each flow rate  measurement in units of L/min. If ambient temperature and pressure  corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate, each  measured flow rate shall be corrected using its corresponding  temperature and pressure measurement values. Calculate the mean flow  rate for the sample period (Qref,ave) as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 6 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.068  where:  n equals the number of discrete certified flow rate measurements over</p><p class="depth0">the 6-hour test period, excluding flow rate values obtained</p><p class="depth0">during periods of power interruption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Calculate the percent difference between this mean flow rate  value and the design value of 16.67 L/min, as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 7 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.069</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To successfully pass this test, the percent difference  calculated in Equation 7 of this paragraph (f)(1)(ii) must be within [5  percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sample flow rate regulation. (i) From the certified measurements  of the test sampler flow rate, calculate the sample coefficient of  variation of the discrete measurements as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 8 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.070</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To successfully pass this test, the calculated coefficient of  variation for the certified flow rates must not exceed 2 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Flow rate measurement accuracy. (i) Using the mean volumetric  flow rate reported by the candidate test sampler at the completion of  the 6-hour test (Qind,ave), determine the accuracy of the  reported mean flow rate as:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 9 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.071</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To successfully pass this test, the percent difference  calculated in Equation 9 of this paragraph (f)(3) shall not exceed 2  percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Flow rate CV measurement accuracy. (i) Using the flow rate  coefficient of variation indicated by the candidate test sampler at the  completion of the 6-hour test (%CVind), determine the  accuracy of the reported coefficient of variation as:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 10 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.072</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To successfully pass this test, the absolute difference in  values calculated in Equation 10 of this paragraph (f)(4) must not  exceed 0.3 (CV%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Verify that the sampler properly provided a record and visual  display of the correct year, month, day-of-month, hour, and minute with  an accuracy of [2 minutes, of the start of each power interruption of  duration greater than 60 seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Calculate the actual elapsed sample time, excluding the periods  of electrical power interruption. Verify that the elapsed sample time  reported by the sampler is accurate to within [20 seconds for the 6-hour  test run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Calculate the sample volume as Qref.ave multiplied by  the sample time, excluding periods of power interruption. Verify that  the sample volume reported by the sampler is within 2 percent of the  calculated sample volume to successfully pass this test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Inspect the downloaded instrument data from the test sampler and  verify that all data are consistent with normal operation of the  sampler.
