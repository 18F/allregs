to prospective purchasers of such products at the time of original purchase and to the first purchaser of such products for purposes other than resale. The notification shall consist of a label on the product stating that it contains a chlorofluorocarbon that may harm the public health and environment by reducing the ozone in the upper atmosphere. Also, manufacturers and importers must provide the commission with reports identifying which of the self-pressurized consumer products sold by them contain chlorofluorocarbon propellants.</p>
