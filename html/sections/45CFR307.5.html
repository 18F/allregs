Waiver requests must be submitted and approved as  part of the State's APD or APD update.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conditions for waiver. The Secretary may grant a State a waiver  if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State demonstrates that it has an alternative approach to  the APD requirements or an alternative system configuration that enables  the State, in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, to be in  substantial compliance with the other requirements of this chapter; and  either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and (3) of the Act; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State provides written assurance that steps will be taken to  otherwise improve the State's Child Support Enforcement program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> APD submittal requirements for alternative system configuration.  APDs submitted by States which include requests for waiver for an  alternative system configuration must, in addition to meeting conditions  of Sec. 307.15(b):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe the State's base system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include a detailed description of the separate automated or  manual processes the State plans to use and how they will interface with  the base system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide documentation that the alternative system configuration  will enable the State to be in substantial compliance with title IV-D of  the Act in accordance with section 403(h) of the Act and implementing  regulations. In addition, if the State is subject to a Notice under  Sec. 305.99 of this part that it did not substantially comply with one  or more of the requirements of title IV-D of the Act, at the time a  waiver request is submitted, the State must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Demonstrate that the deficiency is not related to or caused by  the performance of the system; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specify the corrective action taken to modify the system if the  system contributed to the deficiency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> APD submittal requirements for alternative approach. APDs  submitted by States which include requests for waiver of conditions for  APD approval in Sec. 307.15(b) must demonstrate why meeting the  conditions is unnecessary or inappropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Review of waiver requests. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Office will review waiver  requests to assure that all necessary information is provided, that all  processes provide for effective and efficient program operation, and  that the conditions for waiver in paragraph (d) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a waiver is approved, it becomes part of the State's  approved APD. A waiver is subject to the APD suspension provisions in  Sec. 307.40.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a waiver is disapproved, the APD will be disapproved. The  APD disapproval is a final administrative decision and is not subject to  administrative appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> FFP limitations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of Sec. Sec. 307.30 and  307.35 apply to requests for FFP for costs of computerized support  enforcement systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FFP for alternative system configurations is further limited as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> FFP is available at the enhanced matching rate for development  of the base system and for hardware, operational system software, and  electronic linkages with the separate components of an alternative  system configuration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> FFP is available at the applicable matching rate for minor  alterations to the separate automated or manual processes that are part  of an alternative system configuration and for operating costs including  hardware, operational software and applications software of a  computerized support enforcement system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> FFP is not available for developing new systems or making  major changes and enhancements to separate automated or manual processes  so that alternative system configurations meet conditions for waiver.
