A State may apply for a waiver of any functional requirement in Sec. 307.10, or Sec. 307.11 by presenting

a plan for an alternative system configuration, or a waiver of any conditions for APD approval in Sec. 307.15(b) by presenting an alternative approach. Waiver requests must be submitted and approved as part of the State's APD or APD update.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conditions for waiver. The Secretary may grant a State a waiver if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State demonstrates that it has an alternative approach to the APD requirements or an alternative system configuration that enables the State, in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, to be in substantial compliance with the other requirements of this chapter; and either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The waiver request meets the criteria set forth in section 1115(c) (1), (2) and (3) of the Act; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State provides written assurance that steps will be taken to otherwise improve the State's Child Support Enforcement program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> APD submittal requirements for alternative system configuration.

In addition, if the State is subject to a Notice under Sec. 305.99 of this part that it did not substantially comply with one or more of the requirements of title IV-D of the Act, at the time a waiver request is submitted, the State must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Demonstrate that the deficiency is not related to or caused by the performance of the system; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specify the corrective action taken to modify the system if the system contributed to the deficiency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> APD submittal requirements for alternative approach. APDs submitted by States which include requests for waiver of conditions for APD approval in Sec. 307.15(b) must demonstrate why meeting the conditions is unnecessary or inappropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Review of waiver requests. (1) The Office will review waiver requests to assure that all necessary information is provided, that all processes provide for effective and efficient program operation, and that the conditions for waiver in paragraph (d) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Office will review waiver requests to assure that all necessary information is provided, that all processes provide for effective and efficient program operation, and that the conditions for waiver in paragraph (d) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a waiver is approved, it becomes part of the State's approved APD.
