                                Sec. 1002.100  Does the five-year service limit include all absences   uniformed services?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">No. The five-year period includes only the time the employee spends  actually performing service in the uniformed services. A period of  absence from employment before or after performing service in the  uniformed services does not count against the five-year limit. For  example, after the employee completes a period of service in the  uniformed services, he or she is provided a certain amount of time,  depending upon the length of service, to report back to work or submit  an application for reemployment. The period between completing the  uniformed service and reporting back to work or seeking reemployment  does not count against the five-year limit.</p>
