                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> There must be readily available for use under normal load conditions a main power supply sufficient to simultaneously energize the radiotelephone transmitter at its required antenna power, and the required receiver. Under this load condition the potential of the main power supply at the power input

terminals of the radiotelephone installation must not deviate from its rated potential by more than 10 percent on vessels completed on or after March 1, 1957, nor by more than 15 percent on vessels completed before that date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the main power supply consists of batteries, they must be installed as high above the bilge as practicable, secured against shifting with motion of the vessel, and accessible with not less than 26 cm (10 in.) head room.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Means must be provided for adequately charging any batteries used as a main power supply. There must be a device which gives a continuous indication of the rate and polarity of the charging current during charging.
