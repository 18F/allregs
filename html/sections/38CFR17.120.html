                            <p class="depth0">To the extent allowable, payment or reimbursement of the expenses of  emergency treatment, not previously authorized, in a private or public  (or Federal) hospital not operated by the Department of Veterans  Affairs, or of any emergency treatment not previously authorized  including transportation (except prosthetic appliances, similar devices,  and repairs) will be paid on the basis of a claim timely filed, under  the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For veterans with service connected disabilities. Emergency  treatment not previously authorized was rendered to a veteran in need of  such emergency treatment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For an adjudicated service-connected disability;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For nonservice-connected disabilities associated with and held  to be aggravating an adjudicated service-connected disability;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For any disability of a veteran who has a total disability  permanent in nature resulting from a service-connected disability (does  not apply outside of the States, Territories, and possessions of the  United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto  Rico); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For any illness, injury or dental condition in the case of a  veteran who is participating in a rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C.  ch. 31 and who is medically determined to be in need of hospital care or  medical services for any of the reasons enumerated in Sec.  17.47(i)(2);  and   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1724, 1728)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In a medical emergency. Emergency treatment not previously  authorized including medical services, professional services, ambulance  services, ancillary care and medication (including a short course of  medication related to and necessary for the treatment of the emergency  condition that is provided directly to the patient for use after the  emergency condition is stabilized and the patient is discharged) was  rendered in a medical emergency of such nature that a prudent layperson  would have reasonably expected that delay in seeking immediate medical  attention would have been hazardous to life or health. This standard is  met by an emergency medical condition manifesting itself by acute  symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) that a prudent  layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine  could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to  result in placing the health of the individual in serious jeopardy,  serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any  bodily organ or part. And,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When Federal facilities are unavailable. VA or other Federal  facilities that VA has an agreement with to furnish health care services  for veterans were not feasibly available, and an attempt to use them  beforehand or obtain prior VA authorization for the services required  would not have been reasonable, sound, wise, or practicable, or  treatment had been or would have been refused.
