                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cleaning of primary enclosures. Excreta and food waste must be  removed from inside each indoor primary enclosure daily and from  underneath them as often as necessary to prevent an excessive  accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent the nonhuman primates  from becoming soiled, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and  odors. Dirt floors, floors with absorbent bedding, and planted areas in  primary enclosures must be spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to  ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta, or as  often as necessary to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.  When steam or water is used to clean the primary enclosure, whether by  hosing, flushing, or other methods, nonhuman primates must be removed,  unless the enclosure is large enough to ensure the animals will not be  harmed, wetted, or distressed in the process. Perches, bars, and shelves  must be kept clean and replaced when worn. If the species of the  nonhuman primates housed in the primary enclosure engages in scent  marking, hard surfaces in the primary enclosure must be spot-cleaned  daily.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sanitization of primary enclosures and food and water  receptacles. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A used primary enclosure must be sanitized in  accordance with this section before it can be used to house another  nonhuman primate or group of nonhuman primates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indoor primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every  2 weeks and as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation  of dirt, debris, waste, food waste, excreta, or disease hazard, using  one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.  However, if the species of nonhuman primates housed in the primary  enclosure engages in scent marking, the primary enclosure must be  sanitized at regular intervals determined in accordance with generally  accepted professional and husbandry practices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hard surfaces of primary enclosures and food and water  receptacles must be sanitized using one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Live steam under pressure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Washing with hot water (at least 180 [deg]F (82.2 [deg]C)) and  soap or detergent, such as in a mechanical cage washer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Washing all soiled surfaces with appropriate detergent  solutions or disinfectants, or by using a combination detergent/ disinfectant product that accomplishes the same purpose, with a thorough  cleaning of the surfaces to remove organic material, so as to remove all  organic material and mineral buildup, and to provide sanitization  followed by a clean water rinse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Primary enclosures containing material that cannot be sanitized  using the methods provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, such as  sand, gravel, dirt, absorbent bedding, grass, or planted areas, must be  sanitized by removing the contaminated material as necessary to prevent  odors, diseases, pests, insects, and vermin infestation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Housekeeping for premises. Premises where housing facilities are  located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean  and in good repair in order to protect the nonhuman primates from  injury, to facilitate the husbandry practices required in this subpart,  and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents, pests,  and vermin. Premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk,  waste, and discarded matter. Weeds, grass, and bushes must be controlled  so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pest control. An effective program for control of insects,  external parasites affecting nonhuman primates, and birds and mammals  that are pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the  health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests  in animal areas.</p>
