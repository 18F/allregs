                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Place to make requests.

Each request to amend an  ASC record shall reasonably describe the record sought to be amended.  Such description should include, for example, relevant names, dates and  subject matter to permit the record to be located among the records  maintained by the ASC. An individual who has requested that a record  pertaining to the individual be amended will be advised promptly if the  record cannot be located on the basis of the description given and that  further identifying information is necessary before the request can be  processed. An initial evaluation of a request presented in person will  be made immediately to ensure that the request is complete and to  indicate what, if any, additional information will be required.  Verification of the individual's identity as set forth in Sec.  1102.102(a) (2), (3), (4) and (5) may also be required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Basis for amendment. An individual requesting an amendment to a  record pertaining to the individual shall specify the substance of the  amendment and set forth facts and provide such materials that would  support his or her contention that the record as maintained by the ASC  is not accurate, timely or complete, or that the record is not necessary  and relevant to accomplish a statutory purpose of the ASC as authorized  by law or by Executive Order of the President.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acknowledgement of requests for amendment. Receipt of a request  to amend a record pertaining to an individual normally will be  acknowledged in writing within 10 days after such request has been  received, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Federal holidays. When a  request to amend is made in person, the individual making the request  will be given a written acknowledgement when the request is presented.  The acknowledgement will describe the request received and indicate when  it is anticipated that action will be taken on the request. No  acknowledgement will be sent when the request for amendment will be  reviewed, and an initial decision made, within the 10 day period after  such request has been received.
