These agreements are neither procurement nor assistance in  nature, and therefore, are not subject to the Federal Grant and  Cooperative Agreements Act of 1977. Accordingly, proper use of these  cooperative agreements will promote and facilitate partnerships between  the REE Agency and the Cooperator in support of research, extension and  education projects of mutual benefit to each party.</p>
