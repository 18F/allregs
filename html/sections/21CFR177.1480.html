                            <p class="depth0">Nitrile rubber modified acrylonitrile-methyl acrylate copolymers identified in this section may be safely used as components of articles intended for food-contact use under conditions of use D, E, F, or G described in table 2 of Sec. 176.170(c) of this chapter, subject to the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the purpose of this section, nitrile rubber modified acrylonitrile-methyl acrylate copolymers consist of basic copolymers produced by the graft copolymerization of 73-77 parts by weight of acrylonitrile and 23-27 parts by weight of methyl acrylate in the presence of 8-10 parts by weight of butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymers containing approximately 70 percent by weight of polymer units derived from butadiene.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The nitrile rubber modified acrylonitrile-methyl acrylate basic copolymers meet the following specifications and extractives limitations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specifications. (i) Nitrogen content is in the range 16.5-19 percent as determined by Kjeldahl analysis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Nitrogen content is in the range 16.5-19 percent as determined by Kjeldahl analysis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Intrinsic viscosity in acetonitrile at 25 C is not less than 0.29 deciliter per gram as determined by ASTM method D1243-79, ``Standard Test Method for Dilute Solution Viscosity of Vinyl Chloride Polymers,'' which is incorporated by reference.

The following extractive limitations are determined by an infrared spectrophotometric method titled, ``Infrared Spectrophotometric Determination of Polymer Extracted from Borex [supreg] 210 Resin Pellets,'' which is incorporated by reference.

extract obtained when a 100-gram sample of the basic copolymers is extracted with 250 milliliters of reagent grade n-heptane at reflux temperature for 2 hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acrylonitrile copolymers identified in this section shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 180.22 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Acrylonitrile copolymers identified in this section are not authorized to be used to fabricate beverage containers.
