                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contents of opt out notice--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A notice must be  clear, conspicuous, and concise, and must accurately disclose:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the affiliate(s) providing the notice. If the notice  is provided jointly by multiple affiliates and each affiliate shares a  common name, such as ``ABC,'' then the notice may indicate that it is  being provided by multiple companies with the ABC name or multiple  companies in the ABC group or family of companies, for example, by  stating that the notice is provided by ``all of the ABC companies,''  ``the ABC banking, credit card, insurance, and securities companies,''  or by listing the name of each affiliate providing the notice. But if  the affiliates providing the joint notice do not all share a common  name, then the notice must either separately identify each affiliate by  name or identify each of the common names used by those affiliates, for  example, by stating that the notice is provided by ``all of the ABC and  XYZ companies'' or by ``the ABC bank and securities companies and the  XYZ insurance companies'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A list of the affiliates or types of affiliates whose use of  eligibility information is covered by the notice, which may include  companies that become affiliates after the notice is provided to the  consumer. If each affiliate covered by the notice shares a common name,  such as ``ABC,'' then the notice may indicate that it applies to  multiple companies with the ABC name or multiple companies in the ABC  group or family of companies, for example, by stating that the notice is  provided by ``all of the ABC companies,'' ``the ABC banking, credit  card, insurance, and securities companies,'' or by listing the name of  each affiliate providing the notice. But if the affiliates covered by  the notice do not all share a common name, then the notice must either  separately identify each covered affiliate by name or identify each of  the common names used by those affiliates, for example, by stating that  the notice applies to ``all of the ABC and XYZ companies'' or to ``the  ABC banking and securities companies and the XYZ insurance companies'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A general description of the types of eligibility information  that may be used to make marketing solicitations to the consumer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That the consumer may elect to limit the use of eligibility  information to make marketing solicitations to the consumer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> That the consumer's election will apply for the specified period  of time stated in the notice and, if applicable,   that the consumer will be allowed to renew the election once that period  expires;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If the notice is provided to consumers who may have previously  opted out, such as if a notice is provided to consumers annually, that  the consumer who has chosen to limit marketing solicitations does not  need to act again until the consumer receives a renewal notice; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A reasonable and simple method for the consumer to opt out.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Joint relationships. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If two or more consumers jointly obtain  a product or service, a single opt out notice may be provided to the  joint consumers. Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to  opt out.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The opt out notice must explain how an opt out direction by a  joint consumer will be treated. An opt out direction by a joint consumer  may be treated as applying to all of the associated joint consumers, or  each joint consumer may be permitted to opt out separately. If each  joint consumer is permitted to opt out separately, one of the joint  consumers must be permitted to opt out on behalf of all of the joint  consumers and the joint consumers must be permitted to exercise their  separate rights to opt out in a single response.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> It is impermissible to require all joint consumers to opt out  before implementing any opt out direction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alternative contents. If the consumer is afforded a broader  right to opt out of receiving marketing than is required by this  subpart, the requirements of this section may be satisfied by providing  the consumer with a clear, conspicuous, and concise notice that  accurately discloses the consumer's opt out rights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Model notices. Model notices are provided in the Appendix to  this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Coordinated and consolidated notices. A notice required by this  subpart may be coordinated and consolidated with any other notice or  disclosure required to be issued under any other provision of law by the  entity providing the notice, including but not limited to the notice  described in section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the FCRA (15 U.S.C.  1681a(d)(2)(A)(iii)) and the GLBA privacy notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Equivalent notices. A notice or other disclosure that is  equivalent to the notice required by this subpart, and that is provided  to a consumer together with disclosures required by any other provision  of law, satisfies the requirements of this section.</p>
