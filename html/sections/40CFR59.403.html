Excess VOC = The VOC content of the coating, or adjusted VOC content of</p><p class="depth2">a recycled coating (if applicable), in grams of VOC per liter</p><p class="depth2">of coating, minus the applicable VOC content limit from table</p><p class="depth2">1 of this subpart (that is, VOC content of the coating minus</p><p class="depth2">VOC content limit).
