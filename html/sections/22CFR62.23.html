A program must not  duplicate the student intern's prior experience.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Obligations of student internship program sponsors. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A  sponsor designated by the Department to administer a student internship  program must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Ensure that the student internship program is full-time (minimum  of 32 hours a week); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Ensure that any host organization or other third party involved  in the recruitment, selection, screening, placement, orientation,  evaluation, or provision of a student internship program is sufficiently  educated on the goals, objectives, and regulations of the Exchange  Visitor Program and adheres to all regulations set forth in this part as  well as all additional terms and conditions governing Exchange Visitor  Program administration that the Department may from time to time impose.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A sponsor must ensure that it or any host organization acting  on the sponsor's behalf:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Has sufficient resources, plant, equipment, and trained  personnel available to provide the specified student internship program;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Does not displace full- or part-time or temporary or permanent  American workers or serve to fill a labor need and ensures that the  position that the student interns fills exists solely to assist the  student intern in achieving the objectives of his or her participation  in a student internship program; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Certifies that student internship programs in the field of  agriculture meet all the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act,  as amended (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) and the Migrant and Seasonal  Agricultural Worker Protection Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Screening and vetting host organizations. A sponsor must  adequately screen all potential host organizations at which a student  intern will be placed by obtaining the following information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Dun & Bradstreet identification number (unless the host  organization is an academic institution, government entity, or family  farm);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Employer Identification Number (EIN) used for tax purposes;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Verification of telephone number, address, and professional  activities via advertising, brochures, Web site, and/or feedback from  prior participants; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Verification of Workman's Compensation Insurance Policy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Site visits. A sponsor must conduct a site visit of any host  organization that has not previously participated successfully in the  sponsor's student internship program, has fewer than 25 employees, or  has less than three million dollars in annual revenue. Any placement at  an academic institution or at a Federal, State, or local government  office is specifically excluded from this requirement. The purpose of  the site visit is for the sponsor to ensure that each host organization  possesses and maintains the ability and resources to provide structured  and guided work-based learning experiences according to individualized  T/IPPs, and that each host organization understands and meets its  obligations set forth in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use of third parties. A sponsor may engage a third party  (including, but not limited to a host organization, partner, local  business, governmental entity, academic institution, or any other  foreign or domestic agent) to assist it in the conduct of its designated  student internship program. Such a third party must have an executed  written agreement with the sponsor to act on behalf of the sponsor in  the conduct of the sponsor's program. This agreement must outline the  full relationship between the sponsor and third party on all matters  involving the administration of its exchange visitor program. A  sponsor's use of a third party does not relieve the sponsor of its  obligations to comply with and to ensure third party compliance with  Exchange Visitor Program regulations. Any failure by any third party to  comply with the regulations set forth in this part or with any  additional terms and conditions governing Exchange Visitor Program  administration that the Department may from time to time impose will be  imputed to the sponsor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Evaluation requirements. In order to ensure the quality of a  student internship program, a sponsor must develop procedures for  evaluating all student interns. All required evaluations   must be completed prior to the conclusion of a student internship  program, and the student intern and his or her immediate supervisor must  sign the evaluation forms. At a minimum, all programs require a  concluding evaluation, and programs lasting longer than six months also  require a midpoint evaluation. For programs exceeding six months'  duration, at a minimum, midpoint and concluding evaluations are  required. A sponsor must retain student intern evaluations (electronic  or hard copy) for a period of at least three years following the  completion of each student internship program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Employment, wages, or remuneration. A student intern is  permitted to engage in full-time employment during the student  internship program as outlined on his or her T/IPP, with or without  wages or other compensation. Employment is not required for  participation in the program. A student intern may be employed, however,  only with the approval of the responsible officer and the student's home  institution's dean or academic advisor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Training/Internship Placement Plan (Form DS-7002). </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A sponsor  must fully complete and obtain requisite signatures for a Form DS-7002  for each student intern before issuing a Form DS-2019. A sponsor must  provide to each signatory an executed copy of the Form DS-7002. Upon  request, a student intern must present his or her fully executed Form  DS-7002 to a Consular Official during the visa interview.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To further distinguish between work-based learning for student  interns, which is permitted, and ordinary employment or unskilled labor  which is not, a T/IPP must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> State the specific goals and objectives of the student  internship program (for each phase or component, if applicable);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Detail the knowledge, skills, or techniques to be imparted to  the student intern (for each phase or component, if applicable); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Describe the methods of performance evaluation and the frequency  of supervision (for each phase or component, if applicable).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Program exclusions. A sponsor designated by the Department to  administer a student internship program must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Not place a student intern in an unskilled or casual labor  position, in a position that requires or involves child care or elder  care, a position in the field of aviation, or, in clinical positions or  engaging in any other kind of work that involves patient care or  contact, including any work that would require student interns to  provide therapy, medication, or other clinical or medical care (e.g.,  sports or physical therapy, psychological counseling, nursing,  dentistry, veterinary medicine, social work, speech therapy, or early  childhood education);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not place a student intern in a position, occupation, or  business that could bring the Exchange Visitor Program or the Department  into notoriety or disrepute;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Not engage or otherwise cooperate or contract with a staffing/ employment agency to recruit, screen, orient, place, evaluate, or train  student interns, or in any other way involve such agencies in an  Exchange Visitor Program student internship program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Ensure that the duties of a student intern as outlined in the  T/IPP will not involve more than 20 per cent clerical work, and that all  tasks assigned to a student intern are necessary for the completion of  the student internship program; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Ensure that all ``Hospitality and Tourism'' student internship  programs of six months or longer contain at least three departmental or  functional rotations.
