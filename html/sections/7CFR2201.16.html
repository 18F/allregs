The FONSI will include the environmental  assessment or a summary of it and be available to the public from the  Board. The Board shall maintain a record of these decisions, making them  available to interested parties upon request. Requests should be  directed to LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Board, 1400 Independence  Ave., SW., Room 2919-S, Stop 1575; Washington, DC 20250-1575.
