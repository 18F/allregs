                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section sets forth the extent to which Rate-of-Return Carriers may recover, through the recovery mechanism outlined in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section, a portion of revenues lost due to rate reductions required by Sec. 20.11(b) of this chapter, and Sec. Sec. 51.705 and 51.909.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 2011 Interstate Switched Access Revenue Requirement. 2011 Interstate Switched Access Revenue Requirement means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a Rate-of-Return Carrier that participated in the NECA 2011 annual switched access tariff filing, its projected interstate switched access revenue requirement associated with the NECA 2011 annual interstate switched access tariff filing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a Rate-of-Return Carrier subject to Sec. 61.38 of this chapter that filed its own annual access tariff in 2010 and did not participate in the NECA 2011 annual switched access tariff filing, its projected interstate switched access revenue requirement in its 2010 annual interstate switched access tariff filing; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For a Rate-of-Return Carrier subject to Sec. 61.39 of this chapter that filed its own annual switched access tariff in 2011, its historically-determined annual interstate switched access revenue requirement filed with its 2011 annual interstate switched access tariff filing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Expected Revenues. Expected Revenues from an access service are calculated using the default transition rate for that service specified by Sec. 51.909 and forecast demand for that service. Expected Revenues from a non-access service are calculated using the default transition rate for that service specified by Sec. 20.11 of this chapter or Sec. 51.705 of this chapter and forecast net demand for that service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rate-of-Return Carrier Baseline Adjustment Factor. The Rate-of-Return Carrier Baseline Adjustment Factor, as used in calculating eligible recovery for Rate-of-Return Carriers, is equal to ninety-five (95) percent for the period beginning July 1, 2012. It is reduced by five (5) percent of its previous value in each subsequent annual tariff filing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Revenue Requirement. Revenue Requirement is equal to a carrier's regulated operating costs plus an 11.25 percent return on a carrier's net rate base calculated in compliance with the provisions of parts 36, 65 and 69 of this chapter. For an average schedule carrier, its Revenue Requirement shall be equal to the average schedule settlements it received from the pool, adjusted to reflect an 11.25 percent rate of return, or what it would have received if it had been a participant in the pool. If the reference is to an operating segment, these references are to the Revenue Requirement associated with that segment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> True-up Adjustment. The True-up Adjustment is equal to the True-up Revenues for any particular service for the period in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> True-up Revenues. True-up Revenues from an access service are equal to (projected demand minus actual realized demand for that service) times the default transition rate for that service specified by Sec. 51.909. True-up Revenues from a non-access service are equal to (projected demand minus actual realized net demand for that service) times the default transition rate

for that service specified by Sec. 20.11(b) of this chapter or Sec. 51.705. Realized demand is the demand for which payment has been received, or has been made, as appropriate, by the time the true-up is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> 2011 Rate-of-Return Carrier Base Period Revenue. 2011 Rate-of-Return Carrier Base Period Revenue is the sum of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 2011 Interstate Switched Access Revenue Requirement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fiscal Year 2011 revenues from Transitional Intrastate Access Service received by March 31, 2012; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fiscal Year 2011 reciprocal compensation revenues received by March 31, 2012, less Fiscal Year 2011 reciprocal compensation payments paid and/or payable by March 31, 2012</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> 2011 Rate-of-Return Carrier Base Period Revenue shall be adjusted to reflect the removal of any increases in revenue requirement or revenues resulting from access stimulation activity the Rate-of-Return Carrier engaged in during the relevant measuring period. A Rate-of-Return Carrier should make this adjustment for its initial July 1, 2012, tariff filing, but the adjustment may result from a subsequent Commission or court ruling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Eligible Recovery for Rate-of-Return Carriers. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules, a Rate-of-Return Carrier may recover the amounts specified in this paragraph through the mechanisms described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of the Commission's rules, a Rate-of-Return Carrier may recover the amounts specified in this paragraph through the mechanisms described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Beginning July 1, 2012, a Rate-of-Return Carrier's eligible recovery will be equal to the 2011 Rate-of-Return Carrier Base Period Revenue multiplied by the Rate-of-Return Carrier Baseline Adjustment Factor less:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Expected Revenues from Transitional Intrastate Access Service for the year beginning July 1, 2012, reflecting forecasted demand multiplied by the rates in the rate transition contained in Sec. 51.909;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The Expected Revenues from interstate switched access for the year beginning July 1, 2012, reflecting forecasted demand multiplied by the rates in the rate transition contained in Sec. 51.909; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Expected Net Reciprocal Compensation Revenues for the year beginning July 1, 2012 using the target methodology required by Sec. 51.705.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Beginning July 1, 2013, a Rate-of-Return Carrier's eligible recovery will be equal to the 2011 Rate-of-Return Carrier Base Period Revenue multiplied by the Rate-of-Return Carrier Baseline Adjustment Factor less:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Expected Revenues from Transitional Intrastate Access Service for the year beginning July 1, 2013, reflecting forecasted demand multiplied by the rates in the rate transition contained in Sec. 51.909;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The Expected Revenues from interstate switched access for the year beginning July 1, 2013, reflecting forecasted demand multiplied by the rates in the rate transition contained in Sec. 51.909; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Expected Net Reciprocal Compensation Revenues for the year beginning July 1, 2013 using the target methodology required by Sec. 51.705.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Beginning July 1, 2014, a Rate-of-Return Carrier's eligible recovery will be equal to the 2011 Rate-of-Return Carrier Base Period Revenue multiplied by the Rate-of-Return Carrier Baseline Adjustment Factor less:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Expected Revenues from Transitional Intrastate Access Service for the year beginning July 1, 2014, reflecting forecasted demand multiplied by the rates in the rate transition contained in Sec. 51.909 (including the reduction in intrastate End Office Switched Access Service rates), adjusted to reflect the True-Up Adjustment for Transitional Intrastate Access Service for the year beginning July 1, 2012;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The Expected Revenues from interstate switched access for the year beginning July 1, 2014, reflecting forecasted demand multiplied by the rates in the rate transition contained in Sec. 51.909, adjusted to reflect the True-Up Adjustment for Interstate Switched Access for the year beginning July 1, 2012; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Expected Net Reciprocal Compensation Revenues for the year beginning July 1, 2014 using the target methodology required by Sec. 51.705, adjusted to reflect the True-Up Adjustment for Reciprocal Compensation for the year beginning July 1, 2012.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> An amount equal to True-up Revenues for Access Recovery Charges for

the year beginning July 1, 2012 multiplied by negative one.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Beginning July 1, 2015, and for all subsequent years, a Rate-of-Return Carrier's eligible recovery will be calculated by updating the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section for the period beginning July 1, 2014, to reflect the passage of an additional year in each subsequent year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If a Rate-of-Return Carrier receives payments for intrastate or interstate switched access services or for Access Recovery Charges after the period used to measure the adjustments to reflect the differences between estimated and actual revenues, it shall treat such payments as actual revenue in the year the payment is received and shall reflect this as an additional adjustment for that year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If a Rate-of-Return Carrier receives or makes reciprocal compensation payments after the period used to measure the adjustments to reflect the differences between estimated and actual net reciprocal compensation revenues, it shall treat such amounts as actual revenues or payments in the year the payment is received or made and shall reflect this as an additional adjustment for that year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> If a Rate-of-Return Carrier recovers any costs or revenues that are already being recovered as Eligible Recovery through Access Recovery Charges or the Connect America Fund from another source, that carrier's ability to recover reduced switched access revenue from Access Recovery Charges or the Connect America Fund shall be reduced to the extent it receives duplicative recovery. Any duplicative recovery shall be reflected as a reduction to a carrier's Eligible Recovery calculated pursuant to Sec. 51.917(d). A Rate-of-Return Carrier seeking revenue recovery must annually certify as part of its tariff filings to the Commission and to the relevant state commission that the carrier is not seeking duplicative recovery in the state jurisdiction for any Eligible Recovery subject to the recovery mechanism.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)(A)</em> If a Rate-of-Return Carrier in any tariff period underestimates its projected demand for services covered by Sec. 51.917(b)(6) or 51.915(b)(13), and thus has too much Eligible Recovery in that tariff period, it shall refund the amount of any such True-up Revenues or True-up Revenues for Access Recovery Charge that are not offset by the Rate-of-Return Carrier's Eligible Recovery (calculated before including the true-up amounts in the Eligible Recovery calculation) in the true-up tariff period to the Administrator by August 1 following the date of the Rate-of-Return Carrier's annual access tariff filing.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If a Rate-of-Return Carrier in any tariff period underestimates its projected demand for services covered by Sec. 51.917(b)(6) or 51.915(b)(13), and thus has too much Eligible Recovery in that tariff period, it shall refund the amount of any such True-up Revenues or True-up Revenues for Access Recovery Charge that are not offset by the Rate-of-Return Carrier's Eligible Recovery (calculated before including the true-up amounts in the Eligible Recovery calculation) in the true-up tariff period to the Administrator by August 1 following the date of the Rate-of-Return Carrier's annual access tariff filing.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If a Rate-of-Return Carrier in any tariff period receives too little Eligible Recovery because it overestimates its projected demand for services covered by Sec. 51.917(b)(6) or 51.915(b)(13), which True-up Revenues and True-up Revenues for Access Recovery Charge it cannot recover in the true-up tariff period because the Rate-of-Return Carrier has a negative Eligible Recovery in the true-up tariff period (before calculating the true-up amount in the Eligible Recovery calculation), the Rate-of-Return Carrier shall treat the unrecoverable true-up amount as its Eligible Recovery for the true-up tariff period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Access Recovery Charge. (1) A charge that is expressed in dollars and cents per line per month may be assessed upon end users that may be assessed a subscriber line charge pursuant to Sec. 69.104 of this chapter, to the extent necessary to allow the Rate-of-Return Carrier to recover some or all of its Eligible Recovery determined pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, subject to the caps described in paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
