                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever a classification or declassification determination  concerning RD or FRD information is made, the Director of Classification  and the Chief Health, Safety and Security Officer shall be able to  justify the determination. For FRD and RD primarily related to military  utilization, the Director of Classification and the Chief Health, Safety  and Security Officer shall coordinate the determination and  justification with the DoD. If the determination involves a departure  from the presumptions in Sec. 1045.15, the justification shall include a  rationale for the departure. Often the justification itself will contain  RD or FRD information. In such a case, the Director of Classification  and the Chief Health, Safety and Security Officer shall ensure that a  separate justification can be prepared which is publicly releasable. The  publicly releasable justification shall be made available to any  interested person upon request to the Director of Classification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Director of Classification shall prepare a report on an  annual basis on the implementation of this part. This report shall be  available to any interested person upon request to the Director of  Classification. Requests may be submitted to the Director Office of  Classification, HS-90/Germantown Building, U.S. Department of Energy,  1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585-1290.
