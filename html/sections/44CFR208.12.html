                                Sec. 208.12  Maximum Pay Rate Table.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This section establishes the process for creating and  updating the Maximum Pay Rate Table (Table), and the Table's use to  reimburse Affiliated Personnel (Task Force Physicians, Task Force  Engineers, and Canine Handlers) and Backfill for Activated System  Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit  Participating Agency. Section 208.32 defines the ``Maximum Pay Rate  Table'' as ``the DHS-issued table that identifies the maximum pay rates  for selected System positions that may be used for reimbursement of  Affiliated Personnel compensation and Backfill for Activated System  Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit  Participating Agency.'' In that same section, the term ``Affiliated  Personnel'' is defined as ``individuals not normally employed by a  Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency and individuals normally  affiliated with a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency as  volunteers.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Scope of this section. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Maximum Pay Rate Table applies to  those individuals who are not normally employed by a Sponsoring Agency  or Participating Agency, or whose affiliation with a Sponsoring Agency  or Participating Agency is as a volunteer; that is, an individual whom  the Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency does not normally  compensate in any way, at any rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Table also applies to Backfill for Activated System Members  employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating  Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Method for determining maximum pay rates. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> DHS uses the  United States Office of Personnel Management's salary rates, computed  under 5 U.S.C. 5504, as the basis for the maximum pay rate schedule. DHS  considers System members' experience and sets maximum pay rates at the  maximum grade, middle step for each position, which demonstrates an  experience level of five years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) publishes salary and  locality pay schedules each calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Physicians. DHS uses the latest Special Salary Rate Table Number  0290 for Medical Officers (Clinical) Worldwide for physicians. The rates  used in the initial Table can be found at http://www.opm.gov/oca/03  tables/SSR/HTML/0290.asp.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Engineers and Canine Handlers. DHS uses the latest General  Schedule pay scale for both positions. Both specialties are compared to  the General Schedule pay scale to ensure parity with like specialties on  a task force (canine handlers are equated with rescue specialists). The  rates used in the initial Table can be found at http://www.opm.gov/oca/ 03tables/html/gs.asp.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Locality Pay. To determine adjustments for locality pay DHS  uses the latest locality pay areas (including the ``Rest of U.S.'' area)  established by   OPM. The rates used in the initial Table can be found at http:// www.opm.gov/oca/03tables/locdef.asp.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Review and update. DHS will review and update the Table  periodically, at least annually. The comments of Sponsoring and  Participating Agencies and their experience with the Table will be  considered and evaluated in the course of the reviews.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Initial rates and subsequent revisions. DHS will publish the  initial maximum pay rate table in the Federal Register as a notice with  request for comments. Subsequent revisions will be made to the pay rate  table as OPM changes salary rates as described in this section. When  subsequent revisions are made to the maximum pay rate table DHS will  publish the new maximum pay rate table in the Federal Register. The  rates will be effective for the latest year indicated by OPM. \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ In some years the latest year may not be the current calendar  year. For instance, OPM did not change its pay rates for calendar year  2004, and the 2003 schedules apply. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Application of the maximum pay rate table--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicability.  The Maximum Pay Rate Table sets forth maximum rates for which DHS will  reimburse the Sponsoring Agency for compensation paid to Activated  Affiliated Personnel and as Backfill for Activated System Members  employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating  Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Higher rates. The Sponsoring Agency may choose to pay Affiliated  Personnel at a higher rate, but DHS will not reimburse the increment  above the maximum rate specified in the Maximum Pay Rate Table.  Likewise, the Sponsoring Agency may choose to enter into a Participating  Agency agreement with the individual's employer, rather than use the  individual as an Affiliated Personnel, in which case the Maximum Pay  Rate Table would not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Compensation for Sponsoring Agency employees serving as  Affiliated Personnel. An employee of a Sponsoring Agency serving on a  Task Force in a capacity other than his or her normal job, e.g., a fire  department dispatcher affiliated with the Task Force as a canine search  specialist, as an Affiliated Personnel, would not necessarily be subject  to the Maximum Pay Rate Table for reimbursement for salary and benefits  for that individual. However, Sponsoring Agencies may use the rates in  the Maximum Pay Rate Table as a guide for establishing compensation  levels for such individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Backfill expenses for Affiliated Personnel under Sec.  208.39(g). (i) The only way that DHS can reimburse for Backfill costs  incurred for Affiliated Personnel is through Participating Agencies. If  reimbursement for Backfill expenses is needed for Affiliated Personnel,  DHS encourages them to urge their employers or professional association  to seek Participating Agency status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Private, for-profit organizations. Participating Agency status  is available to private, for-profit organizations, e.g., HMOs or medical  or engineering professional associations, under the revised definition  of ``Participating Agency'' set forth in this Interim rule. (See  Definitions, Sec. 208.2, Participating Agency. and Sec. 208.32,  Maximum Pay Rate Tabl.e). When a for-profit Participating Agency must  backfill an Activated System Member's position we will compensate that  Participating Agency up to the maximum rate provided in the Table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Compensation costs. DHS will reimburse for-profit  organizations, for purposes of reimbursement and Backfill, for the  System Member's actual compensation or the actual compensation of the  individual who Backfills a position (which includes salary and benefits,  as described in Sec. Sec. 208.39 and 208.40), but will not reimburse  for billable or other rates that might be charged for services rendered  to commercial clients or patients.    Sec. Sec. 208.13-208.20  [Reserved]</p>
