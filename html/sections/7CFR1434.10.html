                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A producer must, unless otherwise authorized by CCC, request  loans and loan deficiency payments at the appropriate FSA county office  responsible for administering the program as provided under part 718 of  this title. To receive loans and loan deficiency payments for honey, a  producer shall execute a note and security agreement or loan deficiency  payment application on or before March 31 of the year following the year  in which the honey was extracted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A producer must request a loan at the county office of the  county where the honey is stored if the honey is stored at the  producer's farm. A producer who requests a loan on honey stored in  eligible storage other than the producer's farm, may request loans at  either the county office of the county where the storage facility is  located or at the county office of the county where the producer's main  place of business is located. A CMA must request loans at the county  office for the county in which the principal office of the CMA is  located unless the State committee designates another county office. If  the CMA has operations in two or more States, the CMA must file its loan  applications at the county office for the county in which its principal  office for each State is located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Loans will be made on the honey as declared and certified by the  producer on Form CCC-633 (Honey), (Honey Loan Certification and  Worksheet) at the time the honey is pledged as collateral for a loan.  The producer is also required to declare and certify on Form CCC-633  (Honey) the class (table or nontable) and floral source of the honey at  the time the honey is pledged as collateral for a loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The request for a loan shall not be approved until all producers  having an interest in the honey sign the note and security agreement and  CCC approves such note and security agreement. The disbursement of loans  will be made by county offices on behalf of CCC, for honey that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has been extracted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is in eligible storage; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has not been blended or mixed with ineligible honey.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Loans mature on demand but not later than the last day of the  ninth calendar month following the month in which the note and security  agreement was approved. When the final maturity date falls on a non- workday for county offices, CCC shall extend the final date to the next  workday. Before the date determined in paragraph (a) of this section, a  producer may re-offer as loan collateral any eligible honey that has  been offered previously for a CCC loan and the loan has been repaid at  principal plus interest only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If, after a loan is made, CCC determines that the producer or  the honey collateral is not in compliance with any of the provisions of  this part, the producer shall refund the total amount disbursed under  loan and charges plus interest, including late payment interest as  provided in part 1403 of this title.
