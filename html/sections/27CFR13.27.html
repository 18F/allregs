                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Form of appeal. The decision after appeal of qualification or  denial may be appealed in writing to the appropriate TTB officer within  45 days after the date of that decision. If the appropriate TTB officer  concludes that the qualified approval or denial was correct, a copy of  the application, marked ``appeal denied,'' must be returned to the  applicant, with an explanation of the decision and the specific laws or  regulations relied upon in qualifying or denying the application. If the  appropriate TTB officer concludes that the certificate of label  approval, certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive  liquor bottle application should be approved without qualification, the  applicant may resubmit TTB Form 5100.31 and the certificate will be  issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time limits for decision after second appeal. Within 90 days of  receipt of the second appeal, the appropriate TTB officer must notify  the appellant whether the appeal has been granted or denied. If an  applicant requests an informal conference as part of an appeal, as  authorized in Sec. 13.71, the 90-day period will begin 10 days after  the date of the conference to allow for consideration of any written  arguments, facts or evidence submitted after the conference. The  appropriate TTB officer may extend this period of time once, by an  additional 90 days, if he or she finds that unusual circumstances  require additional time to consider the unique issues presented by an  appeal. If the appropriate TTB officer extends the time period, he or  she must notify the applicant by letter, briefly explaining the issues  presented by the label. The decision made on the second appeal shall be  the final decision of TTB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Judicial review. An appeal to the appropriate TTB officer is  required prior to application to the Federal courts for review of any  denial or qualification of an application.  [T.D. ATF-406, 64 FR 2129, Jan. 13, 1999; T.D. ATF-406a, 64 FR 10949,  Mar. 8, 1999, as amended by T.D. ATF-449, 66 FR 19086, Apr. 13, 2001]</p>
