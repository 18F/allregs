                                Sec.  1.558  Business information.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Business information received by VA from a submitter  will be considered under the FOIA pursuant to this section and in  accordance with the requirements set forth in Sec.  1.557 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(4)</em>. The submitter may mark the  record submission as confidential or use the words ``business  information'' or describe the specific records that contain business  information. Such designation will be considered, but will not control,  the FOIA Officer's decision on disclosing the material. A designation  will remain in effect for a period of not more than 10 years after  receipt by VA, unless the submitter provides acceptable justification  for a longer period. The submitter may designate a shorter period by  including an expiration date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notices to submitters. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FOIA Officer shall promptly  notify the submitter in writing of a FOIA request seeking the  submitter's business information whenever the FOIA Officer has reason to  believe that the information may be protected under FOIA Exemption 4, 5  U.S.C. 552(b)(4), regarding business information. The written notice  will provide the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of any  specified portion of the records within the reasonable time period  specified in the notice. The notice will either describe in detail the  business information requested (e.g., an entire contract identified by a  unique number) or shall provide copies of the requested record(s) or  record portions containing the business information. When notification  of a voluminous number of submitters is required, the FOIA Officer may  notify the submitters by posting or publishing the notice in a place  reasonably likely to accomplish notification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the FOIA Officer determines to release business information  over the objection(s) of the submitter, the FOIA Officer will notify the  submitter pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whenever the FOIA Officer notifies the requester of a final  decision, the FOIA Officer will also notify the submitter by separate  correspondence. This notification may be contained in VA's FOIA  decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exceptions to this notice provision are contained in paragraph  (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Opportunity to object to disclosure. When notification to a  submitter is made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the  submitter may object to the disclosure of any specified portion(s) of  the record(s). The submitter's objection(s) must be in writing,  addressed to the FOIA Officer, and must be received by the reasonable  date specified in the FOIA Officer's notice in order for VA to consider  such objections. If the submitter has any objection to disclosure of the  record(s) requested, or any specified portion(s) thereof, the submitter  must identify the specific record(s) or portion(s) of records for which  objection(s) are made. The objection will specify in detail all grounds  for withholding any record(s) or portion(s) of the record(s) upon which  disclosure is opposed under any exemption of the FOIA. In particular, if  the submitter is asserting that the record is protected under Exemption  4, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), it must show why the information is a trade  secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or  confidential. The submitter must explain in detail how and why  disclosure of the specified records would likely cause substantial  competitive harm in the case of a required submission or state whether  the records would customarily be disclosed by the submitter upon a  request from the public in the case of a voluntary submission. The  submitter's objections must be contained within a   single written response; oral responses or subsequent, multiple  responses generally will not be considered. If the submitter does not  respond to the notice described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section  within the specified time limit, the submitter will be considered to  have no objection to disclosure of the information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Consideration of objection(s) and notice of intent to disclose.  The FOIA Officer will consider all pertinent factors, including but not  limited to the submitter's timely objection(s) to disclosure and the  specific grounds provided by the submitter for non-disclosure in  deciding whether to disclose business information. Information provided  by the submitter after the specified time limit and after the component  has made its disclosure decision generally will not be considered. In  addition to meeting the requirements of Sec.  1.557, when a FOIA Officer  decides to disclose business information over the objection of the  submitter, the FOIA Officer will provide the submitter with written  notice, which includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's  disclosure objections were not sustained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A specified disclosure date of not less than ten (10) days from  the date of the notice (to allow the submitter time to take necessary  legal action).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements set  forth in paragraphs (c) and (g) of this section will not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FOIA Officer determines that the information should not be  disclosed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information lawfully has been published or has been  officially made available to the public; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by statute, other than  the FOIA, or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements  of Executive Order 12600 or any other Executive Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice to requesters. When VA receives a request for records  that may contain confidential commercial information protected by FOIA  Exemption 4, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), regarding business information, the  requester will be notified that the request is being processed under the  provisions of this regulation and, as a consequence, there may be a  delay in receiving a response. The notice to the requester will not  include any of the specific information contained in the records being  requested.  [76 FR 51895, Aug. 19, 2011]</p>
