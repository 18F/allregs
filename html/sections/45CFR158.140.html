                                Sec. 158.140  Reimbursement for clinical services provided to enrollees.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. The report required in Sec. 158.110 must  include direct claims paid to or received by providers, including under  capitation contracts with physicians, whose services are covered by the  policy for clinical services or supplies covered by the policy. In  addition, the report must include claim reserves associated with claims  incurred during the MLR reporting year, the change in contract reserves,  reserves for contingent benefits and the medical claim portion of  lawsuits, and any incurred experience rating refunds. Reimbursement for  clinical services, as defined in this section, is referred to as  ``incurred claims.'' All components of and adjustments to incurred  claims, with the exception of contract reserves, must be calculated  based on claims incurred only during the MLR reporting year and paid  through March 31st of the following year. Contract reserves must be  calculated as of December 31st of the applicable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If there are any group conversion charges for a health plan, the  conversion charges must be subtracted from the incurred claims for the  aggregation that includes the conversion policies and this same amount  must be added to the incurred claims for the aggregation that provides  coverage that is intended to be replaced by the conversion policies. If  an issuer transfers portions of earned premium associated with group  conversion privileges between group and individual lines of business in  its Annual Statement accounting, these amounts must be added to or  subtracted from incurred claims.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Incurred claims must include the current year's unpaid claims  reserves, including claims reported in the process of adjustment,  percentage withholds from payments made to contracted providers, claims  that are recoverable for anticipated coordination of benefits (COB), and  claim recoveries received as a result of subrogation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Incurred claims must include claims incurred but not reported  based on past experience, and modified to reflect current conditions  such as changes in exposure, claim frequency or severity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Incurred claims must include changes in other claims-related  reserves.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Incurred claims must include incurred experience rating refunds  and exclude rebates paid as required by Sec. 158.240 based upon prior  MLR reporting year experience.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustments to incurred claims. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjustments that must be  deducted from incurred claims:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prescription drug rebates received by the issuer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Overpayment recoveries received from providers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Cost-sharing reduction payments received by the issuer to the  extent not reimbursed to the provider furnishing the item or service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjustments that must be included in incurred claims:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Market stabilization payments or receipts by issuers that are  directly tied to claims incurred and other claims based or census based  assessments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> State subsidies based on a stop-loss payment methodology.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of incentive and bonus payments made to providers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The amount of claims payments recovered through fraud reduction  efforts not to exceed the amount of fraud reduction expenses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adjustments that must not be included in incurred claims:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Amounts paid to third party vendors for secondary network  savings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Amounts paid to third party vendors for network development,  administrative fees, claims processing, and utilization management. For  example, if an issuer contracts with a behavioral health, chiropractic  network, or high technology radiology vendor, or a pharmacy benefit  manager, and the vendor reimburses the provider at one amount but bills  the issuer a higher amount to cover its network development, utilization  management costs, and profits, then the amount that exceeds the  reimbursement to the provider must not be included in incurred claims.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Amounts paid, including amounts paid to a provider, for  professional or administrative services that do not represent  compensation or reimbursement for covered services provided to an  enrollee. For example, medical record copying costs, attorneys' fees,  subrogation vendor fees, compensation to paraprofessionals, janitors,  quality assurance analysts, administrative supervisors, secretaries to  medical personnel and medical record clerks must not be included in  incurred claims.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Amounts paid to a provider for services that do not represent  reimbursement for covered services provided to an enrollee and are  directly covered by a student administrative health fee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Adjustments that must be either included in or deducted from  incurred claims:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Payment to and from unsubsidized State programs designed to  address distribution of health risks across issuers via charges to low  risk issuers that are distributed to high risk issuers must be included  in or deducted from incurred claims, as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Receipts related to the transitional reinsurance program and  net payments or receipts related to the risk adjustment and risk  corridors programs (calculated using an adjustment percentage, as  described in Sec. 153.500 of this subchapter, equal to zero percent)  under sections 1341, 1342, and 1343 of the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act, 42 U.S.C. 18061, 18062, 18063.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other adjustments to incurred claims:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Affiliated issuers that offer group coverage at a blended rate  may choose whether to make an adjustment to each affiliate's incurred  claims and activities to improve health care quality, to reflect the  experience of the issuer with respect to the employer as a whole,  according to an objective formula that must be defined by the issuer  prior to January 1 of the MLR reporting year, so as to result in each  affiliate having the same ratio of incurred claims to earned premium for  that employer group for the MLR reporting year as the ratio of incurred  claims to earned premium calculated for the employer group in the  aggregate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]  [75 FR 74921, Dec. 1, 2010, as amended at 75 FR 82278, Dec. 30, 2010; 77  FR 16469, Mar. 21, 2012; 77 FR 28790, May 16, 2012; 78 FR 15539, Mar.  11, 2013; 79 FR 13842, Mar. 11, 2014; 80 FR 10876, Feb. 27, 2015]</p>
