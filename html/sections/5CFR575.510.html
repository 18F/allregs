The service period must meet the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The service period must begin on the first day of a pay period and end on the last day of a pay period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The service period must not cause an employee to exceed the 5-year lifetime limitation described in Sec. 575.508.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the service requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, the service agreement may specify other terms and conditions of employment applicable to the employee.
