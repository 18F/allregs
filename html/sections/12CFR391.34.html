Following receipt of a notice from the Director of FEMA or other  provider of flood insurance that premiums are due, the State savings  association, or a servicer acting on behalf of the State savings  association, shall pay the amount owed to the insurance provider from  the escrow account by the date when such premiums are due.</p><p class="depth0">Effective Date Note: At 79 FR 75746, Dec. 19, 2014,Sec. 391.34 was  removed and reserved, effective Jan. 20, 2015.</p>
