                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition of default. (1) A party shall be found in default if it fails to respond to the complaint and notice of investigation in the manner prescribed in Sec. 210.13 or Sec. 210.59(c), or otherwise fails to answer the complaint and notice, and fails to show cause why it should not be found in default.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A party shall be found in default if it fails to respond to the complaint and notice of investigation in the manner prescribed in Sec. 210.13 or Sec. 210.59(c), or otherwise fails to answer the complaint and notice, and fails to show cause why it should not be found in default.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A party may be found in default as a sanction for abuse of process, under Sec. 210.4(c), or failure to make or cooperate in discovery, under Sec. 210.33(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure for determining default. (1)(i) If a respondent has failed to respond or appear in the manner described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a party may file a motion for, or the administrative law judge may issue upon his own initiative, an order directing respondent to show cause why it should not be found in default.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> If a respondent has failed to respond or appear in the manner described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a party may file a motion for, or the administrative law judge may issue upon his own initiative, an order directing respondent to show cause why it should not be found in default.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a respondent has failed to respond or appear in the manner described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a party may file a motion for, or the administrative law judge may issue upon his own initiative, an order directing respondent to show cause why it should not be found in default.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the respondent fails to make the necessary showing pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the administrative law judge shall issue an initial determination finding the respondent in default. An administrative law judge's decision denying a motion for a finding of default under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be in the form of an order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any party may file a motion for issuance of, or the administrative law judge may issue on his own initiative, an initial determination finding a party in default for abuse of process under Sec. 210.4(c) or failure to make or cooperate in discovery. A motion for a finding of default as a sanction for abuse of process or failure to make or cooperate in discovery shall be granted by initial determination or denied by order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a proposed respondent has not filed a response to the complaint and notice of investigation pursuant to Sec. 210.13 or Sec. 210.59(c) of this chapter, the proposed respondent may file a notice of intent to default under this section. The filing of a notice of intent to default does not require the administrative law judge to issue the show-cause order of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The administrative law judge shall issue an initial determination finding the proposed respondent in default upon the filing of a notice of intent to default. Such default will be treated in the same manner as any default under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A party found in default shall be deemed to have waived its right to appear, to be served with documents, and to contest the allegations at issue in the investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Relief against a respondent in default--(1) Types of relief available. After a respondent has been found in default by the Commission, the complainant may file with the Commission a declaration that it is seeking immediate entry of relief against the respondent in default. The facts alleged in the complaint will be presumed to be true with respect to the defaulting respondent. The Commission may issue an exclusion order, a cease and desist order, or both, affecting the defaulting respondent only after considering the effect of such order(s) upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and U.S. consumers, and concluding that the order(s) should still be issued in light of the aforementioned public interest factors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Types of relief available.
