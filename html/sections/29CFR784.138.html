                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Activities performed after conversion of an aquatic product to a  nonperishable state cannot form the basis for application of the section  13(b)(4) exemption unless the subsequent operation is so integrated with  the performance of exempt operations on the aquatic forms of animal and  vegetable life mentioned in the section that functionally and as a  practical matter it must be considered a part of the operations for  which exemption was intended. The exemption is, consequently, not  available for the handling or shipping of nonperishable products by an  employer except where done as a part of named operations commenced on  the product when it was in a perishable state. Thus, employees of  dealers in or distributors of such nonperishable products as fish oil  and fish meal, or canned seafood, are not within the exemption.  Similarly, there is no basis for application of the exemption to  employees employed in further processing of or manufacturing operations  on products previously rendered nonperishable, such as refining fish oil  or handling fish meal in connection with the manufacture of feeds.  Further specific examples of application of the foregoing principle are  given in the subsequent discussion of particular operations named in  section 13(b)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(4)</em> on frozen, smoked, salted, or cured fish. The Department will  continue to follow this policy until further clarification from the  courts.</p>
