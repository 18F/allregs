                            <p class="depth0">With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Alaska's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards. The State included in the plan a regulation prohibiting idling of unattended motor vehicles. However, the plan stated that this regulation was included for informational purposes only, and was not to be considered part of the control strategy to implement the national standards for carbon monoxide. Accordingly, this regulation is not considered a part of the applicable plan.
