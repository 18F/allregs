                            <p class="depth0">With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator  approves Alaska's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the  national standards. The State included in the plan a regulation  prohibiting idling of unattended motor vehicles. However, the plan  stated that this regulation was included for informational purposes  only, and was not to be considered part of the control strategy to  implement the national standards for carbon monoxide. Accordingly, this  regulation is not considered a part of the applicable plan.  [37 FR 15080, July 27, 1972]</p>
