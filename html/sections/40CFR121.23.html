Interested  parties shall be provided an opportunity to comment on such request in  such manner as the Regional Administrator deems appropriate. All  interested and affected parties will be given reasonable opportunity to  present evidence and testimony at a public hearing on the question  whether to grant or deny certification if the Regional Administrator  determines that such a hearing is necessary or appropriate.</p>
