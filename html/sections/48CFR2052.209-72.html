                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed at 2009.570-5(a) and 2009.570-8, the contracting  officer must insert the following clause in all applicable  solicitations, contracts, and simplified acquisitions of the types  described; 2009.570-4(b):</p><p class="depth0">Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest (JAN 1993)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in  ensuring that the contractor:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is not placed in a conflicting role because of current or  planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise)  which relate to the work under this contract; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other  parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. The restrictions described apply to performance or  participation by the contractor, as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2 in the  activities covered by this clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Work for others. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this  contract, during the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to  forego entering into consulting or other contractual arrangements with  any firm or organization the result of which may give rise to a conflict  of interest with respect to the work being performed under this  contract. The contractor shall ensure that all employees under this  contract abide by the provision of this clause. If the contractor has  reason to believe, with respect to itself or any employee, that any  proposed consultant or other contractual arrangement with any firm or  organization may involve a potential conflict of interest, the  contractor shall obtain the written approval of the contracting officer  before the execution of such contractual arrangement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contractor may not represent, assist, or otherwise support  an NRC licensee or applicant undergoing an NRC audit, inspection, or  review where the activities that are the subject of the audit,  inspection, or review are the same as or substantially similar to the  services within the scope of this contract (or task order as  appropriate) except where the NRC licensee or applicant requires the  contractor's support to explain or defend the contractor's prior work  for the utility or other entity which NRC questions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this  contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site, the contractor shall  neither solicit nor perform work in the same or similar technical area  for that licensee or applicant organization for a period commencing with  the award of the task order or beginning of work on the site (if not a  task order contract) and ending one year after completion of all work  under the associated task order, or last time at the site (if not a task  order contract).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this  contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The contractor may not solicit work at that site for that  licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order  or the contract, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The contractor may not perform work at that site for that  licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order  or the contract, as appropriate, and for one year thereafter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contracting officer may  authorize the contractor to solicit or perform this type of work (except  work in the same or similar technical area) if the contracting officer  determines that the situation will not pose a potential for technical  bias or unfair competitive advantage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disclosure after award. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contractor warrants that to the  best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise set forth in  this contract, that it does not have any organizational conflicts of  interest as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contractor agrees that if, after award, it discovers  organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this contract, it  shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the  contracting officer. This statement must include a description of the  action which the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or  mitigate such conflicts. The NRC may, however, terminate the contract if  termination is in the best interest of the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>  or (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Access to and use of information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, in the performance of  this contract, the contractor obtains access to information, such as NRC  plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, internal data  protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or  the Freedom of Information Act (5   U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), the contractor agrees not to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use this information for any private purpose until the  information has been released to the public;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Compete for work for the Commission based on the information  for a period of six months after either the completion of this contract  or the release of the information to the public, whichever is first;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government based on the  information until one year after the release of the information to the  public; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Release the information without prior written approval by the  contracting officer unless the information has previously been released  to the public by the NRC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition, the contractor agrees that, to the extent it  receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the  Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of  Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), or other confidential or  privileged technical, business, or financial information under this  contract, the contractor shall treat the information in accordance with  restrictions placed on use of the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subject to patent and security provisions of this contract, the  contractor shall have the right to use technical data it produces under  this contract for private purposes provided that all requirements of  this contract have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subcontracts. Except as provided in 48 CFR 2009.570-2, the  contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph, in  subcontracts of any tier. The terms contract, contractor, and  contracting officer, must be appropriately modified to preserve the  Government's rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Remedies. For breach of any of the above restrictions, or for  intentional nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant interest  required to be disclosed concerning this contract or for such erroneous  representations that necessarily imply bad faith, the Government may  terminate the contract for default, disqualify the contractor from  subsequent contractual efforts, and pursue other remedies permitted by  law or this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Waiver. A request for waiver under this clause must be directed  in writing to the contracting officer in accordance with the procedures  outlined in 48 CFR 2009.570-9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Follow-on effort. The contractor shall be ineligible to  participate in NRC contracts, subcontracts, or proposals therefor  (solicited or unsolicited) which stem directly from the contractor's  performance of work under this contract. Furthermore, unless so directed  in writing by the contracting officer, the contractor may not perform  any technical consulting or management support services work or  evaluation activities under this contract on any of its products or  services or the products or services of another firm if the contractor  has been substantially involved in the development or marketing of the  products or services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the contractor under this contract, prepares a complete or  essentially complete statement of work or specifications, the contractor  is not eligible to perform or participate in the initial contractual  effort which is based on the statement of work or specifications. The  contractor may not incorporate its products or services in the statement  of work or specifications unless so directed in writing by the  contracting officer, in which case the restrictions in this paragraph do  not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nothing in this paragraph precludes the contractor from offering  or selling its standard commercial items to the Government.</p><p class="depth3">(End of clause)</p>
