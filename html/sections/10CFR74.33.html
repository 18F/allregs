                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General performance objectives. Each licensee who is authorized  by this chapter to possess equipment capable of enriching uranium or  operate an enrichment facility, and produce, possess, or use more than  one effective kilogram of special nuclear material of low strategic  significance at any site or contiguous sites, subject to control by the  licensee, shall establish, implement, and maintain a NRC-approved  material control and accounting system that will achieve the following  objectives:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintain accurate, current, and reliable information of and  periodically confirm the quantities and locations of source material and  special nuclear material in the licensee's possession;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Protect against and detect production of uranium enriched to 10  percent or more in the isotope U\235\;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Protect against and detect unauthorized production of uranium of  low strategic significance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Resolve indications of missing uranium;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Resolve indications of production of uranium enriched to 10  percent or more in the isotope U\235\ (for centrifuge enrichment  facilities this requirement does not apply to each cascade during its  start-up process, not to exceed the first 24 hours);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Resolve indications of unauthorized production of uranium of low  strategic significance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Provide information to aid in the investigation of missing  uranium;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Provide information to aid in the investigation of the  production of uranium enriched to 10 percent or more in the isotope  U\235\; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Provide information to aid in the investigation of unauthorized  production of uranium of low strategic significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Implementation dates. Each applicant for a license who would,  upon issuance of a license pursuant to any part of this chapter, be  subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submit a fundamental nuclear material control plan describing  how the performance objectives of Sec. 74.33(a), the system features  and capabilities of Sec. 74.33(c), and the recordkeeping requirements  of Sec. 74.33(d) will be met; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Implement the NRC approved plan submitted pursuant to paragraph  (b)(1) of this section prior to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The cumulative receipt of 5,000 grams of U\235\ contained in any  combination of natural, depleted, or enriched uranium or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> NRC's issuance of a license to test or operate the enrichment  facility; whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> (1) through (8) of this  section. The licensee shall establish, document, and maintain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A management structure that ensures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Clear overall responsibility for MC&A; functions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Independence of MC&A; management from production  responsibilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Separation of key MC&A; responsibilities from each other; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Use of approved written MC&A; procedures and periodic review of  those procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A measurement program that ensures that all quantities of source  material and special nuclear material in the accounting records are  based on measured values;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A measurement control program that ensures that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Measurement bias is estimated and minimized through the  measurement control program, and any significant biases are eliminated  from inventory difference values of record;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All MC&A; measurement systems are controlled so that twice the  standard error of the inventory difference, based on all measurement  error contributions, is less than the greater of 5,000 grams of U\235\  or 0.25 percent of the U\235\ of the active inventory for each total  plant material balance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any measurements performed under contract are controlled so  that the licensee can satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) (i)  and (ii) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A physical inventory program that provides for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Performing, unless otherwise required to satisfy part 75 of this  chapter, a dynamic (nonshutdown) physical inventory of in-process (e.g.,  in the enrichment equipment) uranium and U\235\ at least every 65 days,  and performing a static physical inventory of all other uranium and  total U\235\ contained in natural, depleted, and enriched uranium  located outside of the enrichment processing equipment at least every  370 calendar days, with static physical inventories being conducted in  conjunction with a dynamic physical inventory of in-process uranium and  U\235\ so as to provide a total plant material balance at least every  370 calendar days; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reconciling and adjusting the book inventory to the results of  the static physical inventory and resolving, or reporting an inability  to resolve, any inventory difference that is rejected by a statistical  test which has a 90 percent power of detecting a discrepancy of a  quantity of U\235\, established by NRC on a site-specific basis, within  60 days after the start of each static physical inventory;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A detection program, independent of production, that provides  high assurance of detecting:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Production of uranium enriched to 10 percent or more in the  U\235\ isotope, to the extent that SNM of moderate strategic  significance could be produced within any 370 calendar day period;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Production of uranium enriched to 20 percent or more in the  U\235\ isotope; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unauthorized production of uranium of low strategic  significance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An item control program that ensures that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Current knowledge is maintained of items with respect to  identity, uranium and U\235\ content, and stored location; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this  section are licensed-identified items each containing less than 500  grams U\235\ up to a cumulative total of 50 kilograms of U\235\ and  items that exist for less than 14 calendar days;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A resolution program that ensures that any shipper-receiver  differences are resolved that are statistically significant and exceed  500 grams U\235\ on:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An individual batch basis; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A total shipment basis for all source material and special  nuclear material;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> An assessment program that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Independently assesses the effectiveness of the MC&A; system at  least every 24 months;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Documents the results of the above assessment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Documents management's findings on whether the MC&A; system is  currently effective; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Documents any actions taken on recommendations from prior  assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recordkeeping. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each licensee shall establish records that  will demonstrate that the performance objectives of paragraph (a) of  this section and the system features and capabilities of paragraph (c)  of this section have been met and maintain these records in an auditable  form, available for inspection, for at least 3 years, unless a longer  retention time is required by part 75 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records that must be maintained pursuant to this part may be the  original or a reproduced copy or a microform if such reproduced copy or  microform is duly authenticated by authorized personnel and the  microform is capable of producing a clear and legible copy after storage  for the period specified by Commission regulations. The record may also  be stored in electronic media with the capability for producing, on  demand, legible, accurate, and complete records during the required  retention period. Records such as letters, drawings, and specifications  must include all pertinent information such as stamps, initials, and  signatures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The licensee shall maintain adequate safeguards against  tampering with and loss of records.
