                                Sec. 1.467-1  Treatment of lessors and lessees generally.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. When applicable, section 467 requires  a lessor   and lessee of tangible property to treat rents consistently and to use  the accrual method of accounting (and time value of money principles)  regardless of their overall method of accounting. In addition, in  certain cases involving tax avoidance, the lessor and lessee must take  rent and stated or imputed interest into account under a constant rental  accrual method, pursuant to which the rent is treated as accruing  ratably over the entire lease term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cases in which rules are inapplicable. Section 467 applies only  to leases (or other similar arrangements) that constitute section 467  rental agreements as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. For  example, a rental agreement is not a section 467 rental agreement, and,  therefore, is not subject to the provisions of this section and  Secs. 1.467-2 through 1.467-9 (the section 467 regulations), if it  specifies equal amounts of rent for each month throughout the lease term  and all payments of rent are due in the calendar year to which the rent  relates (or in the preceding or succeeding calendar year). In addition,  the section 467 regulations do not apply to a rental agreement that  requires total rents of $250,000 or less. For purposes of determining  whether the agreement has total rents of $250,000 or less, certain  specified contingent rent is disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Summary of rules--(i) Basic rules. Paragraph (c) of this section  provides rules for determining whether a rental agreement is a section  467 rental agreement. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section provide  rules for determining the amount of rent and interest, respectively,  required to be taken into account by a lessor and lessee under a section  467 rental agreement. Paragraphs (f) through (h) and (j) of this section  provide various definitions and special rules relating to the  application of the section 467 regulations. Paragraph </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this  section is reserved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules. Section 1.467-2 provides rules for section 467  rental agreements that have deferred or prepaid rents without providing  for adequate interest. Section 1.467-3 provides rules for application of  the constant rental accrual method, including criteria for determining  whether an agreement is subject to this method. Section 1.467-4 provides  rules for establishing and adjusting a section 467 loan (the amount that  a lessor is deemed to have loaned to the lessee, or vice versa, pursuant  to the application of the section 467 regulations). Section 1.467-5  provides rules for applying the section 467 regulations where a rental  agreement requires payments of interest at a variable rate. Section  1.467-6, relating to the treatment of certain section 467 rental  agreements with contingent payments, is reserved. Section 1.467-7  provides rules for the treatment of dispositions by a lessor of property  subject to a section 467 rental agreement and the treatment of  assignments by lessees and certain lessee-financed renewals of a section  467 rental agreement. Section 1.467-7 also provides rules for the  treatment of modified rental agreements. Section 1.467-8 provides  special transitional rules relating to the method of accounting for  certain rental agreements entered into on or before May 18, 1999.  Finally, Sec. 1.467-9 provides the effective date rules for the section  467 regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Scope of rules. No inference should be drawn from any provision  of this section or Secs. 1.467-2 through 1.467-9 concerning whether--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For Federal tax purposes, an arrangement constitutes a lease; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For Federal tax purposes, any obligation of the lessee under a  rental agreement is treated as rent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Application of other authorities. Notwithstanding section 467  and the regulations thereunder, other authorities such as section 446(b)  clear-reflection-of-income principles, section 482, and the substance- over-form doctrine, may be applied by the Commissioner to determine the  income and expense from a rental agreement (including the proper  allocation of fixed rent under a rental agreement).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Method of accounting for section 467 rental agreements. If a  rental agreement is a section 467 rental agreement, as described in  paragraph (c) of this section, the lessor and lessee must each take into  account for any taxable year the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The section 467 rent for the taxable year (as defined in  paragraph (d) of this section); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The section 467 interest for the taxable year (as defined in  paragraph (e) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Section 467 rental agreements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as  otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the term section  467 rental agreement means a rental agreement, as defined in paragraph  (h)(12) of this section, that has increasing or decreasing rents (as  described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section), or deferred or prepaid  rents (as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Increasing or decreasing rent--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Fixed rent--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A  rental agreement has increasing or decreasing rent if the annualized  fixed rent, as described in paragraph (j)(3) of this section, allocated  to any rental period exceeds the annualized fixed rent allocated to any  other rental period in the lease term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Certain rent holidays disregarded. Notwithstanding the  provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, a rental agreement  does not have increasing or decreasing rent if the increasing or  decreasing rent is solely attributable to a rent holiday provision  allowing reduced rent (or no rent) for a period of three months or less  at the beginning of the lease term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(2)</em> of  this section, the amount of fixed rent allocated to each rental period  during the lease term is the amount of fixed rent allocated to that  period by the rental agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rental agreements specifically allocating fixed rent. A rental  agreement specifically allocates fixed rent if the rental agreement  unambiguously specifies, for periods no longer than a year, a fixed  amount of rent for which the lessee becomes liable on account of the use  of the property during that period, and the total amount of fixed rent  specified is equal to the total amount of fixed rent payable under the  lease. For example, a rental agreement providing that rent is $100,000  per calendar year, and providing for total payments of fixed rent equal  to the total amount specified, specifically allocates rent. A rental  agreement stating only when rent is payable does not specifically  allocate rent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> No specific allocation. If a rental agreement does not provide a  specific allocation of fixed rent (for example, because the total amount  of fixed rent specified is not equal to the total amount of fixed rent  payable under the lease), the amount of fixed rent allocated to a rental  period is the amount of fixed rent payable during that rental period. If  an amount of fixed rent is payable before the beginning of the lease  term, it is allocated to the first rental period in the lease term. If  an amount of fixed rent is payable after the end of the lease term, it  is allocated to the last rental period in the lease term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Contingent rent--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A rental agreement has  increasing or decreasing rent if it requires (or may require) the  payment of contingent rent (as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this  section), other than contingent rent described in paragraph  (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Certain contingent rent disregarded. For purposes of this  paragraph (c)(2)(iii), rent is disregarded to the extent it is  contingent as the result of one or more of the following provisions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A qualified percentage rents provision, as defined in paragraph  (h)(8) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An adjustment based on a reasonable price index, as defined in  paragraph (h)(10) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A provision requiring the lessee to pay third-party costs, as  defined in paragraph (h)(15) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A loss payment provision, as defined in paragraph (h)(7) of this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A qualified TRAC provision, as defined in paragraph (h)(9) of  this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A residual condition provision, as defined in paragraph (h)(13)  of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A tax indemnity provision, as defined in paragraph (h)(14) of  this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A variable interest rate provision, as defined in paragraph  (h)(16) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Any other provision provided in regulations or other published  guidance issued by the Commissioner, but only if the provision is  designated as contingent rent to be disregarded for purposes of this  paragraph (c)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deferred or prepaid rent--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Deferred rent. A rental agreement  has deferred rent under this paragraph (c)(3) if the cumulative amount  of rent allocated as of the close of a calendar year (determined under  paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section) exceeds the cumulative amount of  rent payable as of the close of the succeeding calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prepaid rent. A rental agreement has prepaid rent under this  paragraph (c)(3) if the cumulative amount of rent payable as of the  close of a calendar year exceeds the cumulative amount of rent allocated  as of the close of the succeeding calendar year (determined under  paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rent allocated to a calendar year. For purposes of this  paragraph (c)(3), the rent allocated to a calendar year is the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The fixed rent allocated to any rental period (determined under  paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) that begins and ends in the  calendar year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A ratable portion of the fixed rent allocated to any other  rental period that begins or ends in the calendar year; and (C) Any  contingent rent that accrues during the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (c)(3):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, a rental agreement  has deferred rent if, at the close of a calendar year, the cumulative  amount of rent allocated under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section  exceeds the cumulative amount of rent payable as of the close of the  succeeding year. In this example, there is no deferred rent: the rent  allocated to 2000 ($100,000) does not exceed the cumulative rent payable  as of December 31, 2001 ($100,000); the rent allocated to 2001 and  preceding years ($200,000) does not exceed the cumulative rent payable  as of December 31, 2002 ($200,000); the rent allocated to 2002 and  preceding years ($300,000) does not exceed the cumulative rent payable  as of December 31, 2003 ($400,000); and the rent allocated to 2003 and  preceding years ($400,000) does not exceed the cumulative rent payable  as of December 31, 2004 ($400,000). Therefore, because the rental  agreement does not have increasing or decreasing rent and does not have  deferred or prepaid rent, the rental agreement is not a section 467  rental agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A and B enter into a rental agreement that provides  for a 10-year lease of personal property, beginning on January 1, 2000,  and ending on December 31, 2009. The rental agreement provides for  accruals of rent of $10,000 during each month of the lease term. Under  paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, $120,000 is allocated to each  calendar year. The rental agreement provides for a $1,200,000 payment on  December 31, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of  this section because the cumulative amount of rent payable as of the  close of a calendar year exceeds the cumulative amount of rent allocated  as of the close of the succeeding calendar year. For example, the  cumulative amount of rent payable as of the close of 2000 ($1,200,000 is  payable on December 31, 2000) exceeds the cumulative amount of rent  allocated as of the close of 2001, the succeeding calendar year  ($240,000). Accordingly, the rental agreement is a section 467 rental  agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rental agreements involving total payments of $250,000 or less-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A rental agreement is not a section 467 rental agreement  if, as of the agreement date (as defined in paragraph (h)(1) of this  section), it is not reasonably expected that the sum of the aggregate  amount of rental payments under the rental agreement and the aggregate  value of all other consideration to be received for the use of property  (taking into account any payments of contingent rent, and any   other contingent consideration) will exceed $250,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules in computing amount described in paragraph  (c)(4)(i) of this section of this section. The following rules apply in  determining the amount described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Stated interest on deferred rent is not taken into account.  However, the Commissioner may recharacterize a portion of stated  interest as additional rent if a rental agreement provides for interest  on deferred rent at a rate that, in light of all of the facts and  circumstances, is clearly greater than the arm's-length rate of interest  that would have been charged in a lending transaction between the lessor  and lessee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Consideration that does not involve a cash payment is taken into  account at its fair market value. A liability that is either assumed or  secured by property acquired subject to the liability is taken into  account at the sum of its remaining principal amount and accrued  interest (if any) thereon or, in the case of an obligation originally  issued at a discount, at the sum of its adjusted issue price and accrued  qualified stated interest (if any), within the meaning of Sec. 1.1273- 1(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> All rental agreements that are part of the same transaction or a  series of related transactions involving the same lessee (or any related  person) and the same lessor (or any related person) are treated as a  single rental agreement. Whether two or more rental agreements are part  of the same transaction or a series of related transactions depends on  all the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If an agreement includes a provision increasing or decreasing  rent payable solely as a result of an adjustment based on a reasonable  price index, the amount described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section  must be determined as if the applicable price index did not change  during the lease term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If an agreement includes a variable interest rate provision (as  defined in paragraph (h)(16) of this section), the amount described in  paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section must be determined by using fixed  rate substitutes (determined in the same manner as under Sec. 1.1275- 5(e), treating the agreement date as the issue date) for the variable  rates of interest applicable to the lessor's indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Contingent rent described in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(B)(3)  through (8) of this section is not taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Section 467 rent--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The section 467 rent for a  taxable year is the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The fixed rent for any rental period (determined under paragraph  (d)(2) of this section) that begins and ends in the taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A ratable portion of the fixed rent for any other rental period  beginning or ending in the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a section 467 rental agreement that provides  for contingent rent, the contingent rent that accrues during the taxable  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fixed rent for a rental period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Constant rental accrual. In  the case of a section 467 rental agreement that is a disqualified  leaseback or long-term agreement (as described in Sec. 1.467-3(b)), the  fixed rent for a rental period is the constant rental amount (as  determined under Sec. 1.467-3(d)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Proportional rental accrual. In the case of a section 467  rental agreement that is not described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this  section, and does not provide adequate interest on fixed rent (as  determined under Sec. 1.467-2(b)), the fixed rent for a rental period is  the proportional rental amount (as determined under Sec. 1.467-2(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Section 467 rental agreement accrual. In the case of a section  467 rental agreement that is not described in either paragraph (d)(2)(i)  or (ii) of this section, the fixed rent for a rental period is the  amount of fixed rent allocated to the rental period under the rental  agreement, as determined under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Section 467 interest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The section 467 interest  for a taxable year is the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The interest on fixed rent for any rental period that begins and  ends in the taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A ratable portion of the interest on fixed rent for any other  rental period beginning or ending in the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a section 467 rental agreement that provides  for contingent rent, any interest that accrues on the contingent rent  during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest on fixed rent for a rental period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section and  Sec. 1.467-5(b)(1)(ii), the interest on fixed rent for a rental period  is equal to the product of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The principal balance of the section 467 loan (as described in  Sec. 1.467-4(b)) at the beginning of the rental period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The yield of the section 467 loan (as described in Sec. 1.467- 4(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> (agreements with  adequate interest stated at a single fixed rate), the interest on fixed  rent for a rental period is the amount of interest provided in the  rental agreement for the period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Treatment of interest. If the section 467 interest for a rental  period is a positive amount, the lessor has interest income and the  lessee has an interest expense. If the section 467 interest for a rental  period is a negative amount, the lessee has interest income and the  lessor has an interest expense. Section 467 interest is treated as  interest for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Substantial modification of a rental agreement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treatment as  new agreement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a substantial modification of a rental  agreement occurs after June 3, 1996, the post-modification agreement is  treated as a new agreement and the date on which the modification occurs  is treated as the agreement date in applying section 467 and the  regulations thereunder to the post-modification agreement. Thus, for  example, the post-modification agreement is treated as a new agreement  entered into on the date the modification occurs for purposes of  determining whether it is a section 467 rental agreement under this  section, whether it is a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement  under Sec. 1.467-3, and whether it is entered into after the applicable  effective date in Sec. 1.467-9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitation. In the case of a substantial modification of a  rental agreement occurring on or before May 18, 1999, this paragraph (f)  applies only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The rental agreement was a disqualified leaseback or long-term  agreement before the modification and the agreement date, determined  without regard to the modification, is after June 3, 1996; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The post-modification agreement would, after application of the  rules in this paragraph (f) (other than the special rule for  disqualified agreements in paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section), be a  disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Post-modification agreement; in general. For purposes of  determining whether a post-modification agreement is a section 467  rental agreement or a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement  under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the terms of the post- modification agreement are, except as provided in paragraph (f)(4) of  this section, only those terms that provide for rights and obligations  relating to post-modification items (within the meaning of paragraph  (f)(5)(iv) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other effects of a modification. For rules relating to amounts  that must be taken into account following certain modifications, see  Sec. 1.467-7(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Carryover of character; leasebacks. If an  agreement is a leaseback prior to its modification and the lessee prior  to the modification (or a related person) is the lessee after the  modification, the post-modification agreement is a leaseback even if the  post-modification lessee did not have an interest in the property at any  time during the two-year period ending on the date on which the  modification occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Carryover of character; long-term agreements. If an agreement  is a long-term agreement prior to its modification and the entire  agreement (as modified) would be a long-term agreement, the post- modification agreement is a long-term agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Carryover of character; disqualified agreements. If an  agreement (as in effect before its modification) is a disqualified  leaseback or long-term agreement as the result of a determination  (whether occurring before or after the modification) under Sec. 1.467- 3(b)(1)(ii) and the post-modification agreement is a section 467 rental  agreement (or the entire agreement (as modified) would be a section 467  rental agreement), the post-modification agreement will, notwithstanding  its treatment as a new agreement under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this  section, be subject to constant rental accrual unless the Commissioner  determines that, because of the absence of tax avoidance potential, the  post-modification agreement should not be treated as a disqualified  leaseback or long-term agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Allocation of rent. If the entire agreement (as modified)  provides a specific allocation of fixed rent, as described in paragraph  (c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) of this section, the post-modification agreement is  treated as an agreement that provides a specific allocation of fixed  rent. If the entire agreement (as modified) does not provide a specific  allocation of fixed rent, the fixed rent allocated to rental periods  during the lease term of the post-modification agreement is determined  by applying the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section to the  entire agreement (as modified).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Difference between aggregate rent and interest and aggregate  payments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(v)(B)  of this section, a post-modification agreement described in paragraph  (f)(4)(v)(C) of this section is treated as a section 467 rental  agreement subject to proportional rental accrual (determined under  Sec. 1.467-2(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Constant rental accrual prior to the modification. A post- modification agreement described in paragraph (f)(4)(v)(C) of this  section is treated as a section 467 rental agreement subject to constant  rental accrual if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Constant rental accrual is required under paragraph (f)(4)(iii)  of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The post-modification agreement involves total payments of more  than $250,000 (as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section), and  the Commissioner determines that the post-modification agreement is a  disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> if  the aggregate amount of fixed rent and stated interest treated as post- modification items does not equal the aggregate amount of payments  treated as post-modification items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Principal purpose of tax avoidance. If a principal purpose of a  substantial modification is to avoid the purpose or intent of section  467 or the regulations thereunder, the Commissioner may treat the entire  agreement (as modified) as a single agreement for purposes of section  467 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of  this paragraph (f) and Sec. 1.467-7(g):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A modification of a rental agreement is any alteration,  including any deletion or addition, in whole or in part, of a legal  right or obligation of the lessor or lessee thereunder, whether the  alteration is evidenced by an express agreement (oral or written),  conduct of the parties, or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A modification is substantial only if, based on all of the  facts and circumstances, the legal rights or obligations that are  altered and the degree to which they are altered are economically  substantial. A modification of a rental agreement will not be treated as  substantial solely because it is not described in paragraph (f)(6) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A modification occurs on the earlier of the first date on  which there is a binding contract that substantially sets forth the  terms of the modification or the date on which agreement to such terms  is otherwise evidenced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Post-modification items with respect to any modification of a  rental agreement are all items (other than pre-modification items)  provided under the terms of the entire agreement (as modified).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Pre-modification items with respect to any modification of a  rental agreement are pre-modification rent, interest thereon, and  payments allocable thereto (whether payable before or   after the modification.) For this purpose--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Pre-modification rent is rent allocable to periods before the  effective date of the modification, but only to the extent such rent is  payable under the entire agreement (as modified) at the time such rent  was due under the agreement in effect before the modification; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pre-modification items are identified by applying payments, in  the order payable under the entire agreement (as modified) unless the  agreement specifies otherwise, to rent and interest thereon in the order  in which amounts accrue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The entire agreement (as modified) with respect to any  modification is the agreement consisting of pre-modification terms  providing for rights and obligations that are not affected by the  modification and post-modification terms providing for rights and  obligations that differ from the rights and obligations under the  agreement in effect before the modification. For example, if a 10-year  rental agreement that provides for rent of $25,000 per year is modified  at the end of the 5th year to provide for rent of $30,000 per year in  subsequent years, the entire agreement (as modified) provides for a 10- year lease term and provides for rent of $25,000 per year in years 1  through 5 and rent of $30,000 per year in years 6 through 10. The result  would be the same if the modification provided for both the increase in  rent and the substitution of a new lessee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Safe harbors. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f)(5)  of this section, a modification of a rental agreement is not a  substantial modification if the modification occurs solely as the result  of one or more of the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The refinancing of any indebtedness incurred by the lessor to  acquire the property subject to the rental agreement and secured by such  property (or any refinancing thereof) but only if all of the following  conditions are met--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Neither the amount, nor the time for payment, of the principal  amount of the new indebtedness differs from the amount and time for  payment of the remaining principal amount of the refinanced  indebtedness, except for de minimis changes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For each of the remaining rental periods, the rent allocation  schedule, the payments of rent and interest, and the amount accrued  under section 467 are changed only to the extent necessary to take into  account the change in financing costs, and such changes are made  pursuant to the terms of the rental agreement in effect before the  modification;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The lessor and the lessee are not related persons to each other  or to any lender to the lessor with respect to the property (whether  under the refinanced indebtedness or the new indebtedness); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> With respect to the indebtedness being refinanced, the lessor  was granted a unilateral option (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1001- 3(c)(3)) by the creditor to repay the refinanced indebtedness,  exercisable with or without the lessee's consent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A change in the obligation of the lessee to make any of the  contingent payments described in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(B)(3) through  (8) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A change in the amount of fixed rent allocated to a rental  period that, when combined with all previous changes in the amount of  fixed rent allocated to the rental period, does not exceed one percent  of the fixed rent allocated to that rental period prior to the  modification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Special rules for certain transfers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For  purposes of this paragraph (f), a substitution of a new lessee or a  sale, exchange, or other disposition by a lessor of property subject to  a rental agreement will not, by itself, be treated as a substantial  modification unless a principal purpose of the transaction giving rise  to the modification is the avoidance of Federal income tax. In  determining whether a principal purpose of the transaction giving rise  to the modification is the avoidance of Federal income tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The safe harbors and other principles of Sec. 1.467-3(c) are  taken into account; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Commissioner may treat the post-modification agreement as a  new   agreement or treat the entire agreement (as modified) as a single  agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph  (f)(7)(i) of this section, the continuing lessor and the new lessee (in  the case of a substitution of a new lessee) or the new lessor and the  continuing lessee (in the case of a sale, exchange, or other disposition  by a lessor of property subject to a rental agreement) may, in  appropriate cases, request the Commissioner to treat the transaction as  if it were a substantial modification in order to have the provisions of  paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section and Sec. 1.467-7(g)(1) apply to  the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Treatment of amounts payable by lessor to lessee--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Interest.  For purposes of determining present value, any amounts payable by the  lessor to the lessee as interest on prepaid rent are treated as negative  amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other amounts. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Meaning of terms. The following meanings apply for purposes of  this section and Secs. 1.467-2 through 1.467-9:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Agreement date means the earlier of the lease date or the first  date on which there is a binding written contract that substantially  sets forth the terms under which the property will be leased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contingent rent means any rent that is not fixed rent, including  any amount reflecting an adjustment based on a reasonable price index  (as defined in paragraph (h)(10) of this section) or a variable interest  rate provision (as defined in paragraph (h)(16) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fixed rent means any rent to the extent its amount and the time  at which it is required to be paid are fixed and determinable under the  terms of the rental agreement as of the lease date. The following rules  apply for the purpose of determining the extent to which rent is fixed  rent:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The possibility of a breach, default, or other early termination  of the rental agreement and any adjustments based on a reasonable price  index or a variable interest rate provision are disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rent will not fail to be treated as fixed rent merely because  of the possibility of impairment by insolvency, bankruptcy, or other  similar circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the lease term (as defined in paragraph (h)(6) of this  section) includes one or more periods as to which either the lessor or  the lessee has an option to renew or extend the term of the agreement,  rent will not fail to be treated as fixed rent merely because the option  has not been exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the lease term includes one or more periods during which a  substitute lessee or lessor may have use of the property, rent will not  fail to be treated as fixed rent merely because the contingencies  relating to the obligation of the lessee (or a related person) to make  payments in the nature of rent have not occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If either the lessor or the lessee has an unconditional option  or options, exercisable on one or more dates during the lease term,  that, if exercised, require payments of rent to be made under an  alternative payment schedule or schedules, the amount of fixed rent and  the dates on which such rent is required to be paid are determined on  the basis of the payment schedule that, as of the agreement date, is  most likely to occur. If payments of rent are made under an alternative  payment schedule that differs from the payment schedule assumed in  applying the preceding sentence, then, for purposes of paragraph (f) of  this section, the rental agreement is treated as having been modified at  the time the option to make payments on such alternative schedule is  exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Late payment charge means any amount required to be paid by the  lessee to the lessor as additional compensation for the lessee's failure  to make any payment of rent under a rental agreement when due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Lease date means the date on which the lessee first has the  right to use of the property that is the subject of the rental  agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> to any rental agreement that is described in  Sec. 1.467-9(a) and is entered into on or before March 6, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A loss payment provision means a provision that requires the  lessee to pay the lessor a sum of money (which may be either a  stipulated amount or an amount determined by reference to a formula or  other objective measure) if the property subject to the rental agreement  is lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed, or otherwise rendered unsuitable  for any use (other than for scrap purposes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A qualified percentage rents provision means a provision  pursuant to which the rent is equal to a fixed percentage of the  lessee's receipts or sales (whether or not receipts or sales are  adjusted for returned merchandise or Federal, state, or local sales  taxes), but only if the percentage does not vary throughout the lease  term. A provision will not fail to be treated as a qualified percentage  rents provision solely by reason of one or more of the following  additional terms:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Differing percentages of receipts or sales apply to different  departments or separate floors of a retail store, but only if the  percentage applicable to a particular department or floor does not vary  throughout the lease term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The percentage is applied to receipts or sales in excess of  determinable dollar amounts, but only if the determinable dollar amounts  are fixed and do not vary throughout the lease term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A qualified TRAC provision means a terminal rental adjustment  clause (as defined in section 7701(h)(3)) contained in a qualified motor  vehicle operating agreement (as defined in section 7701(h)(2)), but only  if the adjustment to the rental price is based on a reasonable estimate,  determined as of any date between the agreement date and the lease date  (or, in the event the agreement date is the same as or later than the  lease date, determined as of the agreement date), of the fair market  value of the motor vehicle (including any trailer) at the end of the  lease term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> An adjustment is based on a reasonable price index if the  adjustment reflects inflation or deflation occurring over a period  during the lease term and is determined consistently under a generally  recognized index for measuring inflation or deflation (for example, the  non-seasonally adjusted U.S. City Average All Items Consumer Price Index  for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), which is published by the Bureau of  Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor). An adjustment will not  fail to be treated as one that is based on a reasonable price index  merely because the adjustment may be limited to a fixed percentage, but  only if the parties reasonably expect, as of any date between the  agreement date and the lease date (or, in the event the agreement date  is the same as the lease date, as of such date), that the fixed  percentage will actually limit the amount of the rent payable during  less than 50 percent of the lease term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> For purposes of determining whether a section 467 rental  agreement is a leaseback within the meaning of Sec. 1.467-3(b)(2), two  persons are related persons if they are related persons within the  meaning of section 465(b)(3)(C). In all other cases, two persons are  related persons if they either have a relationship to each other that   is specified in section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1) or are related  entities within the meaning of sections 168(h)(4)(A), (B), or (C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Rental agreement includes any agreement, whether written or  oral, that provides for the use of tangible property and is treated as a  lease for Federal income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> A residual condition provision means a provision in a rental  agreement that requires a payment to be made by either the lessor or the  lessee to the other party based on the difference between the actual  condition of the property subject to the agreement, determined as of the  expiration of the lease term, and the expected condition of the property  at the expiration of the lease term, as set forth in the rental  agreement. The amount of any such payment may be determined by reference  to any objective measure relating to the use or condition of the  property, such as miles, hours or other duration of use, units of  production, or similar measure. A provision will be treated as a  residual condition provision only if the payment represents compensation  for the use of, or wear and tear on, the property in excess of, or  below, a standard set forth in the rental agreement, and the standard is  reasonably expected, as of any date between the agreement date and the  lease date (or, in the event the agreement date is the same as or later  than the lease date, as of the agreement date), to be met at the  expiration of the lease term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> A tax indemnity provision means a provision in a rental  agreement that may require the lessee to make one or more payments to  the lessor in the event that the Federal, foreign, state, or local  income tax consequences actually realized by a lessor from owning the  property subject to the rental agreement and leasing it to the lessee  differ from the consequences reasonably expected by the lessor, but only  if the differences in such consequences result from a misrepresentation,  act, or failure to act on the part of the lessee, or any other factor  not within the control of the lessor or any related person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Third-party costs include any real estate taxes, insurance  premiums, maintenance costs, and any other costs (excluding a debt  service cost) that relate to the leased property and are not within the  control of the lessor or lessee or any person related to the lessor or  lessee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> A variable interest rate provision means a provision in a  rental agreement that requires the rent payable by the lessee to the  lessor to be adjusted by the dollar amount of changes in the amount of  interest payable by the lessor on any indebtedness that was incurred to  acquire the property subject to the rental agreement (or any refinancing  thereof), but--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Only to the extent the changes are attributable to changes in  the interest rate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Only if the indebtedness provides for interest at one or more  qualified floating rates (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1275-5(b)), or  the changes are attributable to a refinancing at a fixed rate or one or  more qualified floating rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Computational rules. For purposes of this section and  Secs. 1.467-2 through 1.467-9, the following rules apply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Counting conventions. Any reasonable counting convention may be  used (for example, 30 days per month/360 days per year) to determine the  length of a rental period or to perform any computation. Rental periods  of the same descriptive length, for example annual, semiannual,  quarterly, or monthly, may be treated as being of equal length.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Conventions regarding timing of rent and payments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. For purposes of determining present values and yield only,  except as otherwise provided in this section and Secs. 1.467-2 through  1.467-8--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The rent allocated to a rental period is taken into account on  the last day of the rental period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any amount payable during the first half of the first rental  period is treated as payable on the first day of that rental period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any amount payable during the first half of any other rental  period is treated as payable on the last day of the preceding rental  period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any amount payable during the second half of a rental period is  treated   as payable on the last day of the rental period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Any amount payable at the midpoint of a rental period is  treated, in applying this paragraph (j)(2), as an amount payable during  the first half of the rental period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> to any rental agreement  that is described in Sec. 1.467-9(a) and is entered into on or before  March 6, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Annualized fixed rent. Annualized fixed rent is determined by  multiplying the fixed rent allocated to the rental period under  paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section by the number of periods of the  rental period's length in a calendar year. Thus, if the fixed rent  allocated to a rental period is $10,000 and the rental period is one  month, the annualized fixed rent for that rental period is $120,000  ($10,000 times 12).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allocation of fixed rent within a period. A rental agreement  that allocates fixed rent to any period is treated as allocating fixed  rent ratably within that period. Thus, if a rental agreement provides  that $120,000 is allocated to each calendar year in the lease term,  $10,000 of rent is allocated to each calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Rental period length. Except as provided in Sec. 1.467-3(d)(1)  (relating to agreements for which constant rental accrual is required),  rental periods may be of any length, may vary in length, and may be  different as between the lessor and the lessee as long as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The rental periods are one year or less, cover the entire lease  term, and do not overlap;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each scheduled payment under the rental agreement (other than a  payment scheduled to occur before or after the lease term) occurs within  30 days of the beginning or end of a rental period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a rental agreement that does not provide a  specific allocation of fixed rent, the rental periods selected do not  cause the agreement to be treated as a section 467 rental agreement  unless all alternative rental period schedules would result in such  treatment.
