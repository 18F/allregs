                            <p class="depth0">To obtain permission to (a) cut and remove timber, or (b) remove  timber already cut, which has been secured by an increased performance  bond as provided for in Sec. 5451.2, before payment of the first or  subsequent installments, the purchaser must obtain a payment bond in an  amount equal to one or more installment payments as determined by the  authorized officer. The payment bond may be a bond of a corporate surety  shown on the approved list issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and  executed on an approved form or negotiable securities of the United  States. The payment bond may be a bond of a corporate surety shown on  the approved list issued by the United States Treasury Department and  executed on an approved form, negotiable securities of the United  States, or any guaranteed remittance approved by the authorized officer.  If a bond of a corporate surety is used, the payment bond shall provide  that if the purchaser fails to make payment as required by Sec.  5461.2(c) of this chapter, the surety will make such payment including  any required interest to the Bureau within 60 days after demand therefor  by the Bureau. With the written approval of the authorized officer a  single blanket payment bond may be allocated to two or more contracts  with the same purchaser in the same Bureau of Land Management  administrative district. When operations cease for 60 days or more, the  amount of a payment bond may be adjusted downward to an amount equal to  the value of the timber cut. Before operations resume, a reduced bond  shall be increased to the amount of a full installment.
