                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manufacturers must submit the certification information as  required under Sec. 94.306, and end-of-year reports each year as part of  their participation in certification averaging, banking, and trading  programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quarterly reports. All entities involved in credit trades must  submit quarterly reports. The reports shall include the source or  recipient of the credits, the amount of credits involved plus remaining  balances, details regarding the pollutant, and model year as well as the  information prescribed in Sec. 94.308(c). Copies of contracts related to  credit trading must be included or supplied by the buyer, seller, and  broker, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> End-of-year reports must include the information prescribed in  Sec. 94.308(b). The report shall include a calculation of credit  balances for each family to show that the summation of the  manufacturer's use of credits results in a credit balance equal to or  greater than zero. The report shall be consistent in detail with the  information submitted under Sec. 94.306 and show how credit surpluses  were dispersed and how credit shortfalls were met on a family specific  basis. The end-of-year report shall incorporate any information  reflected in previous quarterly reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The applicable production/sales volume for quarterly and end-of- year reports must be based on the location of either the point of first  retail sale by the manufacturer or the point at which the engine is  placed into service, whichever occurs first. This is called the final  product purchase location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each quarterly and end-of-year report submitted shall include a  statement certifying to the accuracy and authenticity of the material  reported therein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requirements for submission. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Quarterly reports must be  submitted within 90 days of the end of the calendar quarter to the  Designated Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> End-of-year reports must be submitted within 120 days of the end  of the calendar year to the Designated Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure by a manufacturer participating in the averaging,  banking, or trading program to submit any quarterly or end-of-year  reports in the specified time for all engines is a violation of sections  203(a)(1) and 213 of the Clean Air Act for each engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A manufacturer generating credits for banking only who fails to  submit end-of-year reports in the applicable specified time period (120  days after the end of the calendar year) may not use or trade the  credits until such reports are received and reviewed by EPA. Use of  projected credits pending EPA review is not permitted in these  circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reporting errors. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Errors discovered by EPA or the  manufacturer in the end-of-year report, including errors in credit  calculation, may be corrected 180-days subsequent to submission of the  end-of-year report. Errors discovered by EPA after 180-days shall be  correctable if, as a result of the correction, the manufacturer's  credits are reduced. Errors in the manufacturer's favor are not  corrected if discovered after the 180-day correction period allowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error  occurred on an end-of-year report previously submitted to EPA under this  section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be  recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void. Erroneous  negative credit balances may be corrected by EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If EPA review of a manufacturer's end-of-year report indicates a  credit shortfall, the manufacturer will be permitted to purchase the  necessary credits to bring the credit balance to zero. These credits  must be supplied at the ratio of 1.1 credits for each 1.0 credit needed.  If sufficient credits are not available to bring the credit balance to  zero for the family(ies) involved, EPA may void the certificate(s) for  that family(ies) ab initio. In addition, all engines within an engine  family for which there are insufficient credits will be considered to  have violated the conditions of the certificate of conformity and  therefore are not covered by that certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If within 180 days of receipt of the manufacturer's end-of-year  report, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's  favor (that is, resulting in an increased credit balance) or if the  manufacturer discovers such an error within 180 days of EPA receipt of  the end-of-year report, the credits are restored for use by the  manufacturer.</p>
