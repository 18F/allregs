                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this part to establish regulations regarding the scope, characteristics, composition, funding, establishment, operation, adjournment, and dissolution of Restoration Advisory Boards (RABs).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose and scope of responsibilities of RABs. The purpose of a RAB is to provide:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An opportunity for stakeholder involvement in the environmental restoration process at Department of Defense (DoD) installations. Stakeholders are those parties that may be affected by environmental restoration activities at the installation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A forum for the early discussion and continued exchange of environmental restoration program information between DoD installations, regulatory agencies, tribes, and the community.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An opportunity for RAB members to review progress, participate in a dialogue with, and provide comments and advice to the installation's decision makers concerning environmental restoration matters. Installations shall give careful consideration to the comments provided by the RAB members.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A forum for addressing issues associated with environmental restoration activities under the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) at DoD installations, including activities conducted under the Military Munitions Response program (MMRP) to address unexploded ordnance, discarded military munitions, and the chemical constituents of munitions. Environmental groups or advisory boards that address issues other than environmental restoration activities are not governed by this regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. In this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Community RAB member shall mean those individuals identified by community members and appointed by the Installation Commander to participate in a RAB who live and/or work in the affected community or are affected by the installation's environmental restoration program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Environmental restoration shall include the identification, investigation, research and development, and cleanup of contamination from hazardous substances, including munitions and explosives of concern, and pollutants and contaminants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Installation shall include active and closing DoD installations and formerly used defense sites (FUDS).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Installation Commander shall include the Commanding Officer or the equivalent of a Commanding Officer at active installations; the Installation Commander or other Military Department officials who close the facility and are responsible for its disposal at Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) installations; or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Project Management District Commander at FUDS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Public participants shall include anyone else who may want to attend the RAB meetings, including those individuals that may not live and/or work in the affected community or may not be affected by the installation's environmental restoration program but would like to attend and provide comments to the RAB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Stakeholders are those parties that may be affected by environmental restoration activities at an installation, including family members of military personnel and civilian workers, local and state governments and EPA for NPL properties, tribal community members and indigenous people, and current landowners, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Tribes shall mean any Federally-recognized American Indian and Alaska Native government as defined by the most current Department of Interior/Bureau of Indian Affairs list of tribal entities published in the Federal Register pursuant to Section 104 of the Federally Recognized Tribe Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> RAB adjournment shall mean when an Installation Commander, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), state, tribes, RAB members, and the local community, as appropriate, close the RAB based on a determination that there is no longer a need for a RAB or when community interest in the RAB declines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> RAB dissolution shall mean when an Installation Commander, with the appropriate Military Component's Environmental Deputy Assistant Secretary's approval, disbands a RAB that is no longer fulfilling the intended purpose of advising and providing community input to an Installation Commander and decision makers on environmental restoration projects. Installation Commanders are expected to make every reasonable effort to ensure that a RAB performs its role as effectively as possible and a concerted attempt is made to resolve issues that affect the RAB's effectiveness. There are circumstances, however, that may prevent a RAB from operating effectively or fulfilling its intended purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other public involvement activities. A RAB should complement other community involvement efforts occurring at an installation; however, it does not

replace other types of community outreach and participation activities required by applicable laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applicability of regulations to existing RABs. The regulations in this part apply to all RABs regardless of when the RAB was established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Guidance. The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environment shall issue guidance regarding the scope, characteristics, composition, funding, establishment, operation, adjournment, and dissolution of RABs pursuant to this rule. The issuance of any such guidance shall not be a precondition to the establishment of RABs or the implementation of this part.
