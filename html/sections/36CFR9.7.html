The Secretary expressly reserves, however, the existing right to contest claims for failure to do such work in the past. No access permits will be granted solely for the purpose of performing assessment work in these units except where claimant establishes the legal necessity for such permit in order to perform work necessary to take the claim to patent, and has filed and had approved a plan of operations as provided by these regulations.
