                                Sec. 404.130  How we determine disability insured status.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. We have four different rules for determining if you are  insured for purposes of establishing a period of disability or becoming  entitled to disability insurance benefits. To have disability insured  status, you must meet one of these rules and you must be fully insured  (see Sec. 404.132 which tells when the period ends for determining the  number of quarters of coverage (QCs) you need to be fully insured).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rule I--You must meet the 20/40 requirement. You are insured in  a quarter for purposes of establishing a period of disability or  becoming entitled to disability insurance benefits if in that quarter--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You are fully insured; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You have at least 20 QCs in the 40-quarter period (see paragraph  (f) of this section) ending with that quarter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rule II--You become disabled before age 31. You are insured in a  quarter for purposes of establishing a period of disability or becoming  entitled to disability insurance benefits if in that quarter--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You have not become (or would not become) age 31;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You are fully insured; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You have QCs in at least one-half of the quarters during the  period ending with that quarter and beginning with the quarter after the  quarter you became age 21; however--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the number of quarters during this period is an odd number,  we reduce the number by one; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the period has less than 12 quarters, you must have at least  6 QCs in the 12-quarter period ending with that quarter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rule III--You had a period of disability before age 31. You are  insured in a quarter for purposes of establishing a period of disability  or becoming entitled to disability insurance benefits if in that  quarter--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You are disabled again at age 31 or later after having had a  prior period of disability established which began before age 31 and for  which you were only insured under paragraph (c) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You are fully insured and have QCs in at least one-half the  calendar quarters in the period beginning with the quarter after the  quarter you became age 21 and through the quarter in which the later  period of disability begins, up to a maximum of 20 QCs out of 40  calendar quarters; however--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the number of quarters during this period is an odd number,  we reduce the number by one;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the period has less than 12 quarters, you must have at least  6 QCs in the 12-quarter period ending with that quarter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No monthly benefits may be paid or increased under Rule III  before May 1983.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Rule IV--You are statutorily blind. You are insured in a quarter  for purposes of establishing a period of disability or becoming entitled  to disability insurance benefits if in that quarter--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You are disabled by blindness as defined in Sec. 404.1581; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You are fully insured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> How we determine the 40-quarter or other period. In determining  the 40-quarter period or other period in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of  this section, we do not count any quarter all or part of which is in a  prior period of disability established for you, unless the quarter is  the first or last quarter of this period and the quarter is a QC.  However, we will count all the quarters in the prior period of  disability established for you if by doing so you would be entitled to  benefits or the amount of the benefit would be larger.
