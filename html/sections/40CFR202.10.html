The fast dynamic response shall comply with the meter dynamic characteristics in paragraph 5.3 of the American National Standard Specification for Sound Level Meters, ANSI S1. 4-1971. This publication is available from the American National Standards Institute, Inc., 1420 Broadway, New York, New York 10018.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) means the value specified by the manufacturer as the loaded weight of a single vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Gross Combination Weight Rating (GCWR) means the value specified by the manufacturer as the loaded weight of a combination vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Highway means the streets, roads, and public ways in any State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Interstate commerce means the commerce between any place in a State and any place in another State or between places in the same State through another State, whether such commerce moves wholly by motor vehicle or partly by motor vehicle and partly by rail, express, water or air.

This publication is available from the American National Standards Institute, Inc., 1430 Broadway, New York, New York 10018. Sound level is the frequency-weighted sound pressure level obtained with the standardized dynamic characteristic ``fast'' or ``slow'' and weighting A, B, or C; unless indicated otherwise, the A-weighting is understood.
