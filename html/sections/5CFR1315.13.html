                            <p class="depth0">As provided in Sec. 1315.1(d), the provisions of this part apply to payments relating to the procurement of property and services made by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) pursuant to Section 4(h) of the Act of June 29, 1948 (15 U.S.C. 714b(h)) (``CCC Charter Act'') and payments to which producers on a farm are entitled under the terms of an agreement entered into pursuant to the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.) (``1949 Act''.) Such payments shall be subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payment standards. Payments to producers on a farm under agreements entered into under the 1949 Act and payments to vendors providing property and services under the CCC Charter Act, shall be made as close as possible to the required payment date or loan closing date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interest penalties. An interest penalty shall be paid to vendors or producers if the payment has not been made by the required payment or loan closing date. The interest penalty shall be paid:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On the amount of payment or loan due;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the period beginning on the first day beginning after the required payment or loan closing date and, except as determined appropriate by the CCC consistent with applicable law, ending on the date the amount is paid or loaned; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Out of funds available under Section 8 of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contract Disputes Act of 1978. Insofar as covered CCC payments are concerned, provisions relating to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) in Sec. 1315.10(a)(5)(i) and Sec. 1315.6(a) do not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Extended periods for payment. Notwithstanding other provisions of this part, the CCC may allow claims for such periods of time as are consistent with authorities applicable to its operations.</p>
