                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each engine family, certification emission credits (positive  or negative) are to be calculated according to the following equation  and rounded, in accordance with ASTM E29-93a, to the nearest gram. ASTM  E29-93a has been incorporated by reference. See Sec. 91.6. Consistent  units are to be used throughout the equation. The following equation is  used to determine hydrocarbon plus oxides of nitrogen credit status for  an engine family, whether generating positive credits or negative  credits:   [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  Where:  sales = the number of eligible sales tracked to the point of first</p><p class="depth2">retail sale for the given engine family during the model year.</p><p class="depth2">Annual production projections are used to project credit</p><p class="depth2">availability for initial certification.
