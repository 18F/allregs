The Commission will, within 60 days of receipt of the applicant's submissions, forward to the United States Department of the Treasury a Standard Form 1166, ``Voucher and Schedule of Payments,'' so as to have the Treasury Department issue a check in the amount awarded in the Commission's decision, unless judicial review of the award or of the underlying decision in the adjudicatory proceeding has been sought by the applicant or any other party to the adjudicatory proceeding.
