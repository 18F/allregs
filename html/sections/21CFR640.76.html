Appropriate records shall be maintained identifying the units involved, describing their disposition, explaining fully the conditions that caused the inadvertent temperature exposure, and documenting that the episode of temperature elevation did not exceed 72 hours, that the temperature did not rise to warmer than -5 [deg]C in storage, and that the plasma remained frozen solid throughout the period of elevated temperature.
