                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis of claim. An importer may make a claim for CTPA  preferential tariff treatment, including an exemption from the  merchandise processing fee, based on either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written or electronic certification, as specified in Sec.  10.3004, that is prepared by the importer, exporter, or producer of the  good; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The importer's knowledge that the good is an originating good,  including reasonable reliance on information in the importer's  possession that the good is an originating good.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Making a claim. The claim is made by including on the entry  summary, or equivalent documentation, the letters ``CO'' as a prefix to  the subheading of the HTSUS under which each qualifying good is  classified, or by the method specified for equivalent reporting via an  authorized electronic data interchange system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Corrected claim. If, after making the claim specified in  paragraph (b) of this section, the importer has reason to believe that  the claim is based on inaccurate information or is otherwise invalid,  the importer must, within 30 calendar days after the date of discovery  of the error, correct the claim and pay any duties that may be due. The  importer must submit a statement either in writing or via an authorized  electronic data interchange system to the CBP office where the original  claim was filed specifying the correction (see Sec. Sec. 10.3031 and  10.3033).</p>
