Any person desiring to  sound-record an open Commission meeting shall notify the Commission's  Secretary of his intention to do so at least 48 hours in advance of the  meeting in question. Any person desiring to photograph or videotape the  Commission's proceedings may apply to the Secretary for permission to do  so at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting in question. The  Commission's determination to permit photography or videotaping at any  meeting is confined to its exclusive discretion, and will be granted  only if such activities will not result in undue disruption of  Commission proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Suspension of open meeting. Subject to the satisfaction of any  procedural requirements which may be required by this subpart, nothing  in this subpart shall preclude the Commission from directing that the  room be cleared of spectators, temporarily or permanently, whenever it  appears that the discussion during an open Commission meeting is likely  to involve any matter described in Sec. 200.402(a) (respecting closed  meetings).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to Commission documents. Except as expressly provided,  nothing in this subpart shall authorize any person to obtain access to  any document not otherwise available to the public or not required to be  disclosed pursuant to subpart D. Access to documents considered or  mentioned at Commission meetings may only be obtained subject to the  procedures set forth in, and the provisions of, subpart D.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Access to public meetings. Any member of the public who plans to  attend a public meeting of the Commission, and who requires an auxiliary  aid such as a sign language interpreter, should contact the Commission's  Selective Placement Coordinator, Office of Personnel at (202) 272-7065  or TDD number (202) 272-2552, prior to the meeting to make the necessary  arrangements. The Selective Placement Coordinator will take all  reasonable steps to accommodate requests made in advance of the  scheduled meeting date.
