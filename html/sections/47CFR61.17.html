                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All issuing carriers that file applications for special  permission, associated documents, such as transmittal letters, requests  for special permission, and supporting information, shall file those  documents electronically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applications for special permission must contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A detailed description of the tariff publication proposed to be  put into effect;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement citing the specific rules and the grounds on which  waiver is sought;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A showing of good cause; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The appropriate Illustrative tariff pages the issuing carrier  wishes to either revise or add as new pages to its tariff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An application for special permission must be addressed to  ``Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.''  The Electronic Tariff Filing System will accept filings 24 hours a day,  seven days a week. The official filing date of a publication received by  the Electronic Tariff Filing System will be determined by the date and  time the transmission ends. If the transmission ends after the close of  a business day, as that term is defined in Sec. 1.4(e)(2) of this  chapter, the filing will be date and time stamped as of the opening of  the next business day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition, except for issuing carriers filing tariffing fees  electronically, for special permission applications requiring fees as  set forth in part 1, subpart G of this chapter, issuing carriers must  submit the original of the application letter (without attachments), FCC  Form 159, and the appropriate fee to the address set forth in Sec.  1.1105 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In addition, if an issuing carrier applies for special  permission to revise joint tariffs, the application must state that it  is filed on behalf of all carriers participating in the affected  service.

If a carrier elects to use  less than the authority granted, it must apply to the Commission for  modification of the original grant. If a carrier elects not to use the  authority granted within sixty days of its effective date, the original  grant will be automatically cancelled by the Commission.  [76 FR 43211, July 20, 2011]</p>
