                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Administration of the Whiskeytown Unit is required to be  coordinated with the other purposes of the Central Valley project and  with the purposes of the recreation area as a whole so as to provide  for: (1) Public   outdoor recreation benefits; (2) conservation of scenic, scientific,  historic, and other values contributing to public enjoyment; and (3)  such management, utilization and disposal of renewable natural resources  as in the judgment of the Secretary of the Interior will promote or is  compatible with, and does not significantly impair, public recreation  and conservation of scenic, scientific, historic, or other values  contributing to public enjoyment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary may not acquire without consent of the owner any  privately owned ``improved property'' or interests therein within the  boundaries of the unit, so long as the appropriate local zoning agency  (Shasta County), shall have in force and applicable to such property a  duly adopted, valid, zoning ordinance that is approved by the Secretary.  This suspension of the Secretary's authority to acquire ``improved  property'' without the owner's consent would automatically cease: (1) If  the property is made the subject to a variance or exception to any  applicable zoning ordinance that does not conform to the applicable  standards contained in the regulations in this part; or (2) if such  property is put to any use which does not conform to any applicable  zoning ordinance approved by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> ``Improved property'' as used in this section, means any  building or group of related buildings, the actual construction of which  was begun before February 7, 1963, together with not more than 3 acres  of land in the same ownership on which the building or group of  buildings is situated, but the Secretary may exclude from such  ``improved property'' any shore or waters, together with so much of the  land adjoining such shore or waters, as he deems necessary for public  access thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The regulations in this part specify the standards with which  local zoning ordinances for the Whiskeytown Unit must conform if the  ``improved property'' within the boundaries of that unit is to be exempt  from acquisition by condemnation. The objectives of the regulations in  this part are to: (1) Prohibit new commercial or industrial uses other  than those which the Secretary considers to be consistent with the  purposes of the act establishing the national recreation area; (2)  promote the protection and development of properties in keeping with the  purposes of that act by means of use, acreage, frontage, setback,  density, height, or other requirements; and (3) provide that the  Secretary receive notice of any variance granted under, or any exception  made to, the application of the zoning ordinance approved by him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Following promulgation of the regulations in this part in final  form, the Secretary is required to approve any zoning ordinance or any  amendment to an approved zoning ordinance submitted to him which  conforms to the standards contained in the regulations in this part in  effect at the time of adoption of the ordinance or amendment. Within 60  days following submission, the county will be notified of the  Secretary's approval or disapproval of the zoning ordinances or  amendments thereto. If more than 60 days is required the county will be  notified of the expected delay and of the additional time deemed  necessary to reach a decision. The Secretary's approval shall remain  effective so long as the zoning ordinances or amendments thereto remain  in effect as approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Nothing contained in the regulations in this part or in the  zoning ordinances or amendments adopted for the Whiskeytown Unit to  implement the regulations in this part shall preclude the Secretary from  exercising his power of condemnation at any time with respect to  property other than ``improved property'' as defined herein. Nor shall  the regulations in this part preclude the Secretary from otherwise  fulfilling the responsibilities vested in him by the act authorizing  establishment of the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation  Area, by the Act of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535, 16 U.S.C. 3), as  amended and supplemented, and such other statutory authorities relating  to the National Park System.</p>
