                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. In performing examinations, medical examiners shall consider those matters that relate to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A communicable disease of public health significance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> A physical or mental disorder and behavior associated with the disorder that may pose, or has posed, a threat to the property, safety, or welfare of the alien or others;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A physical or mental disorder and behavior associated with the disorder that may pose, or has posed, a threat to the property, safety, or welfare of the alien or others;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A history of a physical or mental disorder and behavior associated with the disorder, which behavior has posed a threat to the property, safety, or welfare of the alien or others and which behavior is likely to recur or lead to other harmful behavior;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Drug abuse or addiction; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other physical abnormality, disease, or disability serious in degree or permanent in nature amounting to a substantial departure from normal well-being.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope of all medical examinations. (1) All medical examinations will include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All medical examinations will include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A general physical examination and medical history, evaluation for tuberculosis, and serologic testing for syphilis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A physical examination and medical history for diseases specified in Sec. Sec.  34.2(b)(1), and 34.2(b)(4) through 34.2(b)(10).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The scope of the examination shall include any laboratory or additional studies that are deemed necessary, either as a result of the physical examination or pertinent information elicited from the alien's medical history, for the examining physician to reach a conclusion about the presence or absence of a physical or mental abnormality, disease, or disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional medical screening and testing for examinations performed outside the United States. (1) HHS/CDC may require additional medical screening and testing for medical examinations performed outside the United States for diseases specified in Sec. Sec.  34.2(b)(2) and 34.2(b)(3) by applying the risk-based medical and epidemiologic factors in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HHS/CDC may require additional medical screening and testing for medical examinations performed outside the United States for diseases specified in Sec. Sec.  34.2(b)(2) and 34.2(b)(3) by applying the risk-based medical and epidemiologic factors in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such examinations shall be conducted in a defined population in a geographic region or area outside the United States as determined by HHS/CDC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additional medical screening and testing shall include a medical interview, physical examination, laboratory testing, radiologic exam, or other diagnostic procedure, as determined by HHS/CDC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Additional medical screening and testing will continue until HHS/CDC

determines such screening and testing is no longer warranted based on factors such as the following: Results of disease outbreak investigations and response efforts; effectiveness of containment and control measures; and the status of an applicable determination of public health emergency of international concern declared by the Director General of the WHO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> HHS/CDC will directly provide medical examiners information pertaining to all applicable additional requirements for medical screening and testing, and will post these at the following Internet addresses: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dq/technica.htm and http://www.globalhealth.gov.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Risk-based approach. (1) HHS/CDC will use the medical and epidemiological factors listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section to determine the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HHS/CDC will use the medical and epidemiological factors listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section to determine the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether a disease as specified in Sec.  34.2(b)(3)(ii) is a communicable disease of public health significance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Which diseases in Sec. Sec.  34.2(b)(2) and (b)(3) merit additional screening and testing, and the geographic area in which HHS/CDC will require this screening.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Medical and epidemiological factors include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The seriousness of the disease's public health impact;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the emergence of the disease was unusual or unexpected;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The risk of the spread of the disease in the United States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The transmissibility and virulence of the disease;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The impact of the disease at the geographic location of medical screening; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Other specific pathogenic factors that would bear on a disease's ability to threaten the health security of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Persons subject to requirement for chest X-ray examination and serologic testing. (1) As provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, a chest x-ray examination and serologic testing for syphilis shall be required as part of the examination of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, a chest x-ray examination and serologic testing for syphilis shall be required as part of the examination of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Applicants for immigrant visas;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Students, exchange visitors, and other applicants for non-immigrant visas required by a U.S. consular authority to have a medical examination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Applicants outside the United States who apply for refugee status;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Applicants in the United States who apply for adjustment of their status under the immigration statute and regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Chest X-ray examination and serologic testing.

Serologic testing for syphilis shall not be required if the alien is under the age of 15, unless there is reason to suspect infection with syphilis. An alien, regardless of age, in the United States, who applies for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident shall not be required to have a chest x-ray examination unless their tuberculin skin test, or an equivalent test for showing an immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, is positive. HHS/CDC may authorize exceptions to the requirement for a tuberculin skin test, an equivalent test for showing an immune response to M. tuberculosis antigens, or chest x-ray examination for good cause, upon application approved by the Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens. (i) All aliens 2 years of age or older in the United States who apply for adjustment of status to permanent residents, under the immigration laws and regulations, or other aliens in the United States who are required by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to have a medical examination in connection with a determination of their admissibility, shall be required to have a tuberculin skin test or an equivalent test for showing an immune response to

Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens. Exceptions to this requirement may be authorized for good cause upon application approved by the Director. In the event of a positive tuberculin reaction, a chest X-ray examination shall be required. If the chest radiograph is consistent with tuberculosis, the alien shall be referred to the local health authority for evaluation. Evidence of this evaluation shall be provided to the civil surgeon before a medical notification may be issued.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All aliens 2 years of age or older in the United States who apply for adjustment of status to permanent residents, under the immigration laws and regulations, or other aliens in the United States who are required by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to have a medical examination in connection with a determination of their admissibility, shall be required to have a tuberculin skin test or an equivalent test for showing an immune response to
