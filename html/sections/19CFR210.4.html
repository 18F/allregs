                                Sec.  210.4  Written submissions; representations; sanctions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Caption; names of parties. The front page of every written submission filed by a party or a proposed party to an investigation or a related proceeding under this part shall contain a caption setting forth the name of the Commission, the title of the investigation or related proceeding, the docket number or investigation number, if any, assigned to the investigation or related proceeding, and in the case of a complaint, the names of the complainant and all proposed respondents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Signature. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper of a party or proposed party who is represented by an attorney in an investigation or a related proceeding under this part shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's individual name. A party or proposed party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign, or his duly authorized officer or agent shall sign, the pleading, written motion, or other paper. Each paper shall state the signer's address and telephone number, if any. Pleadings, written motions, and other papers need not be under oath or accompanied by an affidavit, except as provided in Sec.  210.12(a)(1), Sec.  210.13(b), Sec.  210.18, Sec.  210.52(d), Sec.  210.59(b), or another section of this part or by order of the administrative law judge or the Commission. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after omission of the signature is called to the attention of the submitter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Representations. By presenting to the presiding administrative law judge or the Commission (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating) a pleading, written motion, or other paper, an attorney or unrepresented party or proposed party is certifying that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of the investigation or related proceeding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Sanctions. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond (see paragraphs (d)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section and Sec.  210.25), the presiding administrative law judge or the Commission

determines that paragraph (c) of this section has been violated, the administrative law judge or the Commission may, subject to the conditions stated below and in Sec.  210.25, impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated paragraph (c) or are responsible for the violation. A representation need not be frivolous in its entirety in order for the administrative law judge or the Commission to determine that paragraph (c) has been violated. If any portion of a representation is found to be false, frivolous, misleading, or otherwise in violation of paragraph (c), a sanction may be imposed. In determining whether paragraph (c) has been violated, the administrative law judge or the Commission will consider whether the representation or disputed portion thereof was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> How initiated--(i) By motion. A motion for sanctions under this section shall be made separately from other motions or requests and shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate paragraph (c). It shall be served as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, but shall not be filed with or presented to the presiding administrative law judge or the Commission unless, within seven days after service of the motion (or such other period as the administrative law judge or the Commission may prescribe), the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected. See also Sec.  210.25 (a) through (c). If warranted, the administrative law judge or the Commission may award to the party or proposed party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred in presenting or opposing the motion. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible for violations committed by its partners, associates, and employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On the administrative law judge's or the Commission's initiative. The administrative law judge or the Commission may enter an order sua sponte describing the specific conduct that appears to violate paragraph (c) of this section and directing an attorney, law firm, party, or proposed party to show cause why it has not violated paragraph (c) with respect thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nature of sanctions; limitations. A sanction imposed for violation of paragraph (c) of this section shall be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. Subject to the limitations in paragraphs (d)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section, the sanction may consist of, or include, directives of a nonmonetary nature, an order to pay a penalty, or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of some or all of the reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Monetary sanctions shall not be imposed under this section against the United States, the Commission, or a Commission investigative attorney.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Monetary sanctions may not be awarded against a represented party or proposed party for a violation of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Monetary sanctions may not be imposed on the administrative law judge's or the Commission's initiative unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Commission or the administrative law judge issues an order to show cause before the investigation or related proceeding is terminated, in whole or in relevant part, as to the party or proposed party which is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Such termination is the result of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A motion to withdraw the complaint, motion, or petition that was the basis for the investigation or related proceeding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A settlement agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A consent order agreement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An arbitration agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Monetary sanctions imposed to compensate the Commission for expenses incurred by a Commission investigative attorney or the Commission's Office of Unfair Import Investigations will include reimbursement for some or all costs reasonably incurred as a direct result of the violation, but will not include attorney's fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Order. When imposing sanctions, the administrative law judge or the

Commission shall describe the conduct determined to constitute a violation of this rule and explain the basis for the sanction imposed. See also Sec.  210.25(d)-(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Inapplicability to discovery. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section do not apply to discovery requests, responses, objections, and motions that are subject to provisions of Sec. Sec.  210.27 through 210.34.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Filing of documents.
