                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Arm's-length contracts. (1) For transportation costs incurred by a lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the transportation allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for transporting the coal under that contract, subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. ONRR's prior approval is not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred under an arm's-length contract. However, before any deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a completed page one of Form ONRR-4293, Coal Transportation Allowance Report, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A transportation allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form ONRR-4293 is filed with ONRR, unless ONRR approves a longer period upon a showing of good cause by the lessee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For transportation costs incurred by a lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the transportation allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for transporting the coal under that contract, subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment.

If the contract reflects more than the total consideration paid, then ONRR may require that the transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If ONRR determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then ONRR shall require that the transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When ONRR determines that the value of the transportation may be unreasonable, ONRR will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's transportation costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-length contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for the purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, the transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual costs. All transportation allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. Prior ONRR approval of transportation allowances is not required for non-arm's-length or no contract situations. However, before any estimated or actual deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a completed Form ONRR-4293 in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A transportation allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form ONRR-4293 is filed with ONRR, unless ONRR approves a longer period upon a showing of good cause by the lessee. ONRR will monitor the allowance deductions to ensure that deductions are reasonable and allowable. When necessary or appropriate, ONRR may direct a lessee to modify its estimated or actual transportation allowance deduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a lessee has a non-arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, the transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual costs.

When necessary or appropriate, ONRR may direct a lessee to modify its estimated or actual transportation allowance deduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no contract situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for transportation during the reporting period, including operating and maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the depreciable investment in

the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) which are an integral part of the transportation system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the lessee can document.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. After a lessee has elected to use either method for a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternative without approval of ONRR.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves which the transportation system services, whichever is appropriate, or a unit of production method. After an election is made, the lessee may not change methods without ONRR approval. A change in ownership of a transportation system shall not alter the depreciation schedule established by the original transporter/lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a transportation system shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> ONRR shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(B)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to transportation facilities first placed in service or acquired after March 1, 1989.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The rate of return shall be the industrial rate associated with Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be the monthly average as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the first month of the reporting period of which the allowance is applicable and shall be effective during the reporting period. The rate shall be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent transportation allowance reporting period (which is determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A lessee may apply to ONRR for exception from the requirement that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. ONRR will grant the exception only if the lessee has a rate for the transportation approved by a Federal agency for Indian leases. ONRR shall deny the exception request if it determines that the rate is excessive as compared to arm's-length transportation charges by systems, owned by the lessee or others, providing similar transportation services in that area. If there are no arm's-length transportation charges, ONRR shall deny the exception request if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No Federal regulatory agency cost analysis exists and the Federal regulatory agency has declined to investigate pursuant to ONRR timely objections upon filing; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The rate significantly exceeds the lessee's actual costs for transportation as determined under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reporting requirements--(1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) With the exception of those transportation allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(v) and (c)(1)(vi) of this section, the lessee shall submit page one of the initial Form ONRR-4293 prior to, or at the same time as, the transportation allowance determined pursuant to an arm's-length contract is reported on

Form ONRR-4430, Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The initial Form ONRR-4293 shall be effective for a reporting period beginning the month that the lessee is first authorized to deduct a transportation allowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar year, or until the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After the initial reporting period and for succeeding reporting periods, lessees must submit page one of Form ONRR-4293 within 3 months after the end of the calendar year, or after the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended, whichever is earlier, unless ONRR approves a longer period (during which period the lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous reporting period). Lessees may request special reporting procedures in unique allowance reporting situations, such as those related to spot sales.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> ONRR may require that a lessee submit arm's-length transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable time, as determined by ONRR.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Transportation allowances that are based on arm's-length contracts and which are in effect at the time these regulations become effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate.

If the transportation is continuing, the lessee shall include on Form ONRR-4293 its estimated costs for the next calendar year. The estimated transportation allowance shall be based on the actual costs for the previous reporting period plus or minus any adjustments that are based on the lessee's knowledge of decreases or increases that will affect the allowance. Form ONRR-4293 must be received by ONRR within 3 months after the end of the previous reporting period, unless ONRR approves a longer period (during which period the lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous reporting period).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For new transportation facilities or arrangements, the lessee's initial Form ONRR-4293 shall include estimates of the allowable transportation costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be based upon the most recently available operations data for the transportation system, or, if such data are not available, the lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar transportation systems.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Non-arm's-length contract or no contract-based transportation allowances that are in effect at the time these regulations become effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. For purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been approved by ONRR in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time these regulations become effective.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Upon request by ONRR, the lessee shall submit all data used to prepare its Form ONRR-4293. The data

shall be provided within a reasonable period of time, as determined by ONRR.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> ONRR may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> If the lessee is authorized to use its Federal-agency-approved rate as its transportation cost in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, it shall follow the reporting requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ONRR may establish reporting dates for individual lessees different than those specified in this paragraph in order to provide more effective administration.

(1) If a lessee deducts a transportation allowance on its Form ONRR-4430 without complying with the requirements of this section, the lessee shall be liable for interest on the amount of such deduction until the requirements of this section are complied with. The lessee also shall repay the amount of any allowance which is disallowed by this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a lessee deducts a transportation allowance on its Form ONRR-4430 without complying with the requirements of this section, the lessee shall be liable for interest on the amount of such deduction until the requirements of this section are complied with.
