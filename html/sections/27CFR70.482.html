                                Sec. 70.482  Offers in compromise of liabilities (other than forfeiture)
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The appropriate TTB officer may compromise any civil  or criminal liability arising under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced  and administered by TTB prior to reference of a case involving such  liability to the Department of Justice for prosecution or defense. (For  compromise of forfeiture liability, see Sec. 70.484 of this part.) Any  such liability may be compromised only upon one or both of the following  two grounds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Doubt as to liability; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Doubt as to collectibility.  No such liability will be compromised if the liability has been  established by a valid judgment or is certain, and there is no doubt as  to the ability of the Government to collect the amounts owing with  respect to such liability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope of compromise agreement. A compromise agreement may relate  to civil or criminal liability for taxes, interest, ad valorem  penalties, or specific penalties. However, a criminal liability may be  compromised only if it involves a violation of a regulatory provision of  26 U.S.C., or a related statute, and then only if such violation was not  deliberately committed with an intent to defraud.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of compromise agreement. A compromise agreement relates  to the entire liability of the taxpayer (including taxes, ad valorem  penalties, and interest) with respect to which the offer in compromise  is submitted and all questions of such liability are conclusively  settled thereby. Specific penalties, however, shall be compromised  separately and not in connection with taxes, interest, or ad valorem  penalties. Neither the taxpayer nor the Government shall, upon  acceptance of an offer in compromise, be permitted to reopen the case  except by reason of falsification or concealment of assets by the  taxpayer, or mutual mistake of a material fact sufficient to cause a  contract to be reformed or set aside. However, acceptance of an offer in  compromise of a civil liability does not remit a criminal liability, nor  does acceptance of an offer in compromise of a criminal liability remit  a civil liability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedure with respect to offers in compromise--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submission  of offers. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Offers in compromise under this section shall be  submitted on TTB Form 5640.1, along with any additional information  required by the officer authorized to accept or reject the offer. If the  offer in compromise is based on inability to pay, the proponent must  submit any financial statement required by such officer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The offer should generally be accompanied by a remittance  representing the amount of the compromise offer or a deposit if the  offer provides for future installment payments. When final action has  been taken, the proponent is notified of the acceptance or rejection of  the offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Stay of collection. The submission of an offer in compromise  shall not automatically operate to stay the collection of any tax  liability. However,   enforcement of collection may be deferred if the interests of the United  States will not be jeopardized thereby.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Acceptance. An offer in compromise shall be considered accepted  only when the proponent thereof is so notified in writing. As a  condition to accepting an offer in compromise, the taxpayer may be  required to enter into any collateral agreement or to post any security  which is deemed necessary for the protection of the interests of the  United States. If the final payment on an accepted offer is contingent  upon the immediate or simultaneous release of a tax lien in whole or in  part, such payment must be in cash, or in the form of a certified,  cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company  incorporated under the laws of the United States or any State,  Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal,  bank, express, or telegraph money order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Withdrawal or rejection. An offer in compromise may be withdrawn  by the proponent at any time prior to its acceptance. In the event an  offer is rejected, the proponent shall be promptly notified in writing.  Frivolous offers or offers submitted for the purpose of delaying the  collection of tax liabilities shall be immediately rejected. If an offer  in compromise is withdrawn or rejected, the amount tendered with the  offer, including all installments paid, shall be refunded without  interest, unless the taxpayer has stated or agreed that the amount  tendered may be applied to the liability with respect to which the offer  was submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Record. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, if an  offer in compromise is accepted, there shall be placed on file the  opinion of counsel for the Bureau with respect to such compromise, with  the reason therefor, and including a statement of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of tax assessed,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of interest, additional amount, addition to the tax,  or assessable penalty, imposed by law on the person against whom the tax  is assessed, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount actually paid in accordance with the terms of the  compromise.  However, no such opinion shall be required with respect to the offer in  compromise of any civil case in which the unpaid amount of tax assessed  (including any interest, additional amount, addition to the tax, or  assessable penalty is less than $50,000. However, such compromise shall  be subject to continuing quality review by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requirement with respect to statute of limitations. No offer in  compromise shall be accepted unless the taxpayer waives the running of  the statutory period of limitations on both or either assessment or  collection of the tax liability involved for the period during which the  offer is pending, or the period during which any installment remains  unpaid, and for one year thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Inspection with respect to accepted offers in compromise. For  provisions relating to the inspection of returns and accepted offers in  compromise, see 26 U.S.C. 6103(k)(l).  (26 U.S.C. 7122)  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  1512-0472)  [T.D. ATF-301, 55 FR 47655, Nov. 14, 1990, as amended by T.D. ATF-331,  57 FR 40329, Sept. 3, 1992; T.D. ATF-450, 66 FR 29029, May 29, 2001]</p>
