All Office of Management and Budget employees will  comply with this section.

When assessing  penalties in accordance with this section, only those violations  occurring within the calendar year (beginning January 1) will be  considered. However, reports of all previous violations remain in the  security files. These are the standard violation penalties that will be  imposed. At the discretion of the Director or his designee, greater or  lesser penalties may be imposed based upon the circumstances giving rise  to the violation, the immediate supervisor's report of inquiry, and the  investigation and findings of the EOP Security Officer and/or the OMB  Associate Director (or Assistant Director) for Administration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> First violation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Written notification of the violation will be filed in the  responsible individual's security file; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The EOP Security Officer and/or the Associate Director (or  Assistant Director) for Administration will consult with the respective  immediate supervisor, and the responsible individual will be advised of  the penalties that may be applied should a second violation occur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Second violation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Written notification of the violation will be filed in the  responsible individual's security file;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The EOP Security Officer and/or the Associate Director (or  Assistant Director) for Administration will consult with the respective  Deputy Associate Director (or the equivalent) and immediate supervisor  and the responsible individual who will be advised of the penalties that  may be applied should a third violation occur; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A letter of Warning will be placed in the Disciplinary Action  file maintained by the Office of Administration, Human Resources  Management Division.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Third violation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Written notification of the violation will be filed in the  responsible individual's security file;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The EOP Security Officer and/or the Associate Director (or  Assistant Director) for Administration will consult with the OMB Deputy  Director, General Counsel, the respective Deputy Associate Director (or  equivalent), and the immediate supervisor and the responsible individual  who will be advised of the penalties that may be applied should a fourth  violation occur; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A Letter of Reprimand will be placed in the Disciplinary  Action file maintained by the OA/HRMD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fourth violation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Written notification of the violation will be filed in the  responsible individual's security file;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The EOP Security Officer and/or the Associate Director (or  Assistant Director) for Administration will consult with the OMB  Director, Deputy Director, General Counsel, the respective Deputy  Associate Director (or the equivalent), and immediate supervisor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The responsible individual may receive a suspension without  pay for a period not to exceed 14 days; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The responsible individual will be advised that future  violations could result in the denial of access to classified material  or other adverse actions as may be appropriate, including dismissal.</p>
