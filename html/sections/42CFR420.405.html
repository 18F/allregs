                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. CMS pays a monetary reward for information that leads to the recovery of at least $100 of Medicare funds from individuals and entities that are engaging in, or have engaged in, acts or omissions that constitute grounds for the imposition of a sanction under section 1128, section 1128A, or section 1128B of the Act or that have otherwise engaged in sanctionable fraud and abuse against the Medicare program. The determination of whether an individual meets the criteria for an award, and the amount of the award, is at the discretion of CMS. CMS pays rewards only if a reward is not otherwise provided for by law. When CMS applies the criteria specified in paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) of this section to determine the eligibility and the amount of the reward, it notifies the beneficiary as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information eligible for reward. (1) In order for an individual to be eligible to receive a reward, the information he or she supplied must relate to the activities of a specific individual or entity and must specify the time period of the alleged activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In order for an individual to be eligible to receive a reward, the information he or she supplied must relate to the activities of a specific individual or entity and must specify the time period of the alleged activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS does not give a reward for information relating to an individual or entity that, at the time the information is provided, is already the subject of a review or investigation by CMS or its contractors, or the OIG, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or any other Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Persons eligible to receive a reward--(1) General rule. Any person (other than one excluded under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) is eligible to receive a reward under this section if the person submits the information in the manner set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Any person (other than one excluded under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) is eligible to receive a reward under this section if the person submits the information in the manner set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Excluded individuals.

After all Medicare funds have been recovered and CMS has determined a participant eligible to receive a reward under the provisions of this section, it notifies the informant of his or her eligibility, by mail, at the most recent address supplied by the individual. It is the individual's responsibility to ensure that the reward program has been notified of any change in his or her address or other relevant personal information (for example, change of name, phone number).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule.
