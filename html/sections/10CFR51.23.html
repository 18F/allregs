                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Commission has generically determined that the environmental impacts of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel beyond the licensed life for operation of a reactor are those impacts identified in NUREG-2157, ``Generic Environmental Impact Statement for Continued Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The environmental reports described in Sec. Sec. 51.50, 51.53, and 51.61 are not required to discuss the environmental impacts of spent nuclear fuel storage in a reactor facility storage pool or an ISFSI for the period following the term of the reactor operating license, reactor combined license, or ISFSI license. The impact determinations in NUREG-2157 regarding continued storage shall be deemed incorporated into the environmental impact statements described in Sec. Sec. 51.75, 51.80(b), 51.95, and 51.97(a). The impact determinations in NUREG-2157 regarding continued storage shall be considered in the environmental assessments described in Sec. Sec. 51.30(b) and 51.95(d), if the impacts of continued storage of spent fuel are relevant to the proposed action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This section does not alter any requirements to consider the environmental impacts of spent fuel storage during the term of a reactor operating license or combined license, or a license for an ISFSI in a licensing proceeding.
