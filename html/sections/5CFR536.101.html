This part supplements and implements the provisions  of 5 U.S.C. 5361-5366 and must be read together with those sections of  law. Under 5 U.S.C. 5362, an employee under a covered pay system who is  placed in a lower grade (e.g., as a result of a reduction in force or  when his or her position is reduced in grade as a result of a  reclassification) is entitled to retain the grade held immediately  before the reduction for a period of 2 years under the circumstances  prescribed in this part. Under 5 U.S.C. 5363, an employee whose rate of  basic pay otherwise would be reduced as a result of a management action  is entitled to retain his or her rate of basic pay under the  circumstances prescribed in this part.</p>
