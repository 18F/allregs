                                Sec. 1.822-10  Amortization of premium and accrual of discount.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and (b) of Sec. 1.818-3,  except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Modifications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.818-3 shall apply to  mutual casualty insurance companies subject to the tax imposed by  section 821 (a) or (c) without regard to the date of acquisition of the  particular securities to which the amortization of premium or accrual of  discount is attributable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> with respect to securities held by a company taxable  under section 821, the basis provided by section 1012 shall be used in  lieu of the acquisition value provided by paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.818- 3. In the case of a company subject to the tax imposed by section  821(c), adjustments to basis to reflect the accrual of discount and the  amortization of premium shall be made in the manner provided by  paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec. 1.818-3. However, for purposes of  determining statutory underwriting income or loss for the taxable year  under section 823, a company subject to the tax imposed by section  821(a) is not required to accrue discount or to amortize premium in  computing its income under section 832 as if it were subject to the tax  imposed by section 831. Thus, the accrual of discount and amortization  of premium required in the computation of taxable investment income by a  company subject to the tax imposed by section 821(a) neither increases  nor decreases the mutual insurance company taxable income of such a  company and, except to the extent such a company actually accrues  discount or amortizes premium for purposes of making the section 832  computation, no adjustment shall be made to the basis of obligations  held by it to   reflect accrual of discount or amortization of premium.
