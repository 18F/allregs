                                Sec. 750.43  Claims payable.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Unless otherwise prescribed, a claim for personal  injury, death, or damage or loss of real or personal property is payable  under this provision when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Caused by an act or omission determined to be negligent,  wrongful, or otherwise involving fault of DON personnel acting within  the scope of their employment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Incident to noncombat activities of the DON. A claim may be  settled under this provision if it arises from authorized activities  essentially military in nature, having little parallel in civilian  pursuits, and in which the U.S. Government has historically assumed a  broad liability, even if not shown to have been caused by any particular  act or omission by DON personnel while acting within the scope of their  employment. Examples include practice firing of missiles and weapons,  sonic booms, training and field exercises, and maneuvers that include  operation of aircraft and vehicles, use and occupancy of real estate,  and movement of combat or other vehicles designed especially for  military use. Activities incident to combat, whether or not in time of  war, and use of DON personnel during civil disturbances are excluded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specific claims payable. Claims payable by the DON under Sec.  750.43(a) (1) and (2) shall include, but not be limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Registered or insured mail. Claims for damage to, loss, or  destruction, even if by criminal acts, of registered or insured mail  while in the possession of DON authorities are payable under the MCA.  This provision is an exception to the general requirement that  compensable damage, loss, or destruction of personal property be caused  by DON personnel while acting within the scope of their employment or  otherwise incident to noncombat activities of the DON. The maximum award  to a claimant under this section is limited to that to which the  claimant would be entitled from the Postal Service under the registry or  insurance fee paid. The award shall not exceed the cost of the item to  the claimant regardless of the fees paid. Claimant may be reimbursed for  the postage and registry or insurance fees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Property bailed to the DON. Claims for damage to or loss of  personal property bailed to the DON, under an express or implied  agreement are payable under the MCA, even though legally enforceable  against the U.S. Government as contract claims, unless by express  agreement the bailor has assumed the risk of damage, loss, or  destruction. Claims filed under this paragraph may, if in the best  interest of the U.S. Government, be referred to and processed by the  Office of the General Counsel, DON, as contract claims.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Real property. Claims for damage to real property incident to  the use and occupancy by the DON, whether under an express or implied  lease or otherwise, are payable under the MCA even though legally  enforceable against the DON as contract claims. Claims filed under this  paragraph may, if in the best interest of the U.S. Government, be  referred to and processed by the Office of the General Counsel, DON, as  contract claims.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Property of U.S. military personnel. Claims of U.S. military  personnel for property lost, damaged, or destroyed under conditions in  Sec. 750.43(a) (1) and (2) occurring on a military installation, not  payable under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act,  are payable under the MCA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Health care and Legal Assistance Providers. Claims arising from  the personal liability of DON health care and legal assistance personnel  for costs, settlements, or judgments for negligent acts or omissions  while acting within the scope of assigned duties or employment are  payable under the MCA. See Sec. 750.54.</p>
