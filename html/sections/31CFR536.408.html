                                Sec. 536.408  Alleged change in ownership or control of an entity designated as a specially designated narcotics trafficker.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A change or alleged change in ownership or control of an entity designated as a specially designated narcotics trafficker shall not be the basis for removal of that entity from the Office of Foreign Assets Control's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List unless, upon investigation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and submission of evidence by the entity, it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control that the transfer to a bona fide purchaser at arm's length is legitimate and that the entity no longer meets the criteria for designation under Sec. 536.312. Evidence submitted must conclusively demonstrate that all ties with other specially designated narcotics traffickers have been completely severed, and may include, but is not limited to, articles of incorporation; identification of new directors, officers, shareholders, and sources of capital; and contracts evidencing the sale of the entity to its new owners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any continuing substantial financial obligations on the part of the new owners to any specially designated narcotics traffickers, including long-term payment plans, leases, or rents, will be considered as evidence of continuing control of the entity by the specially designated narcotics trafficker. Purchase of a designated entity without ongoing substantial financial obligations to a specially designated narcotics trafficker may nonetheless be a basis for subsequent designation of the purchaser, if the transaction is determined materially to assist in or provide financial support for the narcotics trafficking activities of specially designated narcotics traffickers for purposes of Sec. 536.312(b)(2). For example, any acquisition transaction resulting in a direct cash transfer to or other enrichment of a specially designated narcotics trafficker could lead to designation of the purchaser. Mere change in name of an entity will not be considered as constituting a change of the entity's status.
