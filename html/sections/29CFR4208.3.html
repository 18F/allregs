                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Whenever an eligible employer that has partially  withdrawn from a multiemployer plan satisfies the requirements in  Sec. 4208.4 for the reduction or waiver of its partial withdrawal  liability, it may apply to the plan for abatement of its partial  withdrawal liability. Applications shall identify the eligible employer,  the withdrawn employer (if different), the date of withdrawal, and the  basis for reduction or waiver of its withdrawal liability. Upon  receiving a complete application for abatement, the plan sponsor shall  determine, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, whether the  employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its partial  withdrawal liability under Sec. 4208.4. If the plan sponsor determines  that the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its  partial withdrawal liability, the provisions of paragraph (c) of this  section shall apply. If the plan sponsor determines that the employer  does not satisfy the requirements for abatement of its partial  withdrawal liability, the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this  section shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of abatement. Within 60 days after an eligible  employer that partially withdrew from a multiemployer plan applies for  abatement in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the plan  sponsor shall determine whether the employer satisfies the requirements  for abatement of its partial withdrawal liability under Sec. 4208.4 and  shall notify the employer in writing of its determination and of the  consequences of its determination, as described in paragraphs (c) or (d)  and (e) of this section, as appropriate. If a bond or escrow has been  provided to the plan under Sec. 4208.5 of this part, the plan sponsor  shall send a copy of the notice to the bonding or escrow agent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effects of abatement. If the plan sponsor determines that the  employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its partial  withdrawal liability under Sec. 4208.4, then--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer's partial withdrawal liability shall be eliminated  or its annual partial withdrawal liability payments shall be reduced in  accordance with Sec. 4208.6, as applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer's liability for a subsequent withdrawal shall be  determined in accordance with Sec. 4208.7;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any bonds furnished under Sec. 4208.5 shall be canceled and any  amounts held in escrow under Sec. 4208.5 shall be refunded to the  employer; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any withdrawal liability payments originally due and paid after  the end of the plan year in which the conditions for abatement were  satisfied, in excess of the amount due under this part after that date  shall be credited to the remaining withdrawal liability payments, if  any, owed by the employer, beginning with the first payment due after  the revised payment schedule is issued pursuant to this paragraph. If  the credited amount is greater than the outstanding amount of the  employer's partial withdrawal liability, the amount remaining after  satisfaction of the liability shall be refunded to the employer.  Interest on the credited amount at the rate prescribed in part 4219,  subpart C, of this chapter (relating to overdue, defaulted, and overpaid  withdrawal liability) shall be   added if the plan sponsor does not issue a revised payment schedule  reflecting the credit or make the required refund within 60 days after  receipt by the plan sponsor of a complete abatement application.  Interest shall accrue from the 61st day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(2)</em>  shall be treated as a withdrawal liability payment due on the 30th day  after the date of the plan sponsor's notice under paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any bond or escrow furnished under Sec. 4208.5 shall be paid to  the plan within 30 days after the date of the plan sponsor's notice  under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer shall pay to the plan within 30 days after the date  of the plan sponsor's notice under paragraph (b) of this section, the  amount of its withdrawal liability payment or payments, with respect to  which the bond or escrow was furnished, in excess of the bond or escrow.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employer shall resume or continue making its partial  withdrawal liability payments as they are due to the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(2)</em> if the annual payment is reduced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)-(d)(3)</em> of this  section (plus interest determined in accordance with Sec. 4219.31(d) of  this chapter as if the payments were overpayments of withdrawal  liability).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Credit for reduced annual payment. If the employer's annual  partial withdrawal liability payment is reduced, the plan sponsor shall  credit the payments made pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1)-(d)(3) of this  section (plus interest determined in accordance with Sec. 4219.31(d) of  this chapter as if the payments were overpayments of withdrawal  liability) to future withdrawal liability payments owed by the employer,  beginning with the first payment that is due after the determination,  and refund any credit (including interest) remaining after satisfaction  of the outstanding amount of the employer's partial withdrawal  liability.</p>
