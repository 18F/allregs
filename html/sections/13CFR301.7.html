The Application for Investment Assistance (Form ED- 900 or any successor form) may be obtained electronically from http:// www.grants.gov or from the appropriate regional office. In general, EDA  accepts applications on a continuing basis and competitively evaluates  all applications received in quarterly funding cycles throughout the  fiscal year. Subject to the availability of funds, the timing in which  EDA receives complete and competitive applications affects EDA's ability  to participate in a given Project. EDA will evaluate all applications in  accord with the criteria set forth in the applicable FFO and in  Sec. 301.8 and will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Return the application to the applicant for specified  deficiencies and suggest resubmission after corrections are made; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deny the application for specifically stated reasons and notify  the applicant.</p>
