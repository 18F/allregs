                            <p class="depth0">Members and alternate members on the Committee who represent  producers shall be nominated in accordance with the procedures specified  in either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section as the  Committee may determine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mail ballot voting. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Committee shall schedule a meeting,  prior to March 1 of each odd-numbered year, in each producing district  for the purpose of selecting candidates for member and alternate member  nominations. A notice of such meetings will be mailed to each producer  of record in each district. The nomination process is as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any person who produces olives in a particular district may  offer the name of any producer from that district as a candidate for  either a member or alternate member position in said district.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A producer, who produces olives in more than one district, can  be selected as a candidate for a member or alternate member position in  only one district.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Committee will notify by mail producers who are selected  as candidates but are not in attendance at such meetings. Such producers  have the right to decline such listing on the ballot within 7 days of  mailing such notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the event a producer cannot attend a meeting but wishes to  be included on the ballot, that producer may notify the Committee office  in writing no later than 7 days after the date of the nomination meeting  for the producer's district and request that the producer's name be  included on the ballot.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In the event that no candidates or an insufficient number of  candidates are selected at such meetings for the producer members and  alternates in the respective districts, the Committee will give written  notice to producers in said district that additional names may be  submitted for the specified position(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Following such meetings, and no later than March 15 of each odd- numbered year, the Committee shall prepare and mail a ballot to each  producer that delivered olives during that crop year in each district.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A producer who produces olives in more than one district must  choose the district in which the producer will vote and notify the  Committee of that choice. If the Committee is not notified and more than  one ballot is received from such a producer, the first ballot received  will be counted. Candidates may only vote in the district in which they  are seeking nomination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each ballot will list separately the names of candidates for  the member positions and the names of candidates for the alternate  member positions for said district.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A ballot will be mailed to producers of record to give them an  opportunity to vote. Committee records will be used to determine the  list of producers eligible to cast ballots. However, any producer who is  not identified in such records may receive a ballot if the Committee  determines that such producer is eligible to participate in nominations  in that district.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A producer may cast a vote for as many candidates as there are  member or alternate positions in said district.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The candidate on each list, as prescribed in paragraph  (a)(2)(ii) of this section, who receives the most votes will be the  nominee for the first position, and until all positions for that  district are filled, the candidates receiving the second, third and  fourth highest number of votes will be the nominees for the second,  third and fourth position respectively.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> In the event of a tie which would result in elimination of a  tied candidate, a second ballot with the names of those tied candidates  will be mailed to producers in said district for another vote.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nomination meetings. In lieu of the mail ballot nomination  procedure specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Committee may  schedule nomination meetings. In such an event, the following procedure  will apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to March 15 of each odd-numbered year, the Committee shall  schedule a nomination meeting to be held in each district for the  purpose of obtaining nominees for producer members and alternate members  for such district.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nominations for members and balloting thereon shall precede  nominations and balloting for alternate members.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The candidate for each position who receives the highest number  of votes shall be the nominee for the position: Provided, That such  candidate receives a majority of the ballots cast. If no candidate  receives such a majority, the two candidates who received the highest  number of votes shall participate in a run-off balloting to determine  which is the nominee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purposes of this section, a producer is a person engaged  in a proprietary capacity as a single business unit in the production of  olives for market as packaged olives and includes an individual (owner- operated), partnership, corporation, association, institution, or other  legal business unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determination of producer eligibility. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Only producers  (including duly authorized officers or employees of producers) who  produced olives within the district shall participate in the nomination  and election of producer members and alternates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each producer (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section)  shall be entitled to cast only one vote for each position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A producer having olive acreage in more than one district may  participate in nominations and elections in only one district. The  district in which the producer wishes to participate shall be the  producer's choice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any member of a producer's family (husband, wife, son or  daughter) may vote on behalf of an owner-operated, landlord-tenant,  family enterprise, or other farming unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any authorized officer or employee of a corporation which is a  producer may vote.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any authorized member of a partnership which is a producer may  vote.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Power of attorney (proxies) for voting purposes are not  accepted.
