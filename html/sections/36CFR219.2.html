                            <p class="depth0">Forest Service planning occurs at different organizational levels  and geographic scales. Planning occurs at three levels--national  strategic planning, NFS unit planning, and project or activity planning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> National strategic planning. The Chief of the Forest Service is  responsible for national planning, such as preparation of the Forest  Service strategic plan required under the Government Performance and  Results Modernization Act of 2010 (5 U.S.C. 306; 31 U.S.C. 1115-1125; 31  U.S.C. 9703-9704), which is integrated with the requirements of the  Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as  amended by the NFMA. The strategic plan establishes goals, objectives,  performance measures, and strategies for management of the NFS, as well  as the other Forest Service mission areas: Research and Development,  State and Private Forestry, and International Programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> National Forest System unit planning. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NFS unit planning  results in the development, amendment, or revision of a land management  plan. A land management plan provides a framework for integrated  resource management and for guiding project and activity decisionmaking  on a national forest, grassland, prairie, or other administrative unit.  A plan reflects the unit's expected distinctive roles and contributions  to the local area, region, and Nation, and the roles for which the plan  area is best suited, considering the Agency's mission, the unit's unique  capabilities, and the resources and management of other lands in the  vicinity. Through the adaptive planning cycle set forth in this subpart,  a plan can be changed to reflect new information and changing  conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A plan does not authorize projects or activities or commit the  Forest Service to take action. A plan may constrain the Agency from  authorizing or carrying out projects and activities, or the manner in  which they may occur. Projects and activities must be consistent with  the plan (Sec. 219.15). A plan does not regulate uses by the public,  but a project or activity decision that regulates a use by the public  under 36 CFR Part 261, Subpart B, may be made contemporaneously with the  approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision. Plans should not  repeat laws, regulations, or program management policies, practices, and  procedures that are in the Forest Service Directive System.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The supervisor of the national forest, grassland, prairie, or  other comparable administrative unit is the responsible official for  development and approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision for  lands under the responsibility of the supervisor, unless a regional  forester; the Chief; the Under Secretary, Natural Resources and  Environment; or the Secretary acts as the responsible official. Two or  more responsible officials may undertake joint planning over lands under  their respective jurisdictions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A plan for a unit that contains an experimental area may not be  approved without the concurrence of the appropriate research station  director with respect to the direction applicable to that area, and a  plan amendment applicable to an experimental area may not be approved  without the concurrence of the appropriate research station director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Chief is responsible for leadership and direction for  carrying out the NFS land management planning program under this part.  The Chief shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Establish planning procedures for this part in the Forest  Service Directive System in Forest Service Manual 1920--Land Management  Planning and in Forest Service Handbook 1909.12--Land Management  Planning Handbook.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Establish and administer a national oversight process for  accountability and consistency of NFS land management planning under  this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Establish procedures in the Forest Service Directive System  for obtaining inventory data on the various renewable resources, and  soil and water.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Project and activity planning. The supervisor or district ranger  is the responsible official for project and activity decisions, unless a  higher-level official acts as the responsible official. Requirements for  project or activity planning are established in the Forest Service  Directive System. Except as provided in the plan consistency  requirements in Sec. 219.15, none of the requirements of this part  apply to projects or activities.</p>
