                                Sec. 226.73  Changes in reduction amount.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The reduction amount is not changed when a tier I benefit increases  because of a recomputation or a general adjustment in annuity rates,  such as a cost-of-living increase. However, the reduction amount may  change for the following reasons:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A spouse or divorced spouse becomes entitled to a tier I benefit  after the effective date of the reduction. The reduction amount is  recomputed as if the spouse or divorced spouse were entitled to a tier I  benefit on the date the reduction first applied. The new reduction  amount applies beginning with the date the spouse or divorced spouse  tier I benefit begins.</p><p class="depth2">Example: An employee became entitled to an annuity with a tier I  component of $500 on May 1, 1991. He was also receiving a state  disability benefit of $300 a month based on employment not covered under  the Social Security Act. On June 1, 1991, the employee's tier I  increased to $520.70. On October 1, 1991, the employee's wife becomes  entitled to an annuity with a tier I benefit of $260.00. The tier I  amount ($250) that would have been payable to the wife on May 1, 1991  (assuming she had been eligible for a benefit at that time) is used to  determine the reduction for other disability benefits beginning October  1, 1991.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The tier I benefit of a spouse or divorced spouse annuity ends  after the effective date of the reduction. The new reduction amount is  computed using the tier I rate to which the employee was entitled when  the reduction first applied. The new reduction amount applies beginning  with the month after the month in which the spouse or divorced spouse  tier I benefit ends.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The average current earnings are redetermined, as shown in Sec.  226.74.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The amount of the other disability benefit changes. The  reduction amount is recomputed to use the new benefit rate beginning  with the date on which the new rate is payable. Any increases in the  tier I amounts which were effective after the reduction first applied  are not included in computing the new reduction amount.</p><p class="depth2">Example: The employee's tier I benefit is $500 on May 1, 1991, when  the annuity is first reduced for other disability benefits. The tier I  increases to $520 effective June 1, 1991. When the amount of the  disability benefit changes on October 1, 1991, $500, not $520, is used  as the employee tier I amount in recomputing the reduction amount.</p>
