                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Symmetrical step, bow, and stern landing. For symmetrical step, bow, and stern landings, the limit water reaction load factors are those computed under Sec. 25.527. In addition--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For symmetrical step landings, the resultant water load must be applied at the keel, through the center of gravity, and must be directed perpendicularly to the keel line;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For symmetrical bow landings, the resultant water load must be applied at the keel, one-fifth of the longitudinal distance from the bow to the step, and must be directed perpendicularly to the keel line; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For symmetrical stern landings, the resultant water load must be applied at the keel, at a point 85 percent of the longitudinal distance from the step to the stern post, and must be directed perpendicularly to the keel line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unsymmetrical landing for hull and single float seaplanes. Unsymmetrical step, bow, and stern landing conditions must be investigated. In addition--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The loading for each condition consists of an upward component and a side component equal, respectively, to 0.75 and 0.25 tan [beta] times the resultant load in the corresponding symmetrical landing condition; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The point of application and direction of the upward component of the load is the same as that in the symmetrical condition, and the point of application of the side component is at the same longitudinal station as the upward component but is directed inward perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry at a point midway between the keel and chine lines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unsymmetrical landing; twin float seaplanes. The unsymmetrical loading consists of an upward load at the step of each float of 0.75 and a side load of 0.25 tan [beta] at one float times the step landing load reached under Sec. 25.527. The side load is directed inboard, perpendicularly to the plane of symmetry midway between the keel and chine lines of the float, at the same longitudinal station as the upward load.</p>
