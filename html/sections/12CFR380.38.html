In order to seek a judicial determination of a claim that has been disallowed, in whole or in part, by the Corporation as receiver, the claimant, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(4)(A), may either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> File suit on such claim in the district or territorial court of the United States for the district within which the principal place of business of the covered financial company is located; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continue an action commenced before the date of appointment of the

receiver, in the court in which the action was pending.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Timing. Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(4)(B), a claimant who seeks a judicial determination of a claim disallowed by the Corporation as receiver must file suit on such claim before the end of the 60-day period beginning on the earlier of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date of any notice of disallowance of such claim;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The end of the 180-day claims determination period; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the claims determination period was extended with respect to such claim under Sec. 380.36(b), the end of such extended claims determination period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statute of limitations.
