                            <p class="depth0">This subpart specifies how to perform emission testing and emission modeling required elsewhere in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use the equipment and procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1066 to determine whether vehicles meet the evaporative and refueling emission standards specified in Sec.  1037.103.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where exhaust emission testing is required, use the equipment and procedures in 40 CFR part 1066 to determine whether your vehicles meet the duty-cycle emission standards in subpart B of this part. Measure the emissions of all the exhaust constituents subject to emission standards as specified in 40 CFR part 1066. Use the applicable duty cycles specified in Sec.  1037.510.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use the applicable fuels specified 40 CFR part 1065 to perform valid tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For service accumulation, use the test fuel or any commercially available fuel that is representative of the fuel that in-use vehicles will use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For diesel-fueled vehicles, use the appropriate diesel fuel specified for emission testing. Unless we specify otherwise, the appropriate diesel test fuel is ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For gasoline-fueled vehicles, use the gasoline specified for ``General Testing''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You may use special or alternate procedures as specified in 40 CFR 1065.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> This subpart is addressed to you as a manufacturer, but it applies equally to anyone who does testing for you, and to us when we perform testing to determine if your vehicles meet emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Apply this paragraph (g) whenever we specify use of standard trailers. Unless otherwise specified, a tolerance of 2 inches applies for all nominal trailer dimensions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The standard trailer for high-roof tractors must meet the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is an unloaded two-axle dry van box trailer 53.0 feet long, 102 inches wide, and 162 inches high (measured from the ground with the trailer level).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It has a king pin located with its center 360.5 inches from the front of the trailer and a minimized trailer gap (no greater than 45 inches).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> It has a smooth surface with nominally flush rivets and does not include any aerodynamic features such as side fairings, boat tails, or gap reducers. It may have a scuff band of no more than 0.13 inches in thickness.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> It includes dual 22.5 inch wheels, standard mudflaps, and standard landing gear. The centerline of the rear tandem axle must be 146 4 inches from the rear of the trailer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The standard trailer for mid-roof tractors is an empty two-axle tanker trailer 421 feet long by 140 inches high.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It has a 401 feet long cylindrical tank with a 70007 gallon capacity, smooth surface, and rounded ends.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The standard tanker trailer does not include any aerodynamic features such as side fairings, but does include a centered 20 inch manhole, side-centered ladder, and lengthwise walkway. It includes dual 24.5 inch wheels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The standard trailer for low-roof tractors is an unloaded two-axle flat bed trailer 531 feet long and 102 inches wide.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The deck height is 60.00.5 inches in the front and 55.00.5 inches in the rear. The standard trailer does not include any aerodynamic features such as side fairings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It includes an air suspension and dual 22.5 inch wheels on tandem axles spread up to 122 inches apart between axle centerlines, measured along the length of the trailer.
