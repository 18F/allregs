                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">Ancillary steering equipment means steering equipment, other than  the required control systems and power actuating systems, that either is  not required, such as automatic pilot or non-followup control from the  pilothouse, or is necessary to perform a specific required function,  such as the automatic detection and isolation of a defective section of  a tanker's hydraulic steering gear.</p><p class="depth0">Auxiliary steering gear means the equipment, other than any part of  the main steering gear, necessary to steer the vessel in case of failure  of the main steering gear, not including a tiller, quadrant, or other  component serving the same purpose. Control system means the equipment  by which orders for rudder movement are transmitted from the pilothouse  to the steering-gear power units. A control system for steering gear  includes, but is not limited to, one or more--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transmitters;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Receivers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Feedback devices;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Hydraulic servo-control pumps, with associated motors and motor  controllers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Differential units, hunting gear, and similar devices;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> All gearing, piping, shafting, cables, circuitry, and ancillary  devices for controlling the output of power units; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Means of bringing steering-gear power units into operation.</p><p class="depth0">Fast-acting valve, as used in this subpart, means a ball, plug,  spool, or similar valve with a handle connected for quick manual  operation.</p><p class="depth0">Followup control means closed-loop (feedback) control that relates  the position of the helm to a specific rudder angle by transmitting the  helm-angle order to the power actuating system and, by means of  feedback, automatically stopping the rudder when the angle selected by  the helm is reached.</p><p class="depth0">Main steering gear means the machinery, including power actuating  systems, and the means of applying torque to the rudder stock, such as a  tiller or quadrant, necessary for moving the rudder to steer the vessel  in normal service.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum ahead service speed means the greatest speed that a vessel  is designed to maintain in service at sea at the deepest loadline draft.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum astern speed means the speed that it is estimated the vessel  can attain at the maximum designed power astern at the deepest loadline  draft.</p><p class="depth0">Power actuating system means the hydraulic equipment for applying  torque to the rudder stock. It includes, but is not limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rudder actuators;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Steering-gear power units; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pipes, valves, fittings, linkages, and cables for transmitting  power from the power unit or units to the rudder actuator or actuators.</p><p class="depth0">Speedily regained, as used in this subpart, refers to the time it  takes one qualified crewmember, after arriving in the steering-gear  compartment, and without the use of tools, to respond to a failure of  the steering gear and take the necessary corrective action.</p><p class="depth0">Steering capability means steering equivalent to that required of  auxiliary steering gear by Sec. 58.25-10(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Steering gear means the machinery, including power actuating  systems, control systems, and ancillary equipment, necessary for moving  the rudder to steer the vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Steering-gear power unit means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of electric steering gear, an electric motor and its  associated electrical equipment, including motor controller, disconnect  switch, and feeder circuit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an electro-hydraulic steering gear, an electric  motor, connected pump, and associated electrical equipment such as the  motor controller, disconnect switch, and feeder circuit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of hydraulic steering gear, the pump and its prime  mover.</p><p class="depth0">Tank vessel, as used in this subpart, means a self-propelled vessel,  including a chemical tanker or a gas carrier, defined either as a tanker  by 46 U.S.C. 2101(38) or as a tank vessel by 46 U.S.C. 2101(39).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Unless it otherwise complies with this subpart, each self- propelled vessel must be provided with a main steering gear and an  auxiliary steering gear. These gear must be arranged so that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The failure of one will not render the other inoperative; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transfer from the main to the auxiliary can be effected quickly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Each substantial replacement of steering-gear components or  reconfiguration of steering-gear arrangements on an existing vessel must  comply with the requirements of this subpart for new installations to  the satisfaction of the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Each non-pressure-containing steering-gear component and each  rudder stock must be of sound and reliable construction, meet the  minimum material requirements of Sec. 58.25-75, and be designed to  standards at least equal to those established by the ABS Steel Vessel  Rules (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 58.03-1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The suitability of any essential steering-gear component not  duplicated must be specifically approved by the Commanding Officer,  Marine Safety Center. Where a steering-gear component is shared by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A control system (e.g., a control-system transfer switch located  in the steering-gear compartment);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The main and auxiliary steering gear (e.g., an isolation valve);  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A power actuating system and its control system (e.g., a  directional control valve)--the requirements for both systems apply, to  provide the safest and most reliable arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Steering gear must be separate and independent of all other  shipboard systems, except--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Electrical switchboards from which they are powered;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Automatic pilots and similar navigational equipment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Propulsion machinery for an integrated system of propulsion and  steering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Except on a vessel with an integrated system of propulsion and  steering, no thruster may count as part of a vessel's required steering  capability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Except for a tank vessel subject to Sec. 58.25-85(e), each  oceangoing vessel required to have power-operated steering gear must be  provided with arrangements for steadying the rudder both in an emergency  and during a shift from one steering gear to another. On hydraulic  steering gear, a suitable arrangement of stop valves in the main piping  is an acceptable means of steadying the rudder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General arrangement plans for the main and auxiliary steering  gear and their piping must be submitted for approval in accordance with  subpart 50.20 of this subchapter.
