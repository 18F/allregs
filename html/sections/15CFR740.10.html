                            <p class="depth0">License Exception RPL authorizes exports and reexports associated with one-for-one replacement of parts, components, accessories, and attachments. License Exception RPL also authorizes exports and reexports of certain items currently ``subject to the EAR'' to or for, or to replace, a defense article described in an export or reexport authorization issued under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act. It does not, however, authorize the export or reexport of defense articles subject to the ITAR, i.e., described on the United States Munitions List (22 CFR 121.1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Parts, components, accessories, and attachments--(1) Scope. The provisions of this paragraph (a) authorize the export and reexport of one-for-one replacement parts, components, accessories, and attachments for previously exported equipment or other end items.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Scope. The provisions of this paragraph (a) authorize the export and reexport of one-for-one replacement parts, components, accessories, and attachments for previously exported equipment or other end items.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One-for-one replacement of parts, components, accessories, or attachments. (i) The terms replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments as used in this section mean parts, components, accessories, or attachments needed for the immediate repair of equipment or other end items, including replacement of defective or worn parts or components. (These terms include `subassemblies,' but do not include test instruments or operating supplies. The term `subassembly' means a number of parts or components assembled to perform a specific function or functions within a commodity. One example would be printed circuit boards with components mounted thereon. This definition does not include major subsystems such as those composed of a number of `subassemblies.') Items that improve or change the basic design characteristics, e.g., as to accuracy, capability, performance or productivity, of the equipment or other end item upon which they are installed, are not deemed to be replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments. For kits consisting of replacement parts or components, consult Sec. 740.9(a)(4) of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The terms replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments as used in this section mean parts, components, accessories, or attachments needed for the immediate repair of equipment or other end items, including replacement of defective or worn parts or components.

The conditions of the original U.S. authorization must not have been violated. Accordingly, the export of replacement parts, components, accessories, and attachments may be made only by the party who originally exported or reexported the commodity to be repaired, or by a party that has confirmed the existence of appropriate authority for the original transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The parts, components, accessories, or attachments to be replaced must either be destroyed abroad or returned promptly to the person who supplied the replacements, or to a foreign firm that is under the effective control of that person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exclusions to License Exception RPL.

Replacements may be exported to replace spares that were authorized to accompany the export of equipment or other end items as those spares are used in the repair of the equipment or other end item. This allows maintenance of the stock of spares at a consistent level as the parts, components, accessories, or attachments are used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to any destination, except the countries listed in Supplement No. 3 to part 744 of the EAR (Countries Not Subject to Certain Nuclear End Use Restrictions in Sec. 744.2(a)), if the item is to be incorporated into or used in nuclear weapons, nuclear explosive devices, nuclear testing related to activities described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR, the chemical processing of irradiated special nuclear or source material, the production of heavy water, the separation of isotopes of source and special nuclear materials, or the fabrication of nuclear reactor fuel containing plutonium, as described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> No replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to countries in Country Group E:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to this part) (countries designated by the Secretary of State as supporting acts of international terrorism) if the commodity to be repaired is an ``aircraft'' (as defined in Sec. 772.1 of the EAR) or is controlled for national security (NS) reasons.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> No replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to countries in Country Group E:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to this part) if the commodity to be repaired is explosives detection equipment classified under ECCN 2A983 or related software classified under ECCN 2D983.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> No replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to countries in Country Group E:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to this part) if the commodity to be repaired is concealed object detection equipment classified under ECCN 2A984 or related software classified under ECCN 2D984.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The conditions described in this paragraph (a)(3) relating to replacement of parts, components, accessories, or attachments do not apply to reexports to a foreign country of parts, components accessories, or attachments as replacements in foreign-origin products, if at the time the replacements are furnished, the foreign-origin product is eligible for export to such country under any of the license exceptions in this part or the exceptions in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR (De minimis U.S. content).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> ``Parts,'' ``components,'' ``accessories,'' and ``attachments'' classified in 9x515 or ``600 series'' ECCNs may not be exported or reexported to a destination listed in Country Group D:5 (see Supplement No. 1 to this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reexports.

Commodities and software legally exported or reexported to a consignee in Country Group D:1 (except the People's Republic of China (PRC)) (see Supplement No. 1 to this part) that are sent to the United States or a foreign party for servicing may be returned to the country from which it was sent, provided that both of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The exporter making the shipment is the same person or firm to whom the original license was issued; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The end use and the end user of the serviced commodities or software and other particulars of the transaction, as set forth in the application and supporting documentation that formed the basis for issuance of the license have not changed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Terrorist supporting countries.
