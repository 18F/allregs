                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contribution allocation. Each participant may indicate his or  her choice of TSP Funds for the allocation of future deposits by using  the TSP Web site or the ThriftLine, or by completing and filing the  appropriate paper TSP form with the TSP record keeper in accordance with  the form's instructions. The following rules apply to contribution  allocations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contribution allocations must be made in one percent increments.  The sum of the percentages elected for all of the TSP Funds must equal  100 percent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The percentage elected by a participant for investment of future  deposits in a TSP Fund will be applied to all sources of contributions  and transfers (or rollovers) from traditional IRAs and eligible employer  plans. A participant may not make different percentage elections for  different sources of contributions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A participant who elects for the first time to invest in a TSP  Fund other than the G Fund must execute an acknowledgment of risk in  accordance with Sec. 1601.33;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All deposits made on behalf of a participant who does not have a  contribution allocation in effect will be invested in the G Fund; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Once a contribution allocation becomes effective, it remains in  effect until it is superseded by a subsequent contribution allocation or  the participant withdraws his or her entire account. If a separated  participant is rehired and had not withdrawn his or her entire TSP  account, the participant's last contribution allocation before  separation from Government service will be effective until a new  allocation is made. If, however, the participant had withdrawn his or  her entire TSP account, then the participant's contributions will be  allocated to the G Fund until a new allocation is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect of rejection of contribution allocation. If a participant  does not correctly complete a contribution allocation, the attempted  allocation will have no effect. The TSP will provide the participant  with a written statement of the reason the transaction was rejected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contribution elections. A participant may designate the amount  or type of employee contributions he or she wishes to make to the TSP or  may stop contributions only in accordance with 5 CFR part 1600.
