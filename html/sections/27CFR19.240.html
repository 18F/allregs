                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. --(1) Criteria requiring ETF payment. Under certain conditions, a proprietor may not make payments by cash, check, or money order. Instead, the proprietor must use the services of a commercial bank to pay tax on distilled spirits tax by EFT. Payments must be made by EFT in the current calendar year if the proprietor, as a taxpayer, was liable for $5 million or more in taxes on distilled spirits during the prior calendar year. For the purpose of determining whether the proprietor is subject to this requirement, the proprietor must use the total amount of tax liability on distilled spirits incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter (gross tax liability). Gross tax liability includes the distilled spirits tax on all taxable withdrawals of spirits and taxable importations of spirits, as well as tax on spirits brought into the United States from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands during the calendar year. This figure includes taxes incurred at any and all premises at which the proprietor conducts regulated activities. The proprietor may not net out or adjust for any drawback, credits or refunds of tax that are allowed. Overpayments made in excess of actual tax liability will not be included in the gross tax liability figure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Controlled group. If the taxpayer is a member of a controlled group, the controlled group is treated as a single taxpayer when calculating liability of $5 million or more in distilled spirits taxes during the prior calendar year. A controlled group is a related group of taxpayers and is defined in subpart D of part 70 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Separate return and payment for each DSP. When the proprietor makes payments by EFT, the proprietor must file a separate return on form TTB F 5000.24 and make a separate EFT payment for each DSP from which spirits are withdrawn upon determination of tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Requirements--(1) Notice to TTB. If the proprietor's gross distilled spirits tax liability is $5 million or more in one calendar year, the proprietor must notify the appropriate TTB officer of this fact not later than January 10 of the following year. The proprietor must use the total amount of tax liability incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter to determine whether it must make this notification. Exception: this notice requirement does not apply if the proprietor already pays tax on distilled spirits by EFT. The notice shall be an agreement to make payments by EFT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Separate EFT for each return. For each return filed in accordance with this part, the proprietor will direct the bank to make an EFT to the Treasury Account for the amount of the tax reported due on the return. The proprietor must give instructions to the bank early enough for the EFT to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than close of business on the last day for filing the return as prescribed in Secs. 19.236 or 19.237, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Discontinuing EFT payments. If the proprietor pays tax by EFT and has a gross tax liability of less than $5 million in distilled spirits taxes during a calendar year, combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, payment by EFT will be optional in the following year. The proprietor may continue to remit tax payment by EFT as provided in this section, or the proprietor may remit taxpayment using any acceptable method as set forth in Sec. 19.239. If the proprietor decides to stop paying tax by EFT, the proprietor must give the appropriate TTB officer written notice of that decision. The proprietor must attach a written notice to the first return on form TTB F 5000.24 filed using a method of payment other than EFT. Such notice must state that tax is not due by EFT because the proprietor's tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less than $5 million. The proprietor must further state that future tax payments will be filed with the returns on TTB F 5000.24.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Remittance--(1) Identifying EFT payments. When the proprietor completes the return on TTB F 5000.24, the proprietor must indicate on the form that the tax was paid by EFT. The proprietor must file the completed TTB F

5000.24 with TTB as directed by the instructions on the form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Credit for payment. TTB will credit the proprietor as having made a tax payment when the Treasury Account receives the EFT. TTB considers the EFT to be received by the Treasury Account when the EFT is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Record of payment. When a proprietor directs a bank to make an EFT as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any transfer data record furnished to the proprietor as part of normal banking procedures will serve as the record of payment. The proprietor will retain this document as part of the required records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Failure to make a tax payment by EFT. The proprietor will be subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, or 6656 for failure to make a required EFT tax payment before close of business on the last day for filing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Procedure. Upon receipt of a notice filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will provide the proprietor with a copy of the TTB Procedure entitled ``Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer''. This publication outlines the procedure that the proprietor must follow when preparing returns and payments by EFT as required by this part. The proprietor must follow instructions provided by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for submitting the EFT payments that must be made to CBP.
