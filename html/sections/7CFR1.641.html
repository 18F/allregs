                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. By agreement of the parties or with the permission of  the ALJ, a party may obtain discovery of information to assist the party  in preparing or presenting its case. Available methods of discovery are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written interrogatories;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Depositions as provided in paragraph (h) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requests for production of designated documents or tangible  things or for entry on designated land for inspection or other purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria. Discovery may occur only as agreed to by the parties  or as authorized by the ALJ in a written order or during a prehearing  conference. The ALJ may authorize discovery only if the party requesting  discovery demonstrates:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the discovery will not unreasonably delay the hearing  process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the information sought:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Will be admissible at the hearing or appears reasonably  calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is not already in the license proceeding record or otherwise  obtainable by the party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is not cumulative or repetitious; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Is not privileged or protected from disclosure by applicable  law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the scope of the discovery is not unduly burdensome;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That the method to be used is the least burdensome method  available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> That any trade secrets or proprietary information can be  adequately safeguarded; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> That the standards for discovery under paragraphs (f) through  (h) of this section have been met, if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Motions. A party may initiate discovery:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pursuant to an agreement of the parties; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By filing a motion that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Briefly describes the proposed method(s), purpose, and scope of  the discovery;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Explains how the discovery meets the criteria in paragraphs  (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Attaches a copy of any proposed discovery request (written  interrogatories, notice of deposition, or request for production of  designated documents or tangible things or for entry on designated  land).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Timing of motions. A party must file any discovery motion under  paragraph (c)(2) of this section within 7 days after issuance of the  referral notice under Sec. 1.625(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Objections. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A party must file any objections to a discovery  motion or to specific portions of a proposed discovery request within 7  days after service of the motion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An objection must explain how, in the objecting party's view,  the discovery sought does not meet the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1)  through (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Materials prepared for hearing. A party generally may not obtain  discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise discoverable under  paragraph (b) of this section if they were prepared in anticipation of  or for the hearing by or for another party's representative (including  the party's attorney, expert, or consultant).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a party wants to discover such materials, it must show:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That it has substantial need of the materials in preparing its  own case; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the  substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In ordering discovery of such materials when the required  showing has been made, the ALJ must protect against disclosure of the  mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an  attorney.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Experts. Unless restricted by the ALJ, a party may discover any  facts known or opinions held by an expert concerning any relevant  matters that are not privileged. Such discovery will be permitted only  if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The expert is expected to be a witness at the hearing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The expert is relied on by another expert who is expected to be  a witness at the hearing, and the party shows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That it has a compelling need for the information; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That it cannot practicably obtain the information by other  means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Limitations on depositions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A party may depose a witness  only if the party shows that the witness:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Will be unable to attend the hearing because of age, illness, or  other incapacity; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is unwilling to attend the hearing voluntarily, and the party  is unable to compel the witness's attendance at the hearing by subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section does not apply to any  person employed by or under contract with the party seeking the  deposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A party may depose a senior Department employee only if the  party shows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the employee's testimony is necessary in order to provide  significant, unprivileged information that is not available from any  other source or by less burdensome means; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the deposition would not significantly interfere with the  employee's ability to perform his or her government duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Completion of discovery. All discovery must be completed within  25 days after the initial prehearing conference, unless the ALJ sets a  different deadline.</p>
