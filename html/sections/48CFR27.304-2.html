                            <p class="depth0">The following procedures apply unless an interagency agreement  provides otherwise:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a Government agency requests another Government agency to  award a contract on its behalf, the request should explain any special  circumstances surrounding the contract and specify the patent rights  clause to be used. The clause should be selected and modified, if  necessary, in accordance with the policies and procedures of this  subpart. If, however, the request states that a clause of the requesting  agency is required (e.g., because of statutory requirements, a  deviation, or exceptional circumstances), the awarding agency shall use  that clause rather than those of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the request states that an agency clause is required and the  work to be performed under the contract is not severable and is funded  wholly or in part by the requesting agency, then include the requesting  agency clause and no other patent rights clause in the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the request states that an agency clause is required, and the  work to be performed under the contract is severable, then the  contracting officer shall assure that the requesting agency clause  applies only to that severable portion of the work and that the work for  the awarding agency is subject to the appropriate patent rights clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the request states that a requesting agency clause is not  required in any resulting contract, the awarding agency shall use the  appropriate patent rights clause, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any action requiring an agency determination, report, or  deviation involved in the use of the requesting agency's clause is the  responsibility of the requesting agency unless the agencies agree  otherwise. However, the awarding agency may not alter the requesting  agency's clause without prior approval of the requesting agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The requesting agency may require, and provide instructions  regarding, the forwarding or handling of any invention disclosures or  other reporting requirements of the specified clauses. Normally, the  requesting agency is responsible for the administration of any subject  inventions. This responsibility shall be established in advance of  awarding any contracts.</p>
