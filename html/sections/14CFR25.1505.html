                            <p class="depth0">The maximum operating limit speed (VMO/MMO airspeed or Mach Number,  whichever is critical at a particular altitude) is a speed that may not  be deliberately exceeded in any regime of flight (climb, cruise, or  descent), unless a higher speed is authorized for flight test or pilot  training operations. VMO/MMO must be established so that it is not  greater than the design cruising speed VC and so that it is sufficiently  below VD/MD or VDF/MDF, to make it highly improbable that the latter  speeds will be inadvertently exceeded in operations. The speed margin  between VMO/MMO and VD/MD or VDFM/DF may not be less than that  determined under Sec. 25.335(b) or found necessary during the flight  tests conducted under Sec. 25.253.
