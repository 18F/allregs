                            <p class="depth0">An episode with four or fewer visits is paid the national per-visit amount by discipline updated annually by the applicable market basket for each visit type. The national per-visit amount is determined by using cost data set forth in Sec. 484.210(a) and adjusting by the appropriate wage index based on the site of service for the beneficiary. For 2008 and subsequent calendar years, an amount will be added to low-utilization payment adjustments for low-utilization episodes that occur as the beneficiary's only episode or initial episode in a sequence of adjacent episodes. For purposes of the home health PPS, a sequence of adjacent episodes for a beneficiary is a series of claims with no more than 60 days without home care between the end of one episode, which is the 60th day (except for episodes that have been PEP-adjusted), and the beginning of the next episode. This additional amount will be updated annually after 2008 by a factor equal to the applicable home health market basket percentage.
