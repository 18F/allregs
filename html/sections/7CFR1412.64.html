Any form containing the signature of a person or legal entity that contains a preprinted certification statement on the form will be construed to be a representation and certification of and from the person or legal entity signing the form regardless of whether or not the person or legal entity personally made the entry or entries on the form. Errors in reporting may impact eligibility or extent of eligibility. Payments under this part will be based on the most correct information available. CCC's issuing payments based on the face of a contract or application does not signify CCC's approval of the representations made by participants.
