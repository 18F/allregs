Because DOT and its components make many of these records available on their Web pages (http://www.dot.gov or http://www.dot.gov/foia), requesters may find it preferable to obtain such records directly from the Web pages instead of submitting a FOIA request, if the Web pages contain records that meet their needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subpart D of this part contains the DOT regulations concerning time limits applicable to processing requests for records under subpart C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Subpart E of this part contains the DOT regulations concerning processing fees applicable to records made available under subpart B or requested under subpart C.</p>
