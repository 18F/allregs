                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this subpart is to implement section 721 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for 1999, Public Law 105-261. This  section amended chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, and chapter  89 of title 5, United States Code, to establish a demonstration project  under which certain Medicare and other eligible Department of Defense  (DoD) beneficiaries can enroll in health benefit plans offered under the  Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program in certain geographic  areas. The legislation was signed into law on October 17, 1998. The  demonstration project will run for a period of three years. The  legislation requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and DoD to  jointly produce and submit two reports to Congress designed to assess  the viability of expanding access to the FEHB Program to certain  Medicare and other eligible DoD beneficiaries permanently. OPM is  authorizing certain differences from regular FEHB Program practices in  order to ensure the successful implementation of the demonstration  project. This regulation authorizes those differences.</p>
