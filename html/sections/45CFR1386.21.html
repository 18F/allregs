                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In order for a State to receive Federal funding for Protection  and Advocacy activities under this subpart, as well as for the State  Council on Developmental Disabilities activities (subpart D of this  part), the Protection and Advocacy System must meet the requirements of  section 143 and 144 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 15043 and 15044) and that  system must be operational.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allotments must be used to supplement and not to supplant the  level of non-Federal funds available in the State for activities under  the Act, which shall include activities on behalf of individuals with  developmental disabilities to remedy abuse, neglect, and violations of  rights as well as information and referral activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>. Clients must be informed at the time they apply for services  of such criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A Protection and Advocacy System shall be free from hiring  freezes, reductions in force, prohibitions on staff travel, or other  policies, imposed by the State, to the extent that such policies would  impact system program staff or functions funded with Federal funds, and  would prevent the system from carrying out its mandates under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A Protection and Advocacy System shall have sufficient staff,  qualified by training and experience, to carry out the responsibilities  of the system in accordance with the priorities of the system and  requirements of the Act. These responsibilities include the  investigation of allegations of abuse, neglect and representations of  individuals with developmental disabilities regarding rights violations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A Protection and Advocacy System may exercise its authority  under State law where the State authority exceeds the authority required  by the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of  2000. However, State law must not diminish the required authority of the  Protection and Advocacy System as set by the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each Protection and Advocacy System that is a public system  without a multimember governing or advisory board must establish an  advisory council in order to provide a voice for individuals with  developmental disabilities. The Advisory Council shall advise the  Protection and Advocacy System on program policies and priorities. The  Advisory Council and Governing Board shall be comprised of a majority of  individuals with disabilities who are eligible for services, have  received or are receiving services, parents, family   members, guardians, advocates, or authorized representatives of such  individuals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Prior to any Federal review of the State program, a 30-day  notice and an opportunity for public comment must be published in the  Federal Register. Reasonable effort shall be made by AIDD to seek  comments through notification to major disability advocacy groups, the  State Bar, disability law resources, the State Councils on Developmental  Disabilities, and the University Centers for Excellence in Developmental  Disabilities Education, Research, and Service, for example, through  newsletters and publication of those organizations. The findings of  public comments may be consolidated if sufficiently similar issues are  raised and they shall be included in the report of the onsite visit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Before the Protection and Advocacy System releases information  to individuals not otherwise authorized to receive it, the Protection  and Advocacy System must obtain written consent from the client  requesting assistance or his or her guardian.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Contracts for program operations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An eligible P&A; system may  contract for the operation of part of its program with another public or  private nonprofit organization with demonstrated experience working with  individuals with developmental disabilities, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The eligible P&A; system institutes oversight and monitoring  procedures which ensure that any and all subcontractors will be able to  meet all applicable terms, conditions and obligations of the Federal  grant, including but not limited to the ability to pursue all forms of  litigation under the DD Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The P&A; exercises appropriate oversight to ensure that the  contracting organization meets all applicable responsibilities and  standards which apply to P&As;, including but not limited to, the  confidentiality provisions in the DD Act and regulations, ethical  responsibilities, program accountability and quality controls;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any eligible P&A; system should work cooperatively with existing  advocacy agencies and groups and, where appropriate, consider entering  into contracts for protection and advocacy services with organizations  already working on behalf of individuals with developmental  disabilities.</p>
