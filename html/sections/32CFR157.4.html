                            <p class="depth0">It is DoD policy that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individuals appropriately sponsored for a CAC consistent with DoD Manual 1000.13, Volume 1, ``DoD Identification Cards: ID Card Life-Cycle,'' January 23, 2014, (available at http://www.dtic.mil/ whs/directives/ corres/pdf/100013-- vol1.pdf) must be investigated and adjudicated in accordance with this part. Individuals not CAC eligible may be processed for local or regional base passes in accordance with Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) policy guidance for DoD physical access control consistent with DoD Regulation 5200.08-R, ``Physical Security Program'' (available at http://www.dtic.mil/ whs/directives/ corres/pdf/ 520008r.pdf) and local installation security policies and procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A favorably adjudicated National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) or equivalent in accordance with revised Federal investigative standards is the minimum investigation required for a final credentialing determination for a CAC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Individuals requiring a CAC must meet the credentialing standards in accordance with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Memorandum, ``Final Credentialing Standards for Issuing Personal Identity Verification Cards Under HSPD-12''; and U.S. Office of Personnel Management Memorandum, ``Introduction of Credentialing, Suitability, and Security Clearance Decision-Making Guide (available at http://www.opm.gov/investigate/resources/ decision_making_guide.pdf) and this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A CAC may be issued on an interim basis based on a favorable National Agency Check or a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Criminal History Check (fingerprint check) adjudicated by appropriate approved automated procedures or by a trained security or human resource (HR) specialist and successful submission to the investigative service provider (ISP) of a NACI, or a personnel security investigation (PSI) equal to or greater in scope than a NACI. Additionally, the CAC applicant must present two identity source documents, at least one of which is a valid Federal or State government-issued picture identification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The subsequent final credentialing determination will be made upon receipt of the completed investigation from the ISP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Discretionary judgments used to render an adjudicative determination for issuing the CAC are inherently governmental functions and must only be performed by trained U.S. Government personnel who have successfully completed required training and possess a minimum level of investigation (NACI or equivalent in accordance with revised Federal investigative standards). Established administrative processes in 32 CFR part 156 and DoD Directive 5220.6, ``Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program'' (available at http://www.dtic.mil/ whs/directives/corres/pdf/522006p.pdf) must be applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Adjudications rendered for eligibility for access to classified information, eligibility to hold a sensitive position, suitability, or fitness for Federal employment based on a NACI or higher level investigation may result in a concurrent CAC decision for that position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Favorable credentialing adjudications from another Federal department or agency will be reciprocally accepted in accordance with conditions stated in the procedural guidance in this part. Reciprocity must be based on final favorable adjudication only.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> CAC applicants or holders may appeal CAC denial or revocation in accordance with the conditions stated in the procedural guidance in this part. Appeals must be processed as indicated in the procedural guidance in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Non-U.S. nationals at foreign locations are not eligible to receive a CAC on an interim basis. Special considerations for conducting background investigations of non-U.S. nationals are addressed in U.S. OPM Memorandum, ``Final Credentialing Standards for Issuing Personal Identity Verification Cards Under HSPD-12.'' An interim

CAC may be issued to non-U.S. nationals in the U.S. or U.S. territories if they have resided in the U.S. or U.S. territory for at least 3 years, and they satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section and paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of Sec. 157.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Individuals who have been denied a CAC or have had a CAC revoked due to an unfavorable credentialing determination are eligible to reapply for a credential 1 year after the date of final adjudicative denial or revocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Individuals with a statutory or regulatory bar are not eligible for reconsideration while under debarment, see paragraph (d)(6) of Sec. 157.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The Deputy Secretary of Defense directed all reports of investigations conducted as required for compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, ``Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors'' (available at http://www.dhs.gov/ homeland- security- presidential- directive-12) to be sent to the consolidated DoD Central Adjudications Facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> When eligibility is denied or revoked, CACs shall be recovered whenever practicable, and shall immediately be rendered inoperable. In addition, agencies' physical and logical access systems shall be immediately updated to eliminate the use of a CAC for access.</p>
