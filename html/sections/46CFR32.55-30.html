                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Venting required. On all tank vessels, the construction or alteration of which is started on or after November 10, 1936, and prior to July 1, 1951, each cargo tank shall be equipped with a vent. The details of the venting system shall meet the requirements of this section, or alternatively, the requirements of either Sec. 32.55-20 or Sec. 32.55-25, as applicable, shall be met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grade A liquids. (1) Cargo tanks in which Grade A liquids are to be transported shall be fitted with a venting system consisting of branch vent line from each cargo tank connected to a vent header which shall extend to a reasonable height above the weather deck and be fitted with a flame arrester or pressure-vacuum relief valve. Each branch vent line may be provided with a manually operated control valve, provided it is bypassed with a pressure-vacuum relief valve or each cargo tank to which such a branch vent line is connected is fitted with an independent pressure-vacuum relief valve. The vent header system shall be provided with suitable connections for flushing and draining.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cargo tanks in which Grade A liquids are to be transported shall be fitted with a venting system consisting of branch vent line from each cargo tank connected to a vent header which shall extend to a reasonable height above the weather deck and be fitted with a flame arrester or pressure-vacuum relief valve. Each branch vent line may be provided with a manually operated control valve, provided it is bypassed with a pressure-vacuum relief valve or each cargo tank to which such a branch vent line is connected is fitted with an independent pressure-vacuum relief valve. The vent header system shall be provided with suitable connections for flushing and draining.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In barges with independent tanks carrying Grade A liquids, separate discharge pipes may be fitted to each pressure-vacuum relief valve, or the pressure-vacuum relief valve may be elevated, so that in either case the discharge from such valve will not be less than 7 feet above the deck where practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Grade B or C liquids. Cargo tanks in which Grade B or C liquids are to be transported shall be fitted with individual pressure-vacuum relief valves or shall be fitted with a venting system consisting of branch vent lines connected to a vent header which shall extend to a reasonable height above the weather deck and be fitted with a flame arrester or a pressure-vacuum relief valve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Grade D or E liquids. Cargo tanks in which Grade D or E liquids only are to be transported shall be fitted with gooseneck vents and flame screens unless such tanks are vented by pressure-vacuum relief valves or a venting system of branch vent lines and a vent header.</p>
