                            <p class="depth0">If a new concessioner is awarded a leasehold surrender interest concession contract and is required to pay a prior concessioner for possessory interest in real property improvements, the new concessioner will have a leasehold surrender interest in the real property improvements under the terms of its new concession contract. The initial value

of the leasehold surrender interest (instead of initial construction cost) will be the value of the possessory interest as of the expiration or other termination of the 1965 Act possessory interest concession contract. This leasehold surrender interest will apply even if the related possessory interest real property improvements are not capital improvements as defined in this part. In the event a new concessioner obtains a leasehold surrender interest in only a portion of a structure as a result of the acquisition of a possessory interest from a prior concessioner, depreciation for purposes of leasehold surrender interest value will apply only to the portion of the structure to which the possessory interest applied.</p>
