                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In considering requests to make available financing with an interest rate as low as 2 percent, and extended repayment terms, the Administrator will evaluate the effect of and need for such terms on the finding of financial feasibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In considering a request for a non-duplication waiver, the Administrator will consider the offerings of all existing service providers to determine whether or not granting the non-duplication waiver is warranted. A waiver of non-duplication restrictions will not be given if the Administrator determines as a matter of financial feasibility that, taking into account all existing service providers, an applicant or RUS borrower would not be able to repay a loan or successfully implement a grant agreement. Requests for waivers of non-duplication restrictions will be reviewed by taking the following factors into consideration:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The size, extent and demographics of the duplicative area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cost of service from existing service providers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The quality of available service; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The ability of the existing service provider to serve the eligible service area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests for waivers of matching fund requirements will be evaluated by taking the following factors into consideration:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether waivers or reductions in matching or equity requirements would make an otherwise financially infeasible project financially feasible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether permitting a matching requirement to be met with sources not otherwise permitted in an affected program due to regulatory prohibition may be allowed under a separate statutory authority; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the application could be ranked and scored as if the matching requirements were fully met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requests for waivers of credit support requirements will be evaluated taking the following factors into consideration:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost and availability of credit support relative to the loan security derived from such support;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The extent to which the requirement is shown to be a barrier to the applicant's participation in the program; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The alternatives to waiving the requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Administrator may adapt the manner of assigning highest funding priority to align with the selection methods used for particular programs or funding opportunities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligible programs which use priority point scoring may, in a notice of funds availability or similar notice, assign extra points for SUTA eligible applicants as a means to exercise a discretionary authority under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator may announce a competitive grant opportunity focused exclusively or primarily on trust lands which incorporates one or more discretionary authorities under this subpart into the rules or scoring for the competition.</p>
