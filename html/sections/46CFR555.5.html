                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An investigation to determine the existence of adverse  conditions as described in Sec. 555.3 may be initiated by the  Commission on its own motion or on the petition of any person pursuant  to Sec. 555.4. An investigation shall be considered to have been  initiated for the purpose of the time limits imposed by the Foreign  Shipping Practices Act of 1988 upon the publication in the Federal  Register of the Commission's notice of investigation, which shall  announce the initiation of the proceeding upon either the Commission's  own motion or the filing of a petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of part 502 of this chapter (Rules of Practice  and Procedure) shall not apply to this part except for those provisions  governing ex parte communications (Sec. 502.11 of this chapter) and  except as the Commission may otherwise determine by order. The precise  procedures and timetables for participation in investigations initiated  under this part will be established on an ad hoc basis as appropriate  and set forth in the notice. Proceedings may include oral evidentiary  hearings, but only when the Commission determines that there are likely  to be genuine issues of material fact that cannot   be resolved on the basis of written submissions, or that the nature of  the matter in issue is such that an oral hearing and cross-examination  are necessary for the development of an adequate record. In any event,  investigations initiated under this part shall proceed expeditiously,  consistent with due process, to conform with the time limits specified  in the Foreign Shipping Practices Act and to identify promptly the  conditions described in Sec. 555.3 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon initiation of an investigation, interested persons will be  given the opportunity to participate in the proceeding pursuant to the  procedures set forth in the notice. Submissions filed in response to a  notice of investigation may include written data and statistics, views,  and legal arguments. Factual information submitted shall be certified  under oath. An original and 15 copies of such submissions will be filed  with the Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573.  Persons who receive information requests from the Commission pursuant to  Sec. 555.6 of this part are not precluded from filing additional  voluntary submissions in accordance with this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An investigation shall be completed and a decision rendered  within 120 days after it has commenced as defined in paragraph (a) of  this section, unless the Commission determines that an additional 90-day  period is necessary in order to obtain sufficient information on which  to render a decision. When the Commission determines to extend the  investigation period for an additional 90 days, it shall issue a notice  clearly stating the reasons therefor.  [54 FR 11533, Mar. 21, 1989.
