When controls do not reduce a miner's DPM exposure to the PEL, controls are infeasible, or controls do not produce significant reductions in DPM exposures, controls must be used to reduce the miner's exposure to as low a level as feasible and must be supplemented with respiratory protection in accordance with Sec. 57.5005(a), (b), and paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Air purifying respirators must be equipped with the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Filters certified by NIOSH under 30 CFR part 11 (appearing in the July 1, 1994 edition of 30 CFR, parts 1 to 199) as a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Filters certified by NIOSH under 42 CFR part 84 as 99.97% efficient; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Filters certified by NIOSH for DPM.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Non-powered, negative-pressure, air purifying, particulate-filter respirators shall use an R- or P-series filter or any filter certified by NIOSH for DPM.
