However, for any representations of matched-system efficiency that exceed the refrigeration system rating as determined by the unit cooler testing provisions at 10 CFR 431.304(c)(12) and for which a manufacturer wishes to make representations of the more-efficient rating, then the matched refrigeration system must be tested separately in accordance with the DOE test procedure for matched systems and applicable sampling plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> WICF components other than those specified in (a)(1) of this section--(i) Units to be tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Units to be tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The general requirements of Sec. 429.11 apply; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For each basic model selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any represented value of energy consumption or other measure of energy use of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The mean of the sample, where:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13MY14.004</p><p class="depth0">and, xx is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13MY14.005</p><p class="depth0">And xx is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95% one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from Appendix A to subpart B).
