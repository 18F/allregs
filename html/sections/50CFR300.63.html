Any approved CSP may be obtained from the Administrator, West Coast Region, NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> Each year, before January 1, NMFS will publish a proposal to govern the recreational fishery under the CSP for the following year and will seek public comment. The comment period will extend until after the Commission's annual meeting, so the public will have the opportunity to consider the final area 2A total allowable catch (TAC) before submitting comments. After the Commission's annual meeting and review of public comments, NMFS will publish in the Federal Register the final rule governing sport fishing in area 2A. Annual management measures may be adjusted inseason by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each year, before January 1, NMFS will publish a proposal to govern the recreational fishery under the CSP for the following year and will seek public comment.

Each year the landing restrictions necessary to keep the fishery within its allocation will be recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management Council at its spring meetings, and will be published in the Federal Register along with the annual salmon management measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A portion of the Area 2A Washington recreational TAC is allocated as incidental catch in the sablefish primary fishery north of 4653.30' N. lat, (Pt. Chehalis, Washington), which is regulated under 50 CFR 660.231. This fishing opportunity is only available in years in which the Area 2A TAC is greater than 900,000 lb (408.2 mt,) provided that a minimum of 10,000 lb (4.5 mt) is available above a Washington recreational TAC of 214,100 lb (97.1 mt). Each year that this harvest is available, the landing restrictions necessary to keep this fishery within its allocation will be recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management Council at its spring meetings, and will be published in the Federal Register. These restrictions will be designed to ensure the halibut harvest is incidental to the sablefish harvest and will be based on the amounts of halibut and sablefish available to this fishery, and other pertinent factors. The restrictions may include catch or landing ratios, landing limits, or other means to control the rate of halibut landings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In years when this incidental harvest of halibut in the sablefish primary fishery north of 4653.30 N. lat. is allowed, it is allowed only for vessels using longline gear that are registered to groundfish limited entry permits with sablefish endorsements and that possess the appropriate incidental halibut harvest license issued by the Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It is unlawful for any person to possess, land or purchase halibut south of 4653.30 N. lat. that were taken and retained as incidental catch authorized by this section in the sablefish primary fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The commercial longline fishery in area 2A is governed by the annual management measures published pursuant to Sec.

These broadcasts are announced on Channel 16 VHF-FM and 2182 kHz at frequent intervals. The announcements designate the channel or frequency over which the notice to mariners will be immediately broadcast. Since provisions of these regulations may be altered by inseason actions, sport fishers should monitor either the telephone hotline or U.S. Coast Guard broadcasts for current information for the area in which they are fishing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effective dates.

However, no inseason action has any effect beyond the end of the calendar year in which it is issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Availability of data.
