                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The State agency shall ensure that corrective action plans are  prepared at the project area/management unit level, addressing those  deficiencies not required to be included in the State corrective action  plan. State agencies may elect to prepare these plans for or in  cooperation with the project area. These project area/management unit  corrective action plans shall be open-ended and shall remain in effect  until all deficiencies in program operations have been reduced  substantially or eliminated. Any deficiencies detected through any  source not previously reported to the State agency which require  incorporation into the Project Area/Management Unit Corrective Action  Plan shall be submitted to the State agency within 60 days of  identification. As deficiencies are reduced substantially or eliminated,  the project area/management unit shall notify the State agency in  writing. The project area/management unit shall be responsible for  documenting why each deficiency is being removed from the Plan. The  removal of any deficiency from the Plan will be subject to State agency  and FNS review and validation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content. Project area/management unit corrective action plans  shall contain all the information necessary to enable the State agency  to monitor and evaluate the corrective action properly. Also, State  agencies shall establish requirements for project area/management units  in planning, implementing and reporting corrective action to assist the  State agency's efforts to fulfill its responsibilities for determining  which deficiencies must be addressed in the State corrective action  plan. States should consider requiring project area/management unit  plans to include the following, based on the most recent information  available:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specific description and identification of each deficiency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Source(s) through which the deficiency was detected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Geographic extent of the deficiency (throughout the project  area/management unit or only in specific offices);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Identification of causal factor(s) contributing to the  occurrence of each deficiency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Identification of any action already completed to eliminate the  deficiency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For each deficiency, an outline of actions to be taken, the  expected outcome of each action, the target date for each action, the  date by which each deficiency will have been eliminated; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For each deficiency, a description of the manner in which the  project area/management unit will monitor and evaluate the effectiveness  of the corrective action in eliminating the deficiency.
