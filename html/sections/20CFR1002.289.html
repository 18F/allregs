                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In carrying out any investigation, VETS has, at all reasonable  times, reasonable access to and the right to interview persons with  information relevant to the investigation. VETS also has reasonable  access to, for purposes of examination, the right to copy and receive  any documents of any person or employer that VETS considers relevant to  the investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> VETS may require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of  witnesses and the production of documents relating to any matter under  investigation. In case of disobedience of or resistance to the subpoena,  the Attorney General may, at VETS' request, apply to any district court  of the United States in whose jurisdiction such disobedience or  resistance occurs for an order enforcing the subpoena. The district  courts of the United States have jurisdiction to order compliance with  the subpoena, and to punish failure to obey a subpoena as a contempt of  court. This paragraph does not authorize VETS to seek issuance of a  subpoena to the legislative or judicial branches of the United States.</p>
