The application must be accompanied by the appropriate fee and submitted in accordance with Sec. 1.913 of this chapter. Beginning May 20, 2013, First and Second Class Radiotelegraph Operator's Certificates will be renewed as Radiotelegraph Operator Licenses, and Third Class Radiotelegraph Operator's Certificates will be renewed as Marine Radio Operator Permits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a license expires, application for renewal may be made during a grace period of five years after the expiration date without having to retake the required examinations. The application must be accompanied by the required fee and submitted in accordance with Sec. 1.913 of this chapter. During the grace period, the expired license is not valid. A license renewed during the grace period will be effective as of the date of the renewal. Licensees who fail to renew their licenses within the grace period must apply for a new license and take the required examination(s). Beginning May 20, 2013, no applications for new First, Second, or Third Class Radiotelegraph Operator's Certificates will be accepted for filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each application involving a change in operator class must be filed on FCC Form 605.

The application must include an original PPC(s) from a COLEM(s) showing that the applicant has passed the necessary examination Element(s) within the previous 365 days when the applicant files the application. If a COLEM files the application on behalf of the applicant, an original PPC(s) is not required. However, the COLEM must keep the PPC(s) on file for a period of 1 year. When acting on behalf of qualified examinees, the COLEM must forward all required data to the FCC electronically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Provided that a person's commercial radio operator license was not revoked, or suspended, and is not the subject of an ongoing suspension proceeding, a person holding a General Radiotelephone Operator License, Marine Radio Operator Permit, First Class Radiotelegraph Operator's Certificate, Second Class Radiotelegraph Operator's Certificate, Third Class Radiotelegraph Operator's Certificate, Radiotelegraph Operator License, GMDSS Radio Operator's License, GMDSS Radio Maintainer's License, or GMDSS Radio Operator/Maintainer License, who has an application for another commercial radio operator license which has not yet been acted upon pending at the FCC and who holds a PPC(s) indicating that he or she passed the necessary examination(s) within the previous 365 days, is authorized to exercise the rights and privileges of the license for which the application is filed. This temporary conditional operating authority is valid for a period of 90 days from the date the application is received.

The FCC, in its discretion, may cancel this temporary conditional operating authority without a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An applicant will be given credit for an examination element as specified below:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An unexpired (or within the grace period) FCC-issued commercial radio operator license: Except as noted in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the written examination and telegraphy Element(s) required to obtain the license held;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An expired or unexpired FCC-issued Amateur Extra Class operator license grant granted before April 15, 2000: Telegraphy Elements 1 and 2; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An FCC-issued Third Class Radiotelegraph Operator's Certificate that was renewed as a Marine Radio Operator Permit (see Sec. 13.13(b) of this chapter) that is unexpired (or within the grace period): Telegraphy Elements 1 and 2.
