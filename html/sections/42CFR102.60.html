                            <p class="depth0">A requester deemed eligible by the Secretary who seeks payment or reimbursement for medical services or items must submit the following, in addition to the documentation submitted under subpart F:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> List of third-party payors. The requester must submit a list of all third-party payors that may have an obligation to pay for or provide any medical services or items for which payment or reimbursement is being sought under this Program. Such third-party payors may include, but are not limited to, health maintenance organizations, health insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, and other entities obligated to provide medical services or items or recompense individuals for medical expenses. Such a list must include the individual's account numbers and other applicable information. If the requester knows of no such third-party payor, he or she must certify to that fact. If the requester becomes aware that a third-party payor may have such an obligation, the requester must inform the Secretary within 10 business days of becoming aware of this information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Documents for medical services or items provided in the past. A requester seeking payment or reimbursement for medical services or items provided in the past must submit an itemized statement from each health care entity (e.g., clinic, hospital, doctor, or pharmacy) and third-party payor listing the services or items provided to diagnose or treat the covered injury or its health complications and the amounts paid or expected to be paid by third parties for such services or items (e.g., an Explanation of Benefits from the individual's health insurance company). If no third-party payor has an obligation to pay for or provide such services or items, the requester must certify to that fact and submit an itemized list of the services or items provided (including the total cost of such services or items). To assist the Secretary in making a determination as to whether such services or items were reasonable and necessary to diagnose or treat a covered injury or its health complications, the requester may submit, in addition to the required medical records, documentation showing that a health care practitioner prescribed or recommended such services or items. The medical records must support the requested services and items;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Documents for medical services and items expected to be provided in the future. A requester seeking payments for medical services or items expected to be provided in the future must submit a statement from one or more health care practitioner(s) (e.g., a treating neurologist for neurologic issues and a treating cardiologist for cardiologic issues) describing those services and items that appear likely to be needed to diagnose or treat the covered injury or its health complications in the future. The medical records must support the requested services and items. A requester must submit documentation, if available, concerning the likely cost of, and the amount expected to be paid by third-party payors for, such services or items.</p>
