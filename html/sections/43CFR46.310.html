If the adjustments to an action are clearly articulated and pre-specified in the description of the alternative and fully analyzed, then the action may be adjusted during implementation without the need for further analysis. Adaptive management includes a monitoring component, approved adaptive actions that may be taken, and environmental effects analysis for the adaptive actions approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The level of detail and depth of impact analysis should normally be limited to the minimum needed to determine whether there would be significant environmental effects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Bureaus may choose to provide additional detail and depth of analysis as appropriate in those environmental assessments prepared under paragraph 46.300(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An environmental assessment must contain objective analyses that support conclusions concerning environmental impacts.</p>
