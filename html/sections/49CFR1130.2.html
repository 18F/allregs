                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Actual filing required. Notification to the Board that an informal complaint may or will be filed later seeking damages is not a filing within the meaning of the statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content. An informal complaint seeking damages must be filed within the statutory period, and should identify with reasonable definiteness the involved shipments or transportation services. The complaint should include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement that complainant seeks to recover damages;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The names of each individual seeking damages;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The names and addresses of defendants against which claim is made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The commodities, the rate applied, the date on which the charges were paid, the names of the parties paying the charges, and, if different, the names of the parties bearing the charges;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The period of time within which or the specific dates upon which the shipments were made, and the dates when they were delivered or tendered for delivery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The specific origin and destination points or, where they are numerous, the territorial or rate group of the origin and destination points and, if known, the routes of movement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The nature and amount of the injury sustained by each claimant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statement of prior claim.

If an informal complaint seeking damages (other than a contested tariff reconciliation petition) cannot be disposed of informally or is denied or withdrawn by complainant, the parties affected will be so notified in writing by the Board. Contested tariff reconciliation petitions either will be granted or denied by the entry of a decision. Unless within six months after the date on which a notice is mailed or a decision is served, a party either files a formal complaint or resubmits its informal complaint on an additional-fact basis, the matter in the complaint or petition will not be reconsidered. The claim will be considered abandoned and no complaint seeking damages on the same cause of action will be accepted unless filed within the statutory period. Any filing or resubmission satisfying the six months' requirement will be considered filed as of the date of the original filing and must specifically refer to that date and to the Board's file number. An original and 10 copies of a petition for reconsideration should be filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Tariff reconciliation proceedings for motor common carriers--(1) Petitions to waive collection or permit payment.
