The Administrator may, on the basis of written application by a manufacturer, establish special test procedures other than those set forth in this part, for any nonroad engine that the Administrator determines is not susceptible to satisfactory testing under the specified test procedures set forth in subpart E of this part or 40 CFR part 86, subpart I.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alternate test procedures. (1) A manufacturer may elect to use an alternate test procedure provided that it yields equivalent results to the specified procedures, its use is approved in

advance by the Administrator, and the basis for equivalent results with the specified test procedures is fully described in the manufacturer's application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A manufacturer may elect to use an alternate test procedure provided that it yields equivalent results to the specified procedures, its use is approved in

advance by the Administrator, and the basis for equivalent results with the specified test procedures is fully described in the manufacturer's application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator may reject data generated under alternate test procedures which do not correlate with data generated under the specified procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A manufacturer may elect to use the test procedures in 40 CFR part 1065 as an alternate test procedure without advance approval by the Administrator. The manufacturer must identify in its application for certification that the engines were tested using the procedures in 40 CFR part 1065. For any EPA testing with Tier 2 or Tier 3 engines, EPA will use the manufacturer's selected procedures for mapping engines, generating duty cycles, and applying cycle-validation criteria. For any other parameters, EPA may conduct testing using either of the specified procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where we specify mandatory compliance with the procedures of 40 CFR part 1065, such as in Sec. 89.419, manufacturers may elect to use the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N, as an alternate test procedure without advance approval by the Administrator.
