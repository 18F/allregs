                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Loans to organizations which will provide sites for self-help  housing (RHS sec. 523 loans) will be made under the provisions of this  subpart with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility. The applicant must be a nonprofit organization  engaged in assisting self-help projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interest. The interest rate will be 3 percent per annum on the  unpaid principal balance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Source of funds. These will be direct loans made from the self- help fund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Evidence of need. Loans to newly formed organizations will be  made on the basis of the applicant's providing firm information as to  the number of sites to be developed and the names of eligible bona fide  prospective purchasers who are assured of available home financing.  Loans to organizations currently involved in mutual self-help housing  projects may be made without submitting a list of the names of  prospective site purchasers. There must, however, be definite evidence  that enough families are available who are eligible and who will buy the  sites when they are developed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Multiple advances. These loans may be disbursed over a period  not to exceed 18 months from the date of the first advance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Note forms. Form RD 3560-52, ``Multiple Family Housing  Promissory Note,'' will be used. See Sec. 1822.274 (c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Mortgage. Unless the OGC determines the Form to be  inappropriate, real estate mortgage Form FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 1927-1 (state), ``Real Estate ---------- for -- -------- (Direct Loan),'' will be used modified as prescribed by or with  the advice of the OGC with respect to the name, address, and other  identification of the borrower, the style of execution, and the  acknowledgement. Additional paragraphs will be included in the mortgage  to read as follows:</p><p class="depth2">The borrower agrees not to discriminate in the sale of the dwelling  financed under this mortgage due to a prospective purchaser's race,  color, national origin, sex, religion, age, marital status, or handicap.  The borrower further agrees to comply with all Federal, State, or local  laws and ordinances prohibiting discrimination in the sale of housing.  The borrower's failure or refusal to comply with this agreement will be  a basis for the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to  deny future requests   for participation in its rural housing programs and activities.</p><p class="depth2">This instrument also secures the obligations and covenants of  borrower set forth in Borrower's Loan Resolution of -------- (date),  which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
