Records subject to the Privacy Act which  are used in making any determination about any individual shall be  maintained with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness  as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in  making the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Collection of information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information which may be used in  making determination about an individual's rights, benefits, and  privileges under Federal programs shall, to the greatest extent  practicable, be collected directly from that individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In deciding whether collection of information from an  individual, as opposed to a third party source, is practicable, the  following factors, among others may be considered:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the nature of the information sought is such that it can  only be obtained from a third party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the cost of collecting the information from the  individual is unreasonable when compared with the cost of collecting it  from a third party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether there is a risk that information collected from third  parties if inaccurate, could result in an adverse determination to the  individual concerned;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the information, if supplied by the individual, would  have to be verified by a third party; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Whether provisions can be made for verification, by the  individual, of information collected from third parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Advice to individual concerning uses of information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each  individual who is asked to supply information about himself which will  be added to a system of records shall be informed of the basis for  requesting the information, how it may be used, and what the  consequences, if any, are of not supplying the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At a minimum, the notice to the individual must state;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The authority (whether granted by statute or Executive Order of  the President) which authorizes the solicitation of the information and  whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is  intended to be used;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The routine uses which may be made of the information; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The effects on him, if any, of not providing all or any part of  the requested information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When information is collected on a standard form, the notice  to the individual shall be on the form or on a tear-off sheet attached  to the form or on a separate sheet, whichever is most practical.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When information is collected by an interviewer, the  interviewer shall provide the individual with a written notice which the  individual may retain. If the interview is conducted by telephone,  however, the interviewer may summarize the notice for the individual and  need not provide a copy to the individual unless the individual requests  that a copy be mailed to him.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An individual may be asked to acknowledge, in writing, that he  has been afforded the notice required by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Records concerning activity protected by the First Amendment.
