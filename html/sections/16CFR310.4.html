                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Abusive conduct generally. It is an abusive telemarketing act or  practice and a violation of this Rule for any seller or telemarketer to  engage in the following conduct:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Threats, intimidation, or the use of profane or obscene  language;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requesting or receiving payment of any fee or consideration for  goods or services represented to remove derogatory information from, or  improve, a person's credit history, credit record, or credit rating  until:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The time frame in which the seller has represented all of the  goods or services will be provided to that person has expired; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The seller has provided the person with documentation in the  form of a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency demonstrating  that the promised results have been achieved, such report having been  issued more than six months after the results were achieved. Nothing in  this Rule should be construed to affect the requirement in the Fair  Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681, that a consumer report may only be  obtained for a specified permissible purpose;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Requesting or receiving payment of any fee or consideration from  a person for goods or services represented to recover or otherwise  assist in the return of money or any other item of value paid for by, or  promised to, that person in a previous telemarketing transaction, until  seven (7) business days after such money or other item is delivered to  that person. This provision shall not apply to goods or services  provided to a person by a licensed attorney;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Requesting or receiving payment of any fee or consideration in  advance of obtaining a loan or other extension of credit when the seller  or telemarketer has guaranteed or represented a high likelihood of  success in obtaining or arranging a loan or other extension of credit  for a person;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Requesting or receiving payment of any fee or consideration  for any debt relief service until and unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The seller or telemarketer has renegotiated, settled, reduced,  or otherwise altered the terms of at least one debt pursuant to a  settlement agreement, debt management plan, or other such valid  contractual agreement executed by the customer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The customer has made at least one payment pursuant to that  settlement agreement, debt management plan, or other valid contractual  agreement between the customer and the creditor or debt collector; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> To the extent that debts enrolled in a service are renegotiated,  settled, reduced, or otherwise altered individually, the fee or  consideration either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Bears the same proportional relationship to the total fee for  renegotiating, settling, reducing, or altering the terms of the entire  debt balance as the individual debt amount bears to the entire debt  amount. The individual debt amount and the entire debt amount are those  owed at the time the debt was enrolled in the service; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is a percentage of the amount saved as a result of the  renegotiation, settlement, reduction, or alteration. The percentage  charged cannot change from one individual debt to another. The amount  saved is the difference between the amount owed at the time the debt was  enrolled in the service and the amount actually paid to satisfy the  debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nothing in Sec. 310.4(a)(5)(i) prohibits requesting or  requiring the customer to place funds in an account to be used for the  debt relief provider's fees and for payments to creditors or debt  collectors in connection with the renegotiation, settlement, reduction,  or other alteration of the terms of payment or other terms of a debt,  provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The funds are held in an account at an insured financial  institution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The customer owns the funds held in the account and is paid  accrued interest on the account, if any;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The entity administering the account is not owned or controlled  by, or in any way affiliated with, the debt relief service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The entity administering the account does not give or accept any  money or other compensation in exchange for referrals of business  involving the debt relief service; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The customer may withdraw from the debt relief service at any  time without penalty, and must receive all funds in the account, other  than funds earned by the debt relief service in compliance with Sec.  310.4(a)(5)(i)(A) through (C), within seven (7) business days of the  customer's request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Disclosing or receiving, for consideration, unencrypted consumer  account numbers for use in telemarketing; provided, however, that this  paragraph shall not apply to the disclosure or receipt of a customer's  or donor's billing information to process a payment for goods or  services or a charitable contribution pursuant to a transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)(i)</em> through (ii) of this section must be met to  evidence express informed consent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In any telemarketing transaction involving preacquired account  information and a free-to-pay conversion feature, the seller or  telemarketer must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Obtain from the customer, at a minimum, the last four (4) digits  of the account number to be charged;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Obtain from the customer his or her express agreement to be  charged for the goods or services and to be charged using the account  number pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(i)(A) of this section; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Make and maintain an audio recording of the entire telemarketing  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In any other telemarketing transaction involving preacquired  account information not described in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this  section, the seller or telemarketer must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At a minimum, identify the account to be charged with sufficient  specificity for the customer or donor to understand what account will be  charged; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Obtain from the customer or donor his or her express agreement  to be charged for the goods or services and to be charged using the  account number identified pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this  section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Failing to transmit or cause to be transmitted the telephone  number, and, when made available by the telemarketer's carrier, the name  of the telemarketer, to any caller identification service in use by a  recipient of a telemarketing call; provided that it shall not be a  violation to substitute (for the name and phone number used in, or  billed for, making the call) the name of the seller or charitable  organization on behalf of which a telemarketing call is placed, and the  seller's or charitable organization's customer or donor service  telephone number, which is answered during regular business hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Pattern of calls. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is an abusive telemarketing act or  practice and a violation of this Rule for a telemarketer to engage in,  or for a seller to cause a telemarketer to engage in, the following  conduct:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Causing any telephone to ring, or engaging any person in  telephone conversation, repeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy,  abuse, or harass any person at the called number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Denying or interfering in any way, directly or indirectly, with  a person's right to be placed on any registry of names and/or telephone  numbers of persons who do not wish to receive outbound telephone calls  established to comply with Sec. 310.4(b)(1)(iii);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Initiating any outbound telephone call to a person when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That person previously has stated that he or she does not wish  to receive an outbound telephone call made by or on behalf of the seller  whose goods or services are being offered or made on behalf of the  charitable organization for which a charitable contribution is being  solicited; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That person's telephone number is on the ``do-not-call''  registry, maintained by the Commission, of persons who do not wish to  receive outbound telephone calls to induce the purchase of goods or  services unless the seller:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Has obtained the express agreement, in writing, of such person  to place calls to that person. Such written agreement shall clearly  evidence such person's authorization that calls made by or on behalf of  a specific party may be placed to that person, and shall include the  telephone number to which the calls may be placed and the signature\664\  of that person; or ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\664\ For purposes of this Rule, the term ``signature'' shall  include an electronic or digital form of signature, to the extent that  such form of signature is recognized as a valid signature under  applicable federal law or state contract law. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has an established business relationship with such person, and  that person has not stated that he or she does not wish to receive  outbound telephone calls under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Abandoning any outbound telephone call. An outbound telephone  call is ``abandoned'' under this section if a person answers it and the  telemarketer does not connect the call to a sales representative within  two (2) seconds of the person's completed greeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Initiating any outbound telephone call that delivers a  prerecorded message, other than a prerecorded message permitted for  compliance with the call abandonment safe harbor in Sec.  310.4(b)(4)(iii), unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In any such call to induce the purchase of any good or service,  the seller has obtained from the recipient of the call an express  agreement, in writing, that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The seller obtained only after a clear and conspicuous  disclosure that the purpose of the agreement is to authorize the seller  to place prerecorded calls to such person;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The seller obtained without requiring, directly or indirectly,  that the agreement be executed as a condition of purchasing any good or  service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Evidences the willingness of the recipient of the call to  receive calls that deliver prerecorded messages by or on behalf of a  specific seller; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Includes such person's telephone number and signature;\665\ and ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\665\ For purposes of this Rule, the term ``signature'' shall  include an electronic or digital form of signature, to the extent that  such form of signature is recognized as a valid signature under  applicable federal law or state contract law. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In any such call to induce the purchase of any good or service,  or to induce a charitable contribution from a member of, or previous  donor to, a non-profit charitable organization on whose behalf the call  is made, the seller or telemarketer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Allows the telephone to ring for at least fifteen (15) seconds  or four (4) rings before disconnecting an unanswered call; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Within two (2) seconds after the completed greeting of the  person called, plays a prerecorded message that promptly provides the  disclosures required by Sec. 310.4(d) or (e), followed immediately by a  disclosure of one or both of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> at any time during the  message.
