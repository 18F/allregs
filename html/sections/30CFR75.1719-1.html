                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each operator of an underground coal mine shall provide each working place in the mine with lighting as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 75.1719-1 and 75.1719-2 while self-propelled mining equipment is operated in the working place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Self-propelled mining equipment; definition. For the purposes of Sec. Sec. 75.1719 through 75.1719-4, ``self-propelled mining equipment'' means equipment which possesses the capability of moving itself or its associated components from one location to another by electric, hydraulic, pneumatic, or mechanical power supplied by a source located on the machine or transmitted to the machine by cables, ropes, or chains.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The lighting prescribed in this section shall be in addition to that provided by personal cap lamps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The luminous intensity (surface brightness) of surfaces that are in a miner's normal field of vision of areas in working places that are required to be lighted shall be not less than 0.06 footlamberts when measured in accordance with Sec. 75.1719-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When self-propelled mining equipment specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(6) of this section is operated in a working place, the areas within a miner's normal field of vision which shall be illuminated in the working place shall be as prescribed in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Continuous miners and coal-loading equipment. In working places in which continuous miners and coal-loading equipment are operated, the areas which shall be illuminated shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The face, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ribs, roof, floor, and exposed surface of mining equipment, which are between the face and the inby end of the shuttle car or other conveying equipment while in position to receive material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Self-loading haulage equipment used as a loading machine. In working places in which self-loading haulage equipment is operated to load material, the areas which shall be illuminated shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The face, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ribs, roof, floor, and exposed surfaces of mining equipment, which are between the face and a point 5 feet outby the machine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cutting and drilling equipment. In working places in which cutting or drilling equipment is operated, the areas which shall be illuminated shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The ribs, roof, floor, and exposed surfaces of mining equipment, which are between the face and a point 5 feet outby the machine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Shortwall and longwall mining equipment. In working places in which shortwall or longwall mining equipment is operated, the areas which shall be illuminated shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The area for the length of the self-advancing roof suport system and which is between the gob-side of the travelway and the side of the block of coal from which coal is being extracted, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The control station, and the head piece and tail piece of the face conveyor, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The roof and floor for a distance of 5 feet horizontally from the control station, head piece and tail piece.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Roof bolting equipment. In working places in which roof bolting equipment is operated, the areas which shall be illuminated shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where the distance from the floor, to the roof is 5 feet, or less: the face, ribs, roof, floor, and exposed surfaces of

mining equipment, which are within an area the perimeter of which is a distance of 5 feet from the machine, when measured parallel to the floor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where the distance from the floor to the roof is more than 5 feet: the face, ribs, roof, floor, and exposed surfaces of mining equipment, which are within an area the perimeter of which from the front and sides of the machine is a distance equal to the distance from the floor to the roof and from the rear of the machine a distance of 5 feet, when measured parallel to the floor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other self-propelled equipment. Unless the entire working place is illuminated by stationary lighting equipment, in working places in which self-propelled equipment is operated, other than equipment specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section, illumination shall be provided as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Luminaires shall be installed on each machine operated in the working place which shall illuminate a face or rib coal surface which is within 10 feet of the front and the rear of the machine to a luminous intensity of not less than 0.06 footlamberts, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The height and width of the area of the coal surface which shall be illuminated shall equal the height and width, respectively, of the machine on which the luminaires are installed, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The luminaires in the direction of travel shall be operated at all times the equipment is being trammed in the working place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Administrator, Coal Mine Health and Safety, MSHA, may specify other areas in a working place to be illuminated for the protection of miners while self-propelled mining equipment is being operated in the working place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Surface brightness of floor, roof, coal and machine surfaces in the normal visual field of a miner shall not vary more than 50 percent between adjacent fields of similar surface reflectance, and the maximum surface brightness of such surface shall not exceed 120 footlamberts when measured in accordance with Sec. 75.1719-3.
