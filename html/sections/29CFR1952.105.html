                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a result of the Assistant Secretary's determination granting final approval to the Oregon State Plan under Section 18(e) of the Act, effective May 12, 2005, occupational safety and health standards which have been promulgated under Section 6 of the Act (with the exception of those applicable to temporary labor camps in agriculture, general industry, construction and logging) do not apply with respect to issues covered under the Oregon plan. This determination also relinquishes concurrent Federal OSHA authority to issue citations for violations of such standards under Sections 5(a)(2) and 9 of the Act; to conduct inspections and investigations under Section 8 (except those necessary to evaluate the plan under Section 18(f) and other inspections, investigations, or proceedings necessary to carry out Federal responsibilities not specifically preempted by Section 18(e)); to conduct enforcement proceedings in contested cases under Section 10; to institute proceedings to correct imminent dangers under Section 13; and to propose civil penalties or initiate criminal proceedings for violations of the Act under Section 17. The Assistant Secretary retains jurisdiction under the above provisions in any proceeding commenced under Section 9 or 10 before the effective date of the 18(e) determination. The Operational Status Agreement, effective January 23, 1975, and as amended, effective December 12, 1983 and November 27, 1991, is superseded by this action, except that it will continue to apply to temporary labor camps in agriculture, general industry, construction and logging.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> In accordance with Section 18(e), final approval relinquishes Federal OSHA authority with regard to occupational safety and health issues covered by the Oregon plan (with the exception of temporary labor camps in agriculture, general industry, construction and logging). OSHA retains full authority over issues which are not subject to state enforcement under the plan. Thus, Federal OSHA retains its authority relative to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In accordance with Section 18(e), final approval relinquishes Federal OSHA authority with regard to occupational safety and health issues covered by the Oregon plan (with the exception of temporary labor camps in agriculture, general industry, construction and logging). OSHA retains full authority over issues which are not subject to state enforcement under the plan. Thus, Federal OSHA retains its authority relative to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Standards in the maritime issues covered by 29 CFR parts 1915, 1917, 1918, and 1919 (shipyards, marine terminals, longshoring, and gear certification), and enforcement of general industry and construction standards (29 CFR parts 1910 and 1926) appropriate to hazards found in these employments, which have been specifically excluded from coverage under the plan. This includes: Employment on the navigable waters of the U.S.; shipyard and boatyard employment on or immediately adjacent to the navigable waters--including floating vessels, dry docks, graving docks and marine railways--from the front gate of the work site to the U.S. statutory limits; longshoring,

marine terminal and marine grain terminal operations, except production or manufacturing areas and their storage facilities; construction activities emanating from or on floating vessels on the navigable waters of the U.S.; commercial diving originating from an object afloat a navigable waterway; and all other private sector places of employment on or adjacent to navigable waters whenever the activity occurs on or from the water;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Enforcement of occupational safety and health standards at all private sector establishments, including tribal and Indian-owned enterprises, on all Indian and non-Indian lands within the currently established boundaries of all Indian reservations, including the Warm Springs and Umatilla reservations, and on lands outside these reservations that are held in trust by the Federal government for these tribes. (Businesses owned by Indians or Indian tribes that conduct work activities outside the tribal reservation or trust lands are subject to the same jurisdiction as non-Indian owned businesses.);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Enforcement of occupational safety and health standards at worksites located within Federal military reservations, except private contractors working on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam construction projects, including reconstruction of docks or other appurtenances;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Enforcement of occupational safety and health standards with regard to employment at Crater Lake National Park;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Enforcement of occupational safety and health standards with regard to employment at the U.S. Department of Energy's Albany Research Center (ARC);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Enforcement of occupational safety and health standards with regard to all Federal government employers and employees; and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), including USPS employees, and contract employees and contractor-operated facilities engaged in USPS mail operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition, any hazard, industry, geographical area, operation or facility over which the state is unable to effectively exercise jurisdiction for reasons which OSHA determines are not related to the required performance or structure of the plan shall be deemed to be an issue not covered by the state plan which has received final approval, and shall be subject to Federal enforcement. Where enforcement jurisdiction is shared between Federal and state authorities for a particular area, project, or facility, in the interest of administrative practicability Federal jurisdiction may be assumed over the entire project or facility. In any of the aforementioned circumstances, Federal enforcement authority may be exercised after consultation with the state designated agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Federal authority under provisions of the Act not listed in Section 18(e) is unaffected by final approval of the Oregon State Plan. Thus, for example, the Assistant Secretary retains authority under Section 11(c) of the Act with regard to complaints alleging discrimination against employees because of the exercise of any right afforded to the employee by the Act, although such complaints may be referred to the state for investigation. The Assistant Secretary also retains authority under Section 6 of the Act to promulgate, modify or revoke occupational safety and health standards which address the working conditions of all employees, including those in states which have received an affirmative 18(e) determination, although such standards may not be federally applied. In the event that the state's 18(e) status is subsequently withdrawn and Federal authority reinstated, all Federal standards, including any standards promulgated or modified during the 18(e) period, would be federally enforceable in that state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As required by Section 18(f) of the Act, OSHA will continue to monitor the operations of the Oregon state program to assure that the provisions of the state plan are substantially complied with and that the program remains at least as effective as the Federal program. Failure by the state to comply with its obligations may result in the suspension or revocation of the final approval determination under Section 18(e), resumption of Federal

enforcement, and/or proceedings for withdrawal of plan approval.
