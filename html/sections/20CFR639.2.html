                                Sec. 639.2  What does WARN require?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">WARN requires employers who are planning a plant closing or a mass  layoff to give affected employees at least 60 days' notice of such an  employment action. While the 60-day period is the minimum for advance  notice, this provision is not intended to discourage employers from  voluntarily providing longer periods of advance notice. Not all plant  closings and layoffs are subject to the Act, and certain employment  thresholds must be reached before the Act applies. WARN sets out  specific exemptions, and provides for a reduction in the notification  period in particular circumstances. Damages and civil penalties can be  assessed against employers who violate the Act.</p>
