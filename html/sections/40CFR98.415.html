                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG  emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality- assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (e.g., if a meter  malfunctions), a substitute data value for the missing parameter shall  be used in the calculations, according to paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each missing value of the mass produced, fed into the  production process (for used material being reclaimed), fed into the  transformation process, fed into destruction devices, sent to another  facility for transformation, or sent to another facility for  destruction, the substitute value of that parameter shall be a secondary  mass measurement where such a measurement is available. For example, if  the mass produced is usually measured with a flowmeter at the inlet to  the day tank and that flowmeter fails to meet an accuracy or precision  test, malfunctions, or is rendered inoperable, then the mass produced  may be estimated by calculating the change in volume in the day tank and  multiplying it by the density of the product. Where a secondary mass  measurement is not available, the substitute value of the parameter  shall be an estimate based on a related parameter. For example, if a  flowmeter measuring the mass fed into a destruction device is rendered  inoperable, then the mass fed into the destruction device may be  estimated using the production rate and the previously observed  relationship between the production rate and the mass flow rate into the  destruction device.</p>
