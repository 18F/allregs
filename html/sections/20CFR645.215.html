under the ``general eligibility'' provisions of Sec.  645.212(a) or (b) or the ``other eligibles'' provisions of Sec.  645.213. The preference does not require that the category of noncustodial parents eligible under Sec.  645.212(c)(2)(i) must be exhausted before any other category of eligible noncustodial parents may be served. The operating entity may establish a process that gives preference to noncustodial parents eligible under Sec.  645.212(c)(2)(i) and that also provides WtW services to noncustodial parents eligible under the other provisions of Sec.  645.212(c)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In order to protect custodial parents and children who may be at risk of domestic violence, the operating entity must consult with domestic violence prevention and intervention organizations in the development of its WtW project serving noncustodial parents; and must not require the cooperation of the custodial parent as a condition of participation in the WtW program for either parent; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The operating entity must ensure that personal responsibility contracts:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Take into account the employment and child support status of the noncustodial parent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include all of the following parties:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The noncustodial parent,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The operating entity, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The agency responsible for administering the State Child Support Enforcement program as described under Title IV-D of the Act, unless the operating entity demonstrates to the Secretary of Labor with written documentation that it is not able to coordinate with the State IV-D agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Include the following elements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A commitment by the noncustodial parent to cooperate:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the establishment of paternity (if the participant is male) of the minor child at the earliest opportunity, through voluntary acknowledgment or other procedures, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the establishment of a child support order;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A commitment by the noncustodial parent to cooperate in the payment of child support for the minor child.
