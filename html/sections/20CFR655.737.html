                                Sec. 655.737  What are ``exempt'' H-1B nonimmigrants, and how does
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">of H-1B-dependent employers and willful violator employers?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An employer that is H-1B-dependent or a willful violator of the  H-1B program requirements (as described in Sec. 655.736) is subject to  the attestation obligations regarding displacement of U.S. workers and  recruitment of U.S. workers (as described in Sec. Sec. 655.738 and  655.739, respectively) for all LCAs that are filed during the time  period specified in Sec. 655.736(g). However, these additional  obligations do not apply to an LCA filed by such an employer if the LCA  is used only for the employment of ``exempt'' H-1B nonimmigrants  (through petitions and/or extensions of status) as described in this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> What is the test or standard for determining an H-1B  nonimmigrant's ``exempt'' status? An H-1B nonimmigrant is ``exempt'' for  purposes of this section if the nonimmigrant meets either of the two  following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Receives wages (including cash bonuses and similar compensation)  at an annual rate equal to at least $60,000; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Has attained a master's or higher degree (or its equivalent) in  a specialty related to the intended employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1))</em>, meaning that the compensation has readily  determinable market value, is readily convertible to cash tender, and is  actually received by the employee when due (which must be within the  year for which the employer seeks to count or credit the compensation  toward the employee's $60,000 earnings to qualify for exempt status).  Cash bonuses and similar compensation can be counted or credited toward  the $60,000 for ``exempt'' status only if payment is assured (i.e., if  the payment is contingent or conditional on some event such as the  employer's annual profits, the employer must guarantee payment even if  the contingency is not met). The full $60,000 annual wages or salary  must be received by the employee in order for the employee to have  ``exempt'' status. The wages or salary required for ``exempt'' status  cannot be decreased or pro rated based on the employee's part-time work  schedule; an H-1B nonimmigrant working part-time, whose actual annual  compensation is less than $60,000, would not qualify as exempt on the  basis of wages, even if the worker's earnings, if projected to a full- time work schedule, would theoretically exceed $60,000 in a year. Where  an employee works for less than a full year, the employee must receive  at least the appropriate pro rata share of the $60,000 in order to be  ``exempt'' (e.g., an employee who resigns after three months must be  paid at least $15,000). In the event of an investigation pursuant to  subpart I of this part, the Administrator will determine whether the  employee has received the required $60,000 per year, using the  employee's anniversary date to determine the one-year period; for an  employee who had worked for less than a full year (either at the  beginning of employment, or after his/   her last anniversary date), the determination as to the $60,000 annual  wages will be on a pro rata basis (i.e., whether the employee had been  paid at a rate of $60,000 per year (or $5,000 per month) including any  unpaid, guaranteed bonuses or similar compensation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> How is the ``master's or higher degree (or its equivalent) in a  specialty related to the intended employment'' to be determined? (1)  ``Master's or higher degree (or its equivalent),'' for purposes of this  section means a foreign academic degree from an institution which is  accredited or recognized under the law of the country where the degree  was obtained, and which is equivalent to a master's or higher degree  issued by a U.S. academic institution. The equivalence to a U.S.  academic degree cannot be established through experience or through  demonstration of expertise in the academic specialty (i.e., no ``time  equivalency'' or ``performance equivalency'' will be recognized as  substituting for a degree issued by an academic institution). The DHS  and the Department will consult appropriate sources of expertise in  making the determination of equivalency between foreign and U.S.  academic degrees. Upon the request of the DHS or the Department, the  employer shall provide evidence to establish that the H-1B nonimmigrant  has received the degree, that the degree was earned in the asserted  field of study, including an academic transcript of courses, and that  the institution from which the degree was obtained was accredited or  recognized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ``Specialty related to the intended employment,'' for purposes  of this section, means that the academic degree is in a specialty which  is generally accepted in the industry or occupation as an appropriate or  necessary credential or skill for the person who undertakes the  employment in question. A ``specialty'' which is not generally accepted  as appropriate or necessary to the employment would not be considered to  be sufficiently ``related' to afford the H-1B nonimmigrant status as an  ``exempt H-1B nonimmigrant.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> When and how is the determination of the H-1B nonimmigrant's  ``exempt'' status to be made? An employer that is H-1B-dependent or a  willful violator (as described in Sec. 655.736) may designate on the  LCA that the LCA will be used only to support H-1B petition(s) and/or  request(s) for extension of status for ``exempt'' H-1B nonimmigrants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the employer makes the designation of ``exempt'' H-1B  nonimmigrant(s) on the LCA, then the DHS--as part of the adjudication of  the H-1B petition or request for extension of status--will determine the  worker's ``exempt'' status, since an H-1B petition must be supported by  an LCA consistent with the petition (i.e., occupation, area of intended  employment, exempt status). The employer shall maintain, in the public  access file maintained in accordance with Sec. 755.760, a list of the  H-1B nonimmigrant(s) whose petition(s) and/or request(s) are supported  by LCA(s) which the employer has attested will be used only for exempt  H-1B nonimmigrants. In the event of an investigation under subpart I of  this part, the Administrator will give conclusive effect to an DHS  determination of ``exempt'' status based on the nonimmigrant's  educational attainments (i.e., master's or higher degree (or its  equivalent) in a specialty related to the intended employment) unless  the determination was based on false information. If the DHS  determination of ``exempt'' status was based on the assertion that the  nonimmigrant would receive wages (including cash bonuses and similar  compensation) at an annual rate equal to at least $60,000, the employer  shall provide evidence to show that such wages actually were received by  the nonimmigrant (consistent with paragraph (c) of this section and the  regulatory standards for satisfaction or payment of the required wages  as described in Sec. 655.731(c)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the employer makes the designation of ``exempt'' H-1B  nonimmigrants on the LCA, but is found in an enforcement action under  subpart I of this part to have used the LCA to employ nonimmigrants who  are, in fact, not exempt, then the employer will be subject to a finding  that it failed to comply with the nondisplacement and recruitment  obligations (as described in Sec. Sec. 655.738 and 655.739,  respectively) and may be assessed appropriate penalties and remedies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the employer does not make the designation of ``exempt'' H-1B  nonimmigrants on the LCA, then the employer has waived the option of not  being subject to the additional LCA attestation obligations on the basis  of employing only exempt H-1B nonimmigrants under the LCA. In the event  of an investigation under subpart I of this part, the Administrator will  not consider the question of the nonimmigrant(s)'s ``exempt'' status in  determining whether an H-1B-dependent employer or willful violator  employer has complied with such additional LCA attestation obligations.
