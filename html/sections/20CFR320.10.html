                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Request. A claimant shall have the right to request  reconsideration of an initial determination under Sec. 320.5 of this  part which denies in whole or in part his or her claim for benefits. A  claimant shall have the right to request reconsideration of a notice of  overpayment under Sec. 320.9 of this part. The base-year employer(s)  shall have the right to request reconsideration of an initial  determination under Sec. 320.5 of this part which awards in whole or in  part a claimant's claim for benefits. A reconsideration request shall be  made in writing and addressed to the adjudicating office that issued the  initial determination and must be received by the adjudicating office no  later than 60 days from the date of the notice of the initial decision.  A railroad employer may fulfill the written request requirement by using  an electronic system that has been approved by the agency in the manner  prescribed by the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review of evidence. Upon request, the party requesting  reconsideration shall have an opportunity to review all evidence and  documents that pertain to the initial determination. The Board shall  made all reasonable efforts to protect the identity of the source of  adverse evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of decision. The adjudicating office shall, as soon as  possible, render a decision on the request for reconsideration. If a  decision rendered by a district office, as the adjudicating office,  sustains the initial determination, either in whole or in part, the  decision shall be referred to the appropriate Field Service-Headquarters  staff for review prior to issuance. The party who requested  reconsideration shall be notified, in writing, of the decision on  reconsideration no later than 15 days from the date of the decision or,  where the Field Service-Headquarters staff has conducted a review of the  decision, within 7 days following the completion of the review. If the  decision results in denial of benefits, the claimant shall be notified  of the right to appeal as provided in Sec. 320.12 of this part. If the  decision results in payment of benefits, the base-year employer(s) shall  be notified of the right to appeal as provided in Sec. 320.12 of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Right to further review of initial determination. The right to  further review of a determination made under Sec. 320.5 or Sec. 320.9  of this part shall be forfeited unless a written request for  reconsideration is filed within the time period prescribed in this  section or good cause   is shown by the party requesting reconsideration for failing to file a  timely request for reconsideration. A railroad employer may fulfill the  written request requirement by using an electronic system approved by  the agency in the manner prescribed by the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Timely request for reconsideration. In determining whether  either the claimant or the base-year employer(s) has good cause for  failure to file a timely request for reconsideration, the adjudicating  office shall consider the circumstances which kept either the claimant  or the base-year employer(s) from filing the request on time and whether  any action by the Board misled either of them. Examples of circumstances  where good cause may exist include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A serious illness which prevented the claimant from contacting  the Board in person, in writing, or through a friend, relative or other  person;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A death or serious illness in the claimant's immediate family  which prevented him or her from filing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The destruction of important and relevant records;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A failure to be notified of a decision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The existence of an unusual or unavoidable circumstance which  demonstrates that either the claimant or the base-year employer(s) would  not have known of the need to file timely or which prevented either of  them from filing in a timely manner; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The claimant thought that his or her representative had  requested reconsideration.
