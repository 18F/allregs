                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In order for the National Marine Fisheries Service to consider  authorizing the taking by U.S. citizens of small numbers of marine  mammals incidental to a specified activity (other than commercial  fishing), or to make a finding that an incidental take is unlikely to  occur, a written request must be submitted to the Assistant  Administrator. All requests must include the following information for  their activity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A detailed description of the specific activity or class of  activities that can be expected to result in incidental taking of marine  mammals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date(s) and duration of such activity and the specific  geographical region where it will occur;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The species and numbers of marine mammals likely to be found  within the activity area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the status, distribution, and seasonal  distribution (when applicable) of the affected species or stocks of  marine mammals likely to be affected by such activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The type of incidental taking authorization that is being  requested (i.e., takes by harassment only; takes by harassment, injury  and/or death) and the method of incidental taking;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> By age, sex, and reproductive condition (if possible), the  number of marine mammals (by species) that may be taken by each type of  taking identified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, and the number of  times such takings by each type of taking are likely to occur;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The anticipated impact of the activity upon the species or stock  of marine mammal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The anticipated impact of the activity on the availability of  the species or stocks of marine mammals for subsistence uses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The anticipated impact of the activity upon the habitat of the  marine mammal populations, and the likelihood of restoration of the  affected habitat;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The anticipated impact of the loss or modification of the  habitat on the marine mammal populations involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The availability and feasibility (economic and technological)  of equipment, methods, and manner of conducting such activity or other  means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact upon the  affected species or stocks, their habitat, and on their availability for  subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating  grounds, and areas of similar significance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Where the proposed activity would take place in or near a  traditional Arctic subsistence hunting area and/or may affect the  availability of a species or stock of marine mammal for Arctic  subsistence uses, the applicant must submit either a plan of cooperation  or information that identifies what measures have been taken and/or will  be taken to minimize any adverse effects on the availability of marine  mammals for subsistence uses. A plan must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement that the applicant has notified and provided the  affected subsistence community with a draft plan of cooperation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A schedule for meeting with the affected subsistence  communities to discuss proposed activities and to resolve potential  conflicts regarding any aspects of either the operation or the plan of  cooperation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A description of what measures the applicant has taken and/or  will take to ensure that proposed activities will not interfere with  subsistence whaling or sealing; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> What plans the applicant has to continue to meet with the  affected communities, both prior to and while conducting the activity,  to resolve conflicts and to notify the communities of any changes in the  operation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> The suggested means of accomplishing the necessary monitoring  and reporting that will result in increased knowledge of the species,  the level of taking or impacts on populations of marine mammals that are  expected to be present while conducting activities and suggested means  of minimizing burdens by coordinating such reporting requirements with  other schemes already applicable to persons conducting such activity.  Monitoring plans should include a description of the survey techniques  that would be used to determine the movement and activity of marine  mammals near the activity site(s) including migration and other habitat  uses, such as feeding. Guidelines for developing a site-specific  monitoring plan may be obtained by writing to the Director, Office of  Protected Resources; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Suggested means of learning of, encouraging, and coordinating  research opportunities, plans, and activities relating to reducing such  incidental taking and evaluating its effects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Assistant Administrator shall determine the adequacy and  completeness of a request and, if determined to be adequate and  complete, will begin the public review process by publishing in the  Federal Register either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A proposed incidental harassment authorization; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A notice of receipt of a request for the implementation or  reimplementation of regulations governing the incidental taking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Through notice in the Federal Register, newspapers of general  circulation, and appropriate electronic media in the coastal areas that  may be affected by such activity, NMFS will invite information,  suggestions, and comments for a period not to exceed 30 days from the  date of publication in the Federal Register. All information and  suggestions will be considered by the National Marine Fisheries Service  in developing, if appropriate, the most effective regulations governing  the issuance of letters of authorization or conditions governing the  issuance of an incidental harassment authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applications that are determined to be incomplete or  inappropriate for the type of taking requested, will be returned to the  applicant with an explanation of why the application is being returned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Assistant Administrator shall evaluate each request to  determine, based upon the best available scientific evidence, whether  the taking by the specified activity within the specified geographic  region will have a negligible impact on the species or stock and, where  appropriate, will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the  availability of such species or stock for subsistence uses. If the  Assistant Administrator finds that the mitigating measures would render  the impact of the specified activity negligible when it would not  otherwise satisfy that requirement, the Assistant Administrator may make  a finding of negligible impact subject to such mitigating measures being  successfully implemented. Any preliminary findings of ``negligible  impact'' and ``no unmitigable adverse impact'' shall be proposed for  public comment along with either the proposed incidental harassment  authorization or the proposed regulations for the specific activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If, subsequent to the public review period, the Assistant  Administrator finds that the taking by the specified activity would have  more than a negligible impact on the species or stock of marine mammal  or would have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such  species or stock for subsistence uses, the Assistant Administrator shall  publish in the Federal Register the negative finding along with the  basis for denying the request.</p>
