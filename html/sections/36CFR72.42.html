The  preapplication narrative must describe the extent of increased personnel  and maintenance for the project(s) included in the proposal, if any, and  methods of financing them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The expansion must increase the extent, volume, scope, or  quality of recreation opportunities to residents of distressed  neighborhoods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New development. For purposes of this program, new development  is defined as the developing for changing of relatively unimproved  property which has not previously been developed for recreation. This  includes the creation of new parks and facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rehabilitation.
