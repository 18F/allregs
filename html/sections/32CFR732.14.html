                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Medical. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consultation and treatment provided by physicians  or at medical facilities, and procedures not involving treatment when  directed by COMNAVMEDCOM, are authorized. Such care includes, but is not  limited to: treatment by physicians, hospital inpatient and outpatient  care, surgery, nursing, medicine, laboratory and x-ray services,  physical therapy, eye examinations, etc. See Sec. 732.17 for prior  approval of these services in nonemergency situations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When transplant (including bone-marrow) is the treatment of  choice, COMNAVMEDCOM approval is required. If time permits, telephone  (A) 294-1102, (C) (202) 653-1102 during regular hours or (A) 294-1327,  (C) 653-1327 after regular duty hours, and followup with a message.  Request approval via message in nonemergency situations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maternity episode. If a member authorized care under this part  qualifies for care under the provisions of Sec. 732.17(c) and delivers  in a civilian hospital, routine newborn care (i.e., nursery, newborn  examination, PKU test, etc.) is a part of the mother's admission  expenses. Regardless of circumstances necessitating delivery in a  civilian facility or how charges are separated on the bill, charges will  be paid from funds available for care of the mother. If the infant  becomes a patient in his or her own right--through an extension of the  birthing hospital stay because of complications, transfer to another  facility, or subsequent admission--the provisions of part 728 of this  chapter and NAVMEDCOMINST 6320.18 are applicable, and the sponsor  becomes responsible for a part of the medical expenses incurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dental. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With prior approval, the following may be provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All types of treatment (including operative, restorative, and  oral surgical) to relieve pain and abort infection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prosthetic treatment to restore extensive loss of masticatory  function or the replacement of anterior teeth for esthetic reasons.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Repair of existing dental prostheses when neglect of the  repair would result in unserviceability of the appliance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any type of treatment adjunctive to medical or surgical care.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> All x-rays, drugs, etc., required for treatment or care in  paragraphs (c)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In emergencies (no prior approval), only measures appropriate to  relieve pain or abort infection are authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Eye refractions and spectacles. Includes refractions of eyes by  physicians and optometrists and furnishing and repairing spectacles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Refractions. A refraction may be obtained from a civilian source  at Government expense only when Federal facilities are not available, no  suitable prescription is in the member's Health Record, and the  cognizant OMA or referring USMTF has given prior approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Spectacles. When a member has no suitable spectacles and the  lack thereof, combined with the delay in obtaining suitable ones from a  Federal source would prevent performance of duty; repair, replacement,  or procurement from a civilian source may be authorized upon initiation  of an after-the-fact request per Sec. 732.17. Otherwise, the  prescription from the refractionist, with proper facial measurements,  must be sent for fabrication to the appropriate dispensing activity set  forth in NAVMED COMINST 6810.1. See Sec. 732.15(g) concerning contact  lenses.</p>
