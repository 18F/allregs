                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> does not apply in the case of an  adjustable rate mortgage being refinanced with a fixed rate loan.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703, 3712)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For loans bearing an interest rate agreed upon by the veteran  and the lender, the veteran may pay reasonable discount points in  connection with the loan. The discount points may not be included in the  loan amount, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans under  38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F).   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703, 3712)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The rate of interest in instruments securing the indebtedness  for all loans may be expressed in terms of add-on or discount.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3710, 3712)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interest in excess of the rate reported by the lender when  requesting evidence of guaranty or insurance shall not be payable on any  advance, or in the event of any delinquency or default; Provided, that a  late charge not in excess of an amount equal to 4 percent of any  installment paid more than 15 days after due date shall not be  considered a violation of this limitation.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3712)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Adjustable rate mortgage loans which comply with the  requirements of this paragraph are eligible for guaranty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interest rate index. Changes in the interest rate charged on an  adjustable rate mortgage must correspond to changes in the weekly  average yield on one year (52 week) Treasury bills adjusted to a  constant maturity. Yields on one year Treasury bills at ``constant  maturity'' are interpolated by the United States Treasury from the daily  yield curve. This curve, which relates the yield on the security to its  time to   maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded  one year Treasury bills in the over-the-counter market. The weekly  average one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are published by  the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal  Reserve Statistical Release Report H.15 (519) is released each Monday.  These one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are also published  monthly in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, published by the Federal  Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System, as well as quarterly in the  Treasury Bulletin, published by the Department of the Treasury.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Frequency of interest rate changes. Interest rate adjustments  must occur on an annual basis, except that the first adjustment may  occur not sooner than 12 months nor later than 18 months from the date  of the borrower's first mortgage payment. The adjusted rate will become  effective the first day of the month following the adjustment date; the  first monthly payment at the new rate will be due on the first day of  the following month. To set the new interest rate, the lender will  determine the change between the initial (i.e., base) index figure and  the current index figure. The initial index figure shall be the most  recent figure available before the date of mortgage loan origination.  The current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available  30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Method of rate changes. Interest rate changes may only be  implemented through adjustments to the borrower's monthly payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Initial rate and magnitude of changes. The initial contract  interest rate of an adjustable rate mortgage shall be agreed upon by the  lender and the veteran. The rate must be reflective of adjustable rate  lending. Annual adjustments in the interest rate shall be set at a  certain spread or margin over the interest rate index prescribed in  paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Except for the initial rate, this  margin shall remain constant over the life of the loan. Annual  adjustments to the contract interest rate shall correspond to annual  changes in the interest rate index, subject to the following conditions  and limitations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No single adjustment to the interest rate may result in a change  in either direction of more than one percentage point from the interest  rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment.  Index changes in excess of one percentage point may not be carried over  for inclusion in an adjustment in a subsequent year. Adjustments in the  effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not  result in a change in either direction of more than five percentage  points from the initial contract interest rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At each adjustment date, changes in the index interest rate,  whether increases or decreases, must be translated into the adjusted  mortgage interest rate, rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one  percent, up or down. For example, if the margin is 2 percent and the new  index figure is 6.06 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will  be 8 percent. If the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is  6.07 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8\1/8\  percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Pre-loan disclosure. The lender shall explain fully and in  writing to the borrower, no later than on the date upon which the lender  provides the prospective borrower with a loan application, the nature of  the obligation taken. The borrower shall certify in writing that he or  she fully understands the obligation and a copy of the signed  certification shall be placed in the loan folder and included in the  loan submission to VA. Such lender disclosure must include the following  items:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fact that the mortgage interest rate may change, and an  explanation of how changes correspond to changes in the interest rate  index;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identification of the interest rate index, its source of  publication and availability;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The frequency (i.e., annually) with which interest rate levels  and monthly payments will be adjusted, and the length of the interval  that will precede the initial adjustment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A hypothetical monthly payment schedule that displays the  maximum potential increases in monthly payments to the borrower over the  first   five years of the mortgage, subject to the provisions of the mortgage  instrument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Annual disclosure. At least 25 days before any adjustment to a  borrower's monthly payment may occur, the lender must provide a notice  to the borrower which sets forth the date of the notice, the effective  date of the change, the old interest rate, the new interest rate, the  new monthly payment amount, the current index and the date it was  published, and a description of how the payment adjustment was  calculated. A copy of the annual disclosure shall be made a part of the  lender's permanent record on the loan.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3707, 3712)  [60 FR 38257, July 26, 1995]</p>
