However, BLM may make case-by-case exceptions in determining the population served at a particular site by uses not located within the same facility and not authorized under the same grant or lease. BLM has the sole responsibility to make this determination. For example, when a site has a mix of high-power and low-power uses that are authorized by separate grants or leases, and only the high-power uses are capable of serving an RMA or community with the greatest population, BLM may separately determine the population strata served by the low-power uses (if not collocated in the same facility with the high-power uses), and calculate their rent as described in Sec. 2806.30 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> BLM considers all facilities (and all uses within the same facility) located at one site to serve the same RMA or community.
