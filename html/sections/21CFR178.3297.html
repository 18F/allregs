For the  purpose of this section, the term ``colorant'' includes substances such  as optical brighteners and fluorescent whiteners, which may not  themselves be colored, but whose use is intended to affect the color of  a food-contact material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The colorant must be used in accordance with current good  manufacturing practice, including use levels which are not in excess of  those reasonably required to accomplish the intended coloring effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Colorants in this section must conform to the description and  specifications indicated. If a polymer described in this section is  itself the subject of a regulation promulgated under section 409 of the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, it shall also comply with any  specifications and limitations prescribed by that regulation. Extraction  testing guidelines to conduct studies for additional uses of colorants  under this section are available from the Food and Drug Administration  free of charge from the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food  Safety and Applied Nutrition, 5100 Paint Branch Pkwy., College Park, MD  20740, 240-402-1200</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Color additives and their lakes listed for direct use in foods,  under the provisions of the color additive regulations in parts 73, 74,  81, and 82 of this chapter, may also be used as colorants for food- contact polymers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> List of substances:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Substances                          Limitations ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminum...............................
