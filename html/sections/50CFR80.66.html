Agencies must use the National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-associated Recreation or another statistically reliable survey or technique approved by the Regional Director for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If an agency uses statistical sampling to determine the relative distribution of resident anglers in the State between those that fish in marine environments and those that fish in freshwater environments, the sampling must be complete by the earlier of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Five years after the last statistical sample; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before completing the first certification following any change in the licensing system that could affect the number of sportfishing license holders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The amounts allocated from each year's apportionment do not necessarily have to result in an equitable allocation for each year.
