                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Insurance disclosures. In connection with the initial purchase  of an insurance product or annuity by a consumer from you, you must  disclose to the consumer, except to the extent the disclosure would not  be accurate, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The insurance product or annuity is not a deposit or other  obligation of, or guaranteed by, a State savings association or an  affiliate of a State savings association;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The insurance product or annuity is not insured by the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other agency of the United  States, a State savings association, or (if applicable) an affiliate of  a State savings association; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of an insurance product or annuity that involves an  investment risk, there is investment risk associated with the product,  including the possible loss of value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Credit disclosures. In the case of an application for credit in  connection with which an insurance product or annuity is solicited,  offered, or sold, you must disclose that a State savings association may  not condition an extension of credit on either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The consumer's purchase of an insurance product or annuity from  the State savings association or any of its affiliates; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The consumer's agreement not to obtain, or a prohibition on the  consumer from obtaining, an insurance product or annuity from an  unaffiliated entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timing and method of disclosures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  disclosures required by paragraph (a) of this section must be provided  orally and in writing before the completion of the initial sale of an  insurance product or annuity to a consumer. The disclosure required by  paragraph (b) of this section must be made orally and in writing at the  time the consumer applies for an extension of credit in connection with  which an insurance product or annuity is solicited, offered, or sold.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception for transactions by mail. If you conduct an insurance  product or annuity sale by mail, you are not required to make the oral  disclosures required by paragraph (a) of this section. If you take an  application for credit by mail, you are not required to make the oral  disclosure required by paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception for transactions by telephone. If a sale of an  insurance product or annuity is conducted by telephone, you may provide  the written disclosures required by paragraph (a) of this section by  mail within 3 business days beginning on the first business day after  the sale, solicitation, or offer, excluding Sundays and the legal public  holidays specified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a). If you take an application for  credit by telephone, you may provide the written disclosure required by  paragraph (b) of this section by mail, provided you mail it to the  consumer within three days beginning the first business day after the  application is taken, excluding Sundays and the legal public holidays  specified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Electronic form of disclosures. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subject to the requirements  of section 101(c) of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National  Commerce Act (12 U.S.C. 7001(c)), you may provide the written  disclosures required by paragraph (a) and (b) of this section through  electronic media instead of on paper, if the consumer affirmatively  consents to receiving the disclosures electronically and if the  disclosures are provided in a format that the consumer may retain or  obtain later, for example, by printing or storing electronically (such  as by downloading).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You are not required to provide orally any disclosures required  by paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section that you provide by electronic  media.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Disclosures must be readily understandable. The disclosures  provided shall be conspicuous, simple, direct, readily understandable,  and designed to call attention to the nature and significance of the  information provided. For instance, you may use the following  disclosures in visual media, such as television broadcasting, ATM  screens, billboards, signs, posters and written advertisements and  promotional materials, as appropriate and consistent with paragraphs (a)  and (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"> NOT A DEPOSIT</p><p class="depth3"> NOT FDIC-INSURED</p><p class="depth3"> NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY</p><p class="depth3"> NOT GUARANTEED BY THE STATE SAVINGS ASSOCIATION</p><p class="depth3"> MAY GO DOWN IN VALUE</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Disclosures must be meaningful. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must provide the  disclosures required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section in a  meaningful form. Examples of the types of methods that could call  attention to the nature and significance of the information provided  include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A plain-language heading to call attention to the disclosures;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A typeface and type size that are easy to read;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Wide margins and ample line spacing;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Boldface or italics for key words; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Distinctive type size, style, and graphic devices, such as  shading or sidebars, when the disclosures are combined with other  information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You have not provided the disclosures in a meaningful form if  you merely state to the consumer that the required disclosures are  available in printed material, but do not provide the printed material  when required and do not orally disclose the information to the consumer  when required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to those disclosures made through electronic  media for which paper or oral disclosures are not required, the  disclosures are not meaningfully provided if the consumer may bypass the  visual text of the disclosures before purchasing an insurance product or  annuity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Consumer acknowledgment. You must obtain from the consumer, at  the time a consumer receives the disclosures required under paragraphs  (a) or (b) of this section, or at the time of the initial purchase by  the consumer of an insurance product or annuity, a written  acknowledgment by the consumer that the consumer received the  disclosures. You may permit a consumer to acknowledge receipt of the  disclosures electronically or in paper form. If the disclosures required  under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section are provided in connection  with a transaction that is conducted by telephone, you must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Obtain an oral acknowledgment of receipt of the disclosures and  maintain sufficient documentation to show that the acknowledgment was  given; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Make reasonable efforts to obtain a written acknowledgment from  the consumer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Advertisements and other promotional material for insurance  products or annuities. The disclosures described in paragraph (a) of  this section are required in advertisements and promotional material for  insurance products or annuities unless the advertisements and  promotional material are of a general nature describing or listing the  services or products offered by a State savings association.</p>
