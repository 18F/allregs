                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. If an awardee has failed to materially comply with the  terms and conditions of the award, OAO may take certain enforcement  actions, including, but not limited to, suspending the award pending  corrective action and terminating the award for cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Suspension. OAO generally will suspend (rather than immediately  terminate) an award to allow the awardee an opportunity to take  appropriate corrective action before OAO makes a termination decision.  OAO may decide to terminate the award if the awardee does not take  appropriate corrective action during the period of suspension. OAO may  terminate, without first suspending, the award if the deficiency is so  serious as to warrant immediate termination. Termination for cause may  be appealed under the terms and conditions identified in the OAO award  agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination. An award also may be terminated, partially or  wholly, by the awardee or by OAO with the consent of the awardee. If the  awardee decides to terminate a portion of the award, OAO may determine  that the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes  for which the award was originally made. In any such case, OAO will  advise the awardee of the possibility of termination of the entire award  and allow the awardee to withdraw its termination request. If the  awardee does not withdraw its request for partial termination, OAO may  initiate procedures to terminate the entire award for cause.</p>
