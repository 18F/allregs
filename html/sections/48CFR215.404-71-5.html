                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This special factor provides an incentive for contractors to  reduce costs. To the extent that the contractor can demonstrate cost  reduction efforts that benefit the pending contract, the contracting  officer may increase the prenegotiation profit objective by an amount  not to exceed 4 percent of total objective cost (Block 20 of the DD Form  1547) to recognize these efforts (Block 29).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To determine if using this factor is appropriate, the  contracting officer shall consider criteria, such as the following, to  evaluate the benefit the contractor's cost reduction efforts will have  on the pending contract:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contractor's participation in Single Process Initiative  improvements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Actual cost reductions achieved on prior contracts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reduction or elimination of excess or idle facilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The contractor's cost reduction initiatives (e.g., competition  advocacy programs, technical insertion programs, obsolete parts control  programs, spare parts pricing reform, value engineering, outsourcing of  functions such as information technology). Metrics developed by the  contractor   such as fully loaded labor hours (i.e., cost per labor hour, including  all direct and indirect costs) or other productivity measures may  provide the basis for assessing the effectiveness of the contractor's  cost reduction initiatives over time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The contractor's adoption of process improvements to reduce  costs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Subcontractor cost reduction efforts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The contractor's effective incorporation of commercial items and  processes; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The contractor's investment in new facilities when such  investments contribute to better asset utilization or improved  productivity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When selecting the percentage to use for this special factor,  the contracting officer has maximum flexibility in determining the best  way to evaluate the benefit the contractor's cost reduction efforts will  have on the pending contract. However, the contracting officer shall  consider the impact that quantity differences, learning, changes in  scope, and economic factors such as inflation and deflation will have on  cost reduction.
