                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Modifications to general procedures. Subpart 159.005 of this chapter contains the approval procedures. Those procedures must be followed, except as modified in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Preapproval review under Sec. Sec. 159.005-5 and 159.005-7 may be omitted if a similar design has already been approved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information required under Sec. 159.005-5(a)(2) (i) through (iii) of this chapter must be included in the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The application must also include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Type of performance (i.e. Type I or Type V) that the lifejacket is designed to provide.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any special purpose(s) for which the lifejacket is designed and the vessel(s) or vessel type(s) on which its use is planned.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Buoyancy and torque values along with tolerances to be allowed in production. The Coast Guard normally will approve tolerances of up to 10% unless prototypes are tested at greater extremes or greater tolerances are otherwise justified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The text of any optional marking to be provided in addition to required text.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The service manual and written guidelines required by Sec.

Copies of the letter are also provided for each facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An approval will be suspended or terminated under Sec. 159.005-15 of this chapter if the manufacturer fails to maintain approved servicing facilities that meet Sec. 160.176-19 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Manuals and guidelines. The manuals and servicing facility guidelines required by this subpart are reviewed with the application for lifejacket approval. Changes will be required if needed to comply with Sec. Sec. 160.176-19 and 160.176-21 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Approval of servicing facilities. (1) Approval of servicing facilities initially proposed for use is considered during and as a part of the lifejacket approval process described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approval of servicing facilities initially proposed for use is considered during and as a part of the lifejacket approval process described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other servicing facilities may subsequently be considered for approval, upon submission of a letter of application to Commandant containing each of the applicable items required of manufacturers and laboratories under Sec. 159.005-5 of this chapter and the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A copy of guidelines meeting Sec. 160.176-19(d) of this part, if different from those originally approved with the lifejacket;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A list of the sources the servicing facility proposes to use for parts and manuals for the servicing of the make and model of lifejacket applied for; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A report of inspection prepared by an independent laboratory which includes the time, date, and place of the inspection, the name of the inspector, and observations that show whether the facility meets Sec.

A lifejacket that does not meet requirements in this subpart may still be approved if the device--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meets other requirements prescribed by the Commandant in place of or in addition to requirements in this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provides at least the same degree of safety provided by other lifejackets that do comply with this subpart.
