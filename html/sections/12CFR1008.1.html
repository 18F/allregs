This part, known as Regulation H, is issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to implement the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, title V of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (S.A.F.E. Act) (Pub. L. 110-289, 122 Stat. 2654, 12 U.S.C. 5101 et seq.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this part is to enhance consumer protection and reduce fraud by directing states to adopt minimum uniform standards for the licensing and registration of residential mortgage loan originators and to participate in a nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry database of residential mortgage loan originators. Under the S.A.F.E. Act, if the Bureau determines that a state's loan origination licensing system does not meet the minimum requirements of the S.A.F.E. Act, the Bureau is charged with establishing and implementing a system for all loan originators in that state. Additionally, if at any time the Bureau determines that the nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry is failing to meet the S.A.F.E. Act's requirements, the Bureau is charged with establishing and maintaining a licensing and registry database for loan originators.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Organization. The regulation is divided into subparts and appendices as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subpart A establishes the definitions applicable to this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subpart B provides the minimum standards that a state must meet in licensing loan originators, including

standards for whom a state must require to be licensed, and sets forth the Bureau's procedure for determining a state's compliance with the minimum standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subpart C provides the requirements that the Bureau will apply in any state that the Bureau determines has not established a licensing and registration system in compliance with the minimum standards of the S.A.F.E. Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subpart D provides minimum requirements for the administration of the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Subpart E clarifies the Bureau's enforcement authority in states in which it operates a state licensing system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Appendices A through D set forth examples to aid in the understanding and application of the regulations.</p>
