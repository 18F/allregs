                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Incoming. Except as provided in this paragraph, each handler  shall cause to be determined, through the inspection agency, and at  handler expense, the percent of inedible kernels in each variety  received by him and shall report the determination to the Board. The  quantity of inedible kernels in each variety in excess of two percent of  the kernel weight received, shall constitute a weight obligation to be  accumulated in the course of processing and shall be delivered to the  Board, or Board accepted crushers, feed manufacturers, or feeders. The  Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may change this percentage  for any crop year, may authorize additional outlets, may exempt  bleaching stock from inedible kernel determination or obligation and may  establish rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the  administration of this provision, including the method of determining  inedible kernel content and satisfaction of the disposition obligation.  The Board for good cause may waive portions of obligations for those  handlers not generating inedible material from such sources as blanching  or manufacturing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Outgoing. For any crop year the Board may establish, with the  approval of the Secretary, such minimum quality and inspection  requirements applicable to almonds to be handled or to be processed into  manufactured products, as will contribute to orderly marketing or be in  the public interest. In such crop year, no handler shall handle or  process almonds into manufactured items or products unless they meet the  applicable requirements as evidenced by certification acceptable to the  Board. The Board may, with the approval of the Secretary, establish  different outgoing quality requirements for different markets. The  Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish rules and  regulations necessary   and incidental to the administration of this provision.
