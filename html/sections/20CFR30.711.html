other evidence. Where no code is supplied, OWCP may determine the code based on the narrative description of the procedure on the billing form and in associated medical reports. OWCP will pay no more than the maximum allowable fee for that procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the charge submitted for a service supplied to an employee exceeds the maximum amount determined to be reasonable according to the schedule, OWCP shall pay the amount allowed by the schedule for that service and shall notify the provider in writing that payment was reduced for that service in accordance with the schedule. OWCP shall also notify the provider of the method for requesting reconsideration of the balance of the charge. The decision of OWCP to pay less than the charged amount is final when issued and is not subject to the adjudicatory process described in subpart D of this part.</p>
