                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General prohibitions. In addition to the applicable license requirements for national security, regional stability, anti-terrorism and United Nations embargo reasons in Sec. Sec. 742.4, 742.6, 742.8, 746.3 and 746.8 of the EAR, a license is required to export or reexport to any destination other than Canada cameras described in ECCNs 6A003.b.3, 6A003.b.4.b, or 6A003.b.4.c if at the time of export or reexport, the exporter or reexporter knows or is informed that the item will be or is intended to be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Used by a ``military end-user,'' as defined in paragraph (d) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Incorporated into a ``military commodity'' controlled by ECCN 0A919.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional prohibition on exporters or reexporters informed by BIS. BIS may inform an exporter or reexporter, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for the export or reexport of items described in ECCNs 6A003.b.3, 6A003.b.4.b, or 6A003.b.4.c to specified end-users, because BIS has determined that there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to the users or unauthorized incorporation into the ``military commodities'' described in paragraph (a) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> License review standard. Applications for licenses required by this section will be reviewed by applying the policies that would be applied under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR Parts 120-130).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Military end-user. In this section, the term ``military end-user'' means the national armed services (army, navy, marine, air force, or coast guard), as well as the national guard and national police, government intelligence or reconnaissance organizations, or any person or entity whose actions or functions are intended to support ``military end-uses'' as defined in Sec. 744.17(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exception. Shipments subject to the prohibitions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section that are consigned to and for the official use of the U.S. Government authorized pursuant to Sec. 740.11(b)(2)(ii) of the EAR may be made under License Exception GOV. No other license exceptions apply to the prohibitions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
