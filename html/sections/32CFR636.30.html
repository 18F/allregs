                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Drivers will not stop, park, or leave standing their vehicle,  whether attended or unattended, upon the roadway when it is possible to  stop, park or leave their vehicle off the roadway. In any case, parking  or standing the vehicle upon the roadway will only be done in an  emergency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vehicles, not clearly identified as operated by a handicapped  individual, will not be parked in a handicapped parking space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever Military Police find a vehicle parked or stopped in  violation of this section, they may immediately move, or cause to be  moved, the vehicle off the roadway. At the direction of the Provost  Marshall, or his designee, vehicles parked in restricted or reserved  parking spaces, may be moved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Military Police may remove or cause to be removed, to a safe  place, any unattended vehicle illegally left standing upon any highway  or bridge or within 10 feet of any railroad track on the installation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> As a crime prevention measure, the Military Police may pick up  keys left in vehicles, secure the vehicle in place, and post a notice  directing the owner to proceed to the MP station to claim his/her keys.  The program will be adequately publicized and will only be invoked after  a conscientious attempt to locate the owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No driver will stop, stand, or park a vehicle:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On the roadway side of any vehicle stopped or parked at the edge  of a curb or a street.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On a sidewalk.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within an intersection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> On a crosswalk.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Alongside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction when  traffic would be obstructed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Upon a bridge or other elevated structure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> On any railroad tracks or within 10 feet of any rail road track.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> On any controlled-access highway.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Where prohibited by official signs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Alongside any roadway in any manner which obstructs traffic.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> No driver will stand or park a vehicle, whether occupied or not,  except momentarily to pick up or discharge a passenger or passengers:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In front of a public or private driveway.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 10 feet of a fire hydrant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 20 feet upon the approach to any flashing signal, a stop  sign, yield sign, or traffic control signal located at the side of a  roadway.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Within 20 feet of a driveway entrance to any fire station and on  the side of a street opposite the entrance to any fire station within 75  feet of said entrance (when properly sign posted).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> At any place where official signs prohibit standing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Adjacent to any curb painted yellow or identified, by signs, as  a ``No Parking'' area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Along a roadway against the flow of traffic.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Within 20 feet of any building in what would reasonably be  considered a ``fire-lane'' unless specified as a parking space.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Parallel parking along the curb is authorized in housing areas  unless otherwise posted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Parking is prohibited upon lawns or grassed (seeded) areas,  unless specifically authorized by the Provost Marshal. This prohibition  is not intended, however, to extend to those locations designated as  bivouac sites, range areas, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> No dual-wheeled or tandem-wheeled recreational vehicles and  trailers will be stored at government quarters. All other recreational  vehicles, to include campers, trailers, boats, pop-up campers, and  camper shells may be parked in the driveway area or under the carport of  individual quarters. To prevent injury to children playing on and around  trailers, one tire on each side of the trailer will be chocked in front  and back. Trailer tongues, without installed supports, will either be  left on the ground or supported in such a manner as to preclude the  support tipping over and allowing the trailer tongue to fall. If the  vehicle creates a safety hazard or is an eyesore, personnel are  encouraged to use the storage facilities available at the Outdoor  Recreation Center, Holbrook Pond, Fort Stewart, or at the Private  Vehicle Storage area at Hunter Army Airfield. House trailers are not  authorized to be parked in the quarters area. Campers, camper trailers,  and tents will not be approved for occupancy in the quarters area.  Parking of recreational vehicles on the street will be limited to 24  hours for owners to load and unload the vehicle at the owner's quarters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> No driver will use a parking lot, sidewalk, fire lane, or vacant  property to drive on in order to avoid a traffic control device or alter  the traffic flow plan unless authorized to do so by the Military Police  or a traffic control device.</p>
