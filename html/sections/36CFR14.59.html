                                Sec. 14.59  Additional rights-of-way within highway rights-of-way.

                            <p class="depth0">A right-of-way granted under this subpart confers upon the grantee the right to use the lands within the right-of-way for highway purposes only. Separate application must be made under pertinent statutes and regulations in order to obtain authorization to use the lands within such rights-of-way for other purposes. Additional rights-of-way will be subject to the highway rights-of-way. Future relocation or change of the additional right-of-way made necessary by the highway use will be accomplished at the expense of the additional right-of-way grantee. Prior to the granting of an additional right-of-way the applicant therefor will submit to the authorized officer a written statement from the highway right-of-way grantee indicating any objections it may have thereto, and such stipulations as it considers desirable for the additional right-of-way.</p>
