Licenses require the property to be held by the State in accounts which are identified as blocked under the regulations. A separate index of these blocked assets is required to be maintained by the State agency. The requirements of this section for identification and separate indexing of blocked assets apply to all blocked assets held by State agencies and any licenses issued prior to the effective date of this section hereby are amended by the incorporation of such requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To be eligible for a specific license under this section, the state agency must demonstrate that it has the statutory authority under appropriate state law to comply with the requirements of Sec. 515.205. Such a showing shall include an opinion of the State Attorney General that such statutory authority exists.
