                                Sec. 134.23  Containers or holders designed for or capable of reuse.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Usual and ordinary reusable containers or holders. Except for  goods of a NAFTA country which are usual containers, containers or  holders designed for or capable of reuse after the contents have been  consumed, whether imported full or empty, must be individually marked to  indicate the country of their own origin with a marking such as,  ``Container Made in (name of country).'' Examples of the containers or  holders contemplated are heavy duty steel drums, tanks, and other  similar shipping, storage, transportation containers or holders capable  of reuse. These containers or holders are subject to the treatment  specified in General Rule of Interpretation 5(b), Harmonized Tariff  Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other reusable containers or holders. Containers or holders  which give the whole importation its essential character, as described  in General Rule of Interpretation 5(a) (19 U.S.C. 1202), must be  individually marked to clearly indicate their own origin with a marking  such as, ``Container made in (name of country).'' Examples of the  containers contemplated are mustard jars reusable as beer mugs; shaving  soap containers reusable as shaving mugs; fancy cologne bottles reusable  as flower vases, and other containers which have a lasting value or  decorative use.
