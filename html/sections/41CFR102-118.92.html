                            <p class="depth0">Your agency must ensure that its employees keep the original  receipts for transportation purchases over $75.00 made with cash. If it  is impractical to furnish receipts in any instance as required by this  subtitle, the failure to do so must be fully explained on the travel  voucher. Mere inconvenience in the matter of taking receipts will not be  considered. These receipts must be saved for a possible postpayment  audit by the GSA Audit Division. If your agency requires the filing of  paper receipts, then you must do so. For transportation purchases over  $75.00, your agency must ensure that copies of all original papers are  retained at your agency. Copies of tickets from a TSP must be sent to-- General Services Administration, Transportation Audit Division (QMCA),  Crystal Plaza 4, Room 300, 2200 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202,  www.gsa.gov/transaudits.
