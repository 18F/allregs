If a manufacturer wishes to  construct a structure that is both a manufactured home and a modular  home, the manufacturer need not make the certification provided for by  this section and may meet both the Federal manufactured home  requirements and any modular housing requirements. When the  certification is not made, all provisions of the Federal requirements  shall be met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any structure that meets the definition of manufactured home at  24 CFR 3282.7(u) is excluded from the coverage of the National  Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards   Act, 42 U.S.C. 5401 et seq., if the manufacturer certifies as prescribed  in paragraph (c) of this section that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The structure is designed only for erection or installation on a  site-built permanent foundation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A structure meets this criterion if all written materials and  communications relating to installation of the structure, including but  not limited to designs, drawings, and installation or erection  instructions, indicate that the structure is to be installed on a  permanent foundation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A site-built permanent foundation is a system of supports,  including piers, either partially or entirely below grade which is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Capable of transferring all design loads imposed by or upon the  structure into soil or bedrock without failure,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Placed at an adequate depth below grade to prevent frost damage,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Constructed of concrete, metal, treated lumber or wood, or  grouted masonry; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The structure is not designed to be moved once erected or  installed on a site-built permanent foundation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A structure meets this criterion if all written materials and  communications relating to erection or installation of the structure,  including but not limited to designs, drawings, calculations, and  installation or erection instructions, indicate that the structure is  not intended to be moved after it is erected or installed and if the  towing hitch or running gear, which includes axles, brakes, wheels and  other parts of the chassis that operate only during transportation, are  removable and designed to be removed prior to erection or installation  on a site-built permanent foundation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The structure is designed and manufactured to comply with the  currently effective version of one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> One of the following nationally recognized building codes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That published by Building Officials and Code Administrators  (BOCA) and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and made up  of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> BOCA Basic Building Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> BOCA Basic Industrialized Dwelling Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> BOCA Basic Plumbing Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> BOCA Basic Mechanical Code, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> National Electrical Code, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That published by the Southern Building Code Congress (SBCC) and  the NFPA and made up of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Standard Building Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Standard Gas Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Standard Mechanical Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Standard Plumbing Code, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> National Electrical Code, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> That published by the International Conference of Building  Officials (ICBO), the International Association of Plumbing and  Mechanical Officials (IAPMO), and the NFPA and made up of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Uniform Building Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Uniform Mechanical Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Uniform Plumbing Code, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> National Electrical Code or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The codes included in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A), (B), or (C) in  connection with the One- and Two-Family Dwelling Code, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Any combination of the codes included in paragraphs  (b)(3)(i)(A), (B), (C), and (D), that is approved by the Secretary,  including combinations using the National Standard Plumbing Code  published by the National Association of Plumbing, Heating and Cooling  Contractors (PHCC), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Any other building code accepted by the Secretary as a  nationally recognized model building code, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any local code or State or local modular building code accepted  as generally equivalent to the codes included under paragraph (b)(3)(i),  (the Secretary will consider the manufacturer's certification under  paragraph (c) of this section to constitute a certification that the  code to which the structure is built is generally equivalent to the  referenced codes.

The manufacturer  shall remove the original serial number and add the serial number  required by Sec. 3280.6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A manufacturer may not certify a structure under this section  after having applied the manufactured home serial number under Sec.  3280.6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> All certifications made under this section are subject to  investigation by the Secretary to determine their accuracy. If a  certification is false or inaccurate, the certification for purposes of  this section is invalid and the structures that have been or may be the  subject of the certification are not excluded from the coverage of the  Act, the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, or  these Regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the Secretary has information that a certification may be  false or inaccurate, the manufacturer will be given written notice of  the nature of this information by certified mail and the procedure of  this subparagraph will be followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer must investigate this matter and report its  findings in writing as to the validity of this information to the  Secretary within 15 days from the receipt of the Secretary's notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a written report is received within the time prescribed in  paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the Secretary will review this  report before determining whether a certification is false or  inaccurate.
