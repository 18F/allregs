                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Recalculating the total rent adjustment. To establish the amount of the retroactive HAP payment for which a project owner meeting the criteria in Sec. 888.401(c) is eligible, the total rent adjustment will be recalculated for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991. Rents for that period will be recalculated, under the procedures set out in 24 CFR 882.410(a)(1), by applying the AAF for any affected year, and recalculating the rents for the remainder of the period as necessary. For each year thereafter, all rent adjustments made at the request of the owner at the time will be recalculated, under the procedures in 24 CFR 882.410(a)(1), to account for the new adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Calculating the retroactive payment. HUD will pay, through the PHA, as a retroactive Housing Assistance Payment the amount, if any, by which the total rent adjustment, calculated under paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the rent adjustments actually approved for the same time period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Occupancy rate. (1) Retroactive payments will be made only for units that were occupied, based on average occupancy rate, including units qualifying for vacancy payments under 24 CFR 882.411, during the time period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When requesting a retroactive payment, a project owner must, if the

information is available, submit documentation of occupancy rates, on either an annual or monthly basis, for the same time period. The average occupancy rate will be based on these records. If records are unavailable for the full time period, the PHA will establish an average occupancy rate, to be used for the entire period, from the occupancy rate for the three years immediately preceding May 31, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Revised AAFs. For any year during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, where a HUD field office published a revised Annual Adjustment Factor that replaced the applicable AAF for a specific locality under 24 CFR 888.204, the revised Annual Adjustment Factor, which applied to all projects in that area, will be used to recalculate the total rent adjustment under paragraph (a) of this section, and to establish the amount of the retroactive payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special adjustments. When calculating the total rent adjustments and establishing the amount of the retroactive payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, any special adjustments granted under 24 CFR 882.410(a)(2) during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, to reflect substantial general increases in real property taxes, assessments, utility rates, utilities not covered by regulated rates, or for special adjustments for any other purpose authorized by a waiver of the regulations, will be deducted from the base rent before applying the AAF.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> AAFs less than 1.0. For any area where an AAF of less than 1.0 was published, a factor of 1.0 will be used to recalculate the total rent adjustments and to establish the amount of the retroactive payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
