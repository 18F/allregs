The plan shall be based upon the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan described in Sec. Sec. 11.81 of this part. The Plan shall describe how the monies will be used to address natural resources, specifically what restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the equivalent resources will occur. When damages for compensable value have been awarded, the Plan shall also describe how monies will be used to address the services that are lost to the public until restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources is completed. The Restoration Plan shall be prepared in accordance with the guidance set forth in Sec. 11.81 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No restoration activities shall be conducted by Federal agencies that would incur ongoing expenses in excess of those that would have been incurred under baseline conditions and that cannot be funded by the amount included in the separate account established pursuant to Sec. 11.92(a) of this part unless such additional monies are appropriated through the normal appropriations process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Modifications may be made to the Restoration Plan as become necessary as the restoration proceeds. Significant modifications shall be made available for review by any responsible party, any affected natural resource trustees, other affected Federal or State agencies or Indian tribes, and any other interested members of the public for a period of at least 30 days, with reasonable extensions granted as appropriate, before tasks called for in the modified plan are begun.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If the measure of damages was determined in accordance with subpart D, the restoration plan may describe actions to be taken that are to be financed from more than one damage award, so long as the actions are intended to address the same or similar resource injuries as those identified in each of the subpart D assessment procedures that were the basis of the awards.

Available data indicate the release may have occurred intermittently over a period of almost 1 year, although only one well about 300 feet downgradient of the facility boundary had detectable quantities of contaminants. The contaminated well is screened in the water table aquifer composed of gravelly sands. The facility boundary nearest the contaminated well is almost 3,000 feet in length, but a review of available data determined the release is probably localized along a 500-foot section of the boundary where a stream leaves the facility. Available water table data indicate hydraulic gradients in the valley range from 0.005 feet/mile up to 0.25 feet/mile near pumping wells. No pumping wells are known to be located near the release, and a mean hydraulic gradient of 0.1 feet/mile is estimated in the vicinity of the release site. Using the gravel factor from table 1, the LPL and LPW are estimated:
6000 x 0.1 x 1 = 600 feet (LPL)</p><p class="depth0">and600 x 0.2 = 120 feet (LPW).
Since the estimated LPW (120 feet) is less than the plume width (500 feet) determined from other available data, the greater number is used to compute the area potentially exposed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 600 feet x 500 feet = 300,000 square feet (about 6.9 acres). The available information allows an initial determination of area potentially exposed via the ground water pathway to be estimated:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 300 feet x 500 feet = 150,000 square feet (about 3.5 acres).</p><p class="depth0">The total area potentially exposed is the sum of (1) and (2):
6.9 + 3.5 = 10.4 acres.</p><p class="depth0">Surface Water</p><p class="depth0">The area of surface water resources potentially exposed should be estimated by applying the principles included in the examples provided below.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: A release occurs and most of the oil or hazardous substance enters a creek, stream, or river instantaneously or over a short time interval (pulse input is assumed). The maximum concentration at any downstream location, past the initial mixing distance, is estimated by:
Cp = 25(Wi)/(T\0.7\ Q)
where Cp is the peak concentration, in milligrams/liter (mg/</p><p class="depth0">L),
Wi is the total reported (or estimated) weight of the</p><p class="depth0">undiluted substance released, in pounds,Q is the discharge of the creek, stream, or river, in cubic feet/second,</p><p class="depth0">andT is the time, in hours, when the peak concentration is estimated to</p><p class="depth0">reach a downstream location L, in miles from the entry point.</p><p class="depth0">The time T may be estimated from:
T = 1.5(L)/Vs
where T and L are defined as above and
Vs is the mean stream velocity, in feet per second.
The mean stream velocity may be estimated from available discharge measurements or from estimates of slope of the water surface S (foot drop per foot distance downstream) and estimates of discharge Q (defined above) using the following equations:
for pool and riffle reaches Vs = 0.38(Q\0.40\)(S\0.20\), orfor channel-controlled reaches Vs = 2.69(Q\0.26\)(S\0.28\).
Estimates of S may be made from the slope of the channel, if necessary.</p><p class="depth0">As the peak concentrations become attenuated by downstream transport, the plume containing the released substance becomes

elongated. The time the plume might take to pass a particular point downstream may be estimated using the following equation:
Tp = 9.25 x 10\6\ Wi/(QCp)
where
Tp is the time estimate, in hours, and Wi, Cp, and Q are defined above.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2: A release occurs and most of the oil or hazardous substance enters a creek, stream, or river very slowly or over a long time period (sustained input assumed). The maximum concentration at any downstream location, past the initial mixing distance, is estimated by:
Cp = C(q)/(Q +

where Cp and Q are defined above,C is the average concentration of the released substance during the</p><p class="depth0">period of release, in mg/L, andq is the discharge rate of the release into the streamflow, in cubic</p><p class="depth0">feet/second.
For the above computations, the initial mixing distance may be estimated by:
Lm = (1.7 x 10-5)Vs B\2\/(D\1.5\</p><p class="depth0">S\0.5\)
where
Lm is the initial mixing distance, in miles,Vs is defined above,B is the average stream surface width, in ft,D is the mean depth of the stream, in ft, andS is the estimated water-surface slope, in ft/ft.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3: A release occurs and the oil or hazardous substance enters a pond, lake, reservoir, or coastal body of water. The concentration of soluble released substance in the surface water body may be estimated by:
Cp = CVc/(Vw + Vc)

where
Cp and C are defined above,Vc is the estimated total volume of substance released, in</p><p class="depth0">volumetric units, andVw is the estimated volume of the surface water body, in the</p><p class="depth0">same volumetric units used for Vc.
