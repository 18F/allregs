                                Sec. 1309.14  How will complaints against recipients be processed?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Receipt of complaints. Any individual who claims (individually  or on behalf of any specific class of individuals) that he or she has  been subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part (including  Sec. 1309.13) may file a written complaint with TVA. The written  complaint must be filed not later than 90 days from the date of the  alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by TVA  for good cause shown. A complaint shall be signed by the complainant,  give the   name and mailing address of the complainant and the recipient, identify  the TVA financial assistance involved, and state the facts and  occurrences (including dates) which led the complainant to believe that  an act of prohibited discrimination has occurred. Anonymous complaints  will not be accepted or filed under this section, but may be the basis  for a compliance review. TVA will reject any complaint which does not  fall within the coverage of the Act and this part, and may reject or  require supplementation or clarification of any complaint which does not  contain sufficient information for further processing as set forth in  this paragraph. A complaint shall not be deemed filed until all such  information has been provided to TVA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prompt resolution of complaints. The complaint shall be resolved  promptly. To this end, TVA shall proceed with the complaint without  undue delay so that the complaint is resolved within 180 calendar days  after it is filed with TVA. The recipient and complainant involved in  each complaint are required to cooperate in this effort. Failure to  cooperate on the part of the complainant may result in cancellation of  the complaint, while such failure on the part of the recipient may  result in enforcement action as described in Sec. 1309.15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mediation of complaints. All complaints which fall within the  coverage of the Act and this part will be referred to a mediation agency  designated by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The participation of the recipient and the complainant in the  mediation process is required, although both parties need not meet with  the mediator at the same time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the complainant and recipient reach a mutually satisfactory  resolution of the complaint during the mediation period, they shall  reduce the agreement to writing. The mediator shall send a copy of the  settlement to TVA. No further action shall be taken based on that  complaint unless it appears that the complainant or the recipient is  failing to comply with the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not more than 60 days after the complaint is filed, the mediator  shall return a still unresolved complaint to TVA for initial  investigation. The mediator may return a complaint at any time before  the end of the 60-day period if it appears that the complaint cannot be  resolved through mediation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all  information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator  shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or  otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the  mediation process without prior approval of the head of the agency  appointing the mediator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Investigation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> TVA will make a prompt investigation whenever  a complaint is unresolved within 60 days after it is filed with TVA or  is reopened because of a violation of the mediation agreement. The  investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the  pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances  under which the possible noncompliance with the Act and this part  occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether  the recipient has failed to comply with the Act and this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As part of the initial investigation, TVA shall use informal  fact finding methods including joint or individual discussions with the  complainant and recipient to establish the facts, and, if possible, to  resolve the complaint to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. TVA may  seek the assistance of any involved State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If TVA cannot resolve the matter within 10 calendar days after  the mediator returns the complaint, it shall complete the investigation,  attempt to achieve voluntary compliance satisfactory to TVA, if the  investigation indicates a violation, and arrange for enforcement as  described in Sec. 1309.15, if necessary.
