The (48 CFR) FAR 11.002(b) requirement to use the metric system of measurement for specifications and quantitative data that are incorporated in or required by USAID contracts may be waived when USAID determines in writing that such usage is impractical or is likely to cause U.S. firms to experience significant inefficiencies or the loss of markets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authorization. (1) The USAID Metric Executive (as designated in ADS Chapter 323), the contracting officer, and the USAID official who approves the procurement requirement are authorized to waive the metric requirement for one of the above reasons. The USAID Metric Executive is authorized

to overrule a decision to grant a waiver, or to nullify a blanket waiver made by another approving official so long as a contractor's rights under an executed contract are not infringed upon.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The USAID Metric Executive (as designated in ADS Chapter 323), the contracting officer, and the USAID official who approves the procurement requirement are authorized to waive the metric requirement for one of the above reasons.

Repetitive purchases of commercially produced and marketed items and classes of items may be consolidated in reporting procurements that do not exceed $10,000 cumulatively during the reporting period.
