                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Loan Administrator may require any applicant for a loan from the RLF to provide such collateral as the Loan Administrator determines to be necessary to secure the loan. (Section 803A(b)(3))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a Credit Factor. The availability of collateral security normally is considered an important factor in making loans. The types and amount of collateral security required should be governed by the relative strengths and weaknesses of other credit factors. The taking of collateral as security should be considered with respect to each loan. Collateral security should be sufficient to provide the lender reasonable protection from loss in the case of adversity, but such security or lack thereof should not be used as the primary basis for deciding whether to extend credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Security Interests. Security interests which may be taken by the lender include, but are not limited to, liens on real or personal property, including leasehold interests; assignments of income and accounts receivable; and liens on inventory or proceeds of inventory sales as well as marketable securities and cash collateral accounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Motor vehicles. Liens ordinarily should be taken on licensed motor vehicles, boats or aircraft purchased hereunder in order to be able to transfer title easily should the lender need to declare a default or repossess the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Insurance on property secured. Hazard insurance up to the amount of the loan or the replacement value of the property secured (whichever is less) must be taken naming the lender as beneficiary. Such insurance includes fire and extended coverage, public liability, property damage, and other appropriate types of hazard insurance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Appraisals. Real property serving as collateral security must be appraised by a qualified appraiser. For all other types of property, a valuation shall be made using any recognized, standard technique (including standard reference manuals), and this valuation shall be described in the loan file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional security. The lender may require collateral security or additional security at any time during the term of the loan if after review and monitoring an assessment indicates the need for such security.</p>
