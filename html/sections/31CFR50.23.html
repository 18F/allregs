                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em>, an insurer must offer coverage for insured losses  resulting from an act of terrorism that does not differ materially from  the terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations (including  deductibles) applicable to losses from other perils. For purposes of  this requirement, ``terms'' excludes price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitations on types of risk. If an insurer does not cover all  types of risks, then it is not required to cover the excluded risks in  satisfying the requirement to make available coverage   for losses resulting from an act of terrorism that does not differ  materially from the terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations  applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism.  For example, if an insurer does not cover all types of risks, either  because the insurer is outside of direct State regulatory oversight, or  because a State permits certain exclusions for certain types of losses,  such as nuclear, biological, or chemical events, then the insurer is not  required to make such coverage available.</p>
