                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of section 13(c), as shown by its legislative history,  is similar to a closely related provision contained in section 502(a) of  the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 536;  29 U.S.C. 502(a)). The fundamental purpose of Congress under 13(c) is to  insure against potential abuses arising from significant financial or  other influential interests affecting the objectivity of the plan or  parties in interest in the plan and agents, brokers, or surety or other  companies, in securing and providing the bond specified in section  13(a). As will be explained more fully below, this prohibition, however,  was not intended to preclude the placing of bonds through or with  certain parties in interest in plans which provide a variety of services  to the plan, one of which is a bonding service.</p>
