Sec. 3555.305 or 3555.306.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lenders must obtain Agency concurrence or a waiver as provided in Sec. 3555.301(h) before implementing any special servicing options.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use of special loan servicing does not change the terms of the loan note guarantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Special servicing options shall be used in the order established in this section to bring the borrower's mortgage payment to income ratio as close as possible to, but not less than, 31 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conditions for special servicing options. In addition to the requirements in Sec. 3555.303(a), the following conditions apply to all special loan servicing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The borrower's total debt to income ratio following the special loan servicing must not exceed 55 percent.

However, if a foreclosure was initiated and canceled prior to special loan servicing, legal fees and costs for work performed in relation to the foreclosure costs before the cancellation date may be charged to the borrower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Capitalization of late charges and lender fees is not permitted in the special loan servicing option.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Extended-term loan modification.

(1) The maximum amount of a mortgage recovery advance is the sum of arrearages not to exceed 12 months of PITI, annual fees, legal fees and foreclosure costs related to a cancelled foreclosure action, and principal reduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum amount of a mortgage recovery advance is the sum of arrearages not to exceed 12 months of PITI, annual fees, legal fees and foreclosure costs related to a cancelled foreclosure action, and principal reduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum amount of a mortgage recovery advance is 30 percent of the unpaid principal balance as of the date of default, minus any arrearages advanced to cure the default and any foreclosure costs incurred to that point. The Agency may change the maximum amount of mortgage recovery advance by publication in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The principal deferment amount for a specific case shall be limited to the amount that will bring the borrower's total monthly mortgage payment to 31 percent of gross monthly income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The lender may file a claim pursuant to Subpart H of this part for reimbursement of reasonable title search and/or recording fees in connection with the promissory note and mortgage or deed-of-trust, not to exceed a maximum amount specified by the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prior to making a mortgage recovery advance, the lender must perform an escrow analysis to ensure that the payment made on behalf of the borrower accurately reflects the escrow amount required for taxes and insurance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The following terms apply to the repayment of mortgage recovery advances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The mortgage recovery advance note and subordinate mortgage or deed-of-trust shall be interest-free.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Borrowers are not required to make any monthly or periodic payments on the mortgage recovery advance note; however, borrowers may voluntarily submit partial payments without incurring any prepayment penalty.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The due date for the mortgage recovery advance note shall be the due date of the guaranteed note held by the lender, as modified by the special loan servicing. Prior to the due date on the mortgage recovery advance note, payment in full under the note is due at the earlier of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> When the first lien mortgage and the guaranteed note are paid off; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> When the borrower transfers title to the property by voluntary or involuntary means.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Repayment of all or part of the mortgage recovery advance must be remitted directly to the Agency by the borrower.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The Agency will collect this Federal debt from the borrower by any available means if the mortgage recovery advance is not repaid based on the terms outlined in the promissory note and mortgage or deed-of-trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The lender may request reimbursement from the Agency for a mortgage recovery advance.
