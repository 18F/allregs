                                Sec. 1.1382-2  Taxable income of cooperatives; treatment of patronage
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In determining the taxable income of any  cooperative organization to which part I, subchapter T, chapter 1 of the  Code, applies, there shall be allowed as deductions from gross income,  in addition to the other deductions allowable under chapter 1 of the  Code, the deductions with respect to patronage dividends provided in  section 1382(b) and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the definition of terms used in this section see section  1388 and Sec. 1.1388-1; to determine the payment period for a taxable  year, see section 1382(d) and Sec. 1.1382-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deduction for patronage dividends--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. In the case  of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, there is allowed as  a deduction from the gross income of any cooperative organization to  which part I of subchapter T applies, amounts paid to patrons during the  payment period for   the taxable year as patronage dividends with respect to patronage  occurring during such taxable year, but only to the extent that such  amounts are paid in money, qualified written notices of allocation, or  other property (other than non qualified written notices of allocation).  See section 1382 (e) and (f) and Sec. Sec. 1.1382-5 and 1.1382-6 for  special rules relating to the time when patronage is deemed to occur  where products are marketed under a pooling arrangement or where  earnings are includible in the gross income of the cooperative  organization for a taxable year after the year in which the patronage  occurred. For purposes of this paragraph, a written notice of allocation  is considered paid when it is issued to the patron. A patronage dividend  shall be treated as paid in money during the payment period for the  taxable year to the extent it is paid by a qualified check which is  issued during the payment period for such taxable year and endorsed and  cashed on or before the ninetieth day after the close of such payment  period. In determining the amount paid which is allowable as a deduction  under this paragraph, property (other than written notices of  allocation) shall be taken into account at its fair market value when  paid, and a qualified written notice of allocation shall be taken into  account at its stated dollar amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for certain taxable years. No deduction is allowed  under this section for amounts paid during taxable years beginning  before January 1, 1963, or for amounts paid during taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1962, with respect to patronage occurring  during taxable years beginning before January 1, 1963. With respect to  such amounts, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (including section 522  and the regulations thereunder) shall be applicable without regard to  subchapter T.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deduction for amounts paid in redemption of certain nonqualified  written notices of allocation. In the case of a taxable year beginning  after December 31, 1962, there is allowed as a deduction from the gross  income of a cooperative organization to which part I of subchapter T  applies, amounts paid by such organization during the payment period for  such taxable year in redemption of a nonqualified written notice of  allocation which was previously paid as a patronage dividend during the  payment period for the taxable year during which the patronage occurred,  but only to the extent such amounts (1) are paid in money or other  property (other than written notices of allocation) and (2) do not  exceed the stated dollar amount of such written notice of allocation. No  deduction shall be allowed under this paragraph, however, for amounts  paid in redemption of nonqualified written notices of allocation which  were paid with respect to patronage occurring during a taxable year  beginning before January 1, 1963. For purposes of this paragraph, if an  amount is paid within the payment period for two or more taxable years,  it will be allowable as a deduction only for the earliest of such  taxable years. Thus, if a cooperative which reports its income on a  calendar year basis pays an amount in redemption of a nonqualified  written notice of allocation on January 15, 1966, it will be allowed a  deduction for such amount only for its 1965 taxable year. In determining  the amount paid which is allowable as a deduction under this paragraph,  property (other than written notices of allocation) shall be taken into  account at its fair market value when paid. Amounts paid in redemption  of a nonqualified written notice of allocation in excess of its stated  dollar amount shall be treated under the applicable provisions of the  Code. For example, if such excess is in the nature of interest, its  deductibility will be governed by section 163 and the regulations  thereunder.  [T.D. 6643, 28 FR 3154, Apr. 2, 1963]</p>
