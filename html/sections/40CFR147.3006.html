In addition to the requirements of Sec.  144.28(f)(3)(ii) of this chapter, the owner or operator shall, except during well stimulation, use an injection pressure measured at the wellhead that is not greater than the pressure calculated by using the following formula:
Pm=0.2d
where:
Pm=injection pressure at the wellhead in pounds per square inchd=depth in feet to the top of the injection zone.

Owners and operators shall comply with this requirement no later than

one year after the effective date of this program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rule-authorized Class II enhanced recovery and hydrocarbon storage wells.

The Director shall establish such maximum pressure after notice (including notice to the affected Tribe), opportunity for comment, and opportunity for public hearing according to the provisions of part 124, subpart A, of this chapter, and shall inform owners and operators and the affected Tribe in writing of the applicable maximum pressure; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to the requirements of Sec.  144.28(f)(3)(ii) of this chapter, owners and operators shall use an injection pressure no greater than the pressure established by the Director for the field or formation in which the well is located.
