                                Sec.  1.58-8  Capital gains and stock options.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(9)</em>, and Sec.  1.57-1(i) (capital gains),  which are attributable to sources within any foreign country or  possession of the United States shall not be taken into account as items  of tax preference if, under the tax laws of such country or possession,  preferential treatment is not accorded:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of stock options, to the gain, profit, or other  income realized from the transfer of shares of stock pursuant to the  exercise of an option which is under United States tax law a qualified  or restricted stock option (under section 422 or section 424); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of capital gains, to gain from the sale or exchange  of capital assets (or property treated as capital assets under United  States tax law).  Where capital gains are not accorded preferential treatment within a  foreign country, capital losses as well as capital gains from such  country are not taken into account for purposes of the minimum tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Source of capital gains and stock options. Generally, in  determining whether the capital gain or stock option item of tax  preference is attributable to sources within any foreign country or  possession of the United States, the principles of sections 861-863 and  the regulations thereunder are applied. Thus, the stock option item of  tax preference, representing compensation for personal services, is  attributable, in accordance with Sec.  1.861-4, to sources within the  country in which the personal services were performed. Where the capital  gain item of tax preference represents gain from the purchase and sale  of personal property, such gain is attributable, in accordance with  Sec.  1.861-7, entirely to sources within the country in which the  property is sold. In accordance with paragraph (c) of Sec.  1.861-7, in  any case in which the sales transaction is arranged in a particular  manner for the primary purpose of tax avoidance, all factors of the  transaction, such as negotiations, the execution of the agreement, the  location of the property, and the place of payment, will be considered,  and the sale will be treated as having been consummated at the place  where the substance of the sale occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Preferential treatment. For purposes of this section, gain,  profit, or other income is accorded preferential treatment by a foreign  country or possession of the United States if (1) recognition of the  income, for foreign tax purposes, is deferred beyond the taxpayer's  taxable year or comparable period for foreign tax purposes which  coincides with the taxpayer's U.S. taxable year in cases where other  items of profit, gain, or other income may not be deferred; (2) it is  subject to tax at a lower effective rate (including no rate of tax) than  other items of profit, gain, or other income, by means of a special rate  of tax, artifical deductions, exemptions, exclusions, or similar  reductions in the amount subject to tax; (3) it is subject to no  significant amount of tax; or (4) the laws of the foreign country or  possession by any other method provide tax treatment for such profit,  gain, or other income more beneficial than the tax treatment otherwise  accorded income by such country or possession. For the purpose of the  preceding sentence, gain, profit, or other income is subject to no  significant amount of tax if the amount of taxes imposed by the foreign  country or possession of the United States is   equal to less than 2.5 percent of the gross amount of such income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The principles of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. The Bahamas imposes no income tax on individuals or  corporations, whether resident or nonresident. Since capital gains are  subject to no tax in the Bahamas, capital gains are considered to be  accorded preferential treatment and will be taken into account for  purposes of the minimum tax.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. In France, except in certain cases involving the sale of  large blocks of stock, a nonresident individual is not subject to tax on  isolated capital gains transactions. Since such capital gains are not  subject to tax in France, they are considered to be accorded  preferential treatment irrespective of the treatment accorded other  capital gains in France and such gains will be taken into account for  purposes of the minimum tax.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. In Germany, in the case of the sale within 1 taxable year  of 1 percent or more of the shares of a corporation in which an  individual taxpayer is regarded as holding a substantial interest, the  gains on the sale of the large block of stock will be taxed as  extraordinary income at one-half the ordinary income tax rate. Since  these gains are taxed as a reduced rate of tax in comparison to other  income, they are considered to be accorded preferential treatment and  will be taken into account for purposes of the minimum tax.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. In Belgium, gains derived by an individual in the course  of regular speculative transactions are taxed as ordinary income, but  with an upper limit of 30 percent. Rates of tax on individuals in  Belgium range from approximately 30 percent to approximately 60 percent.  Since the gains on speculative transactions are taxed at a maximum rate  which is more beneficial then the rates accorded to other income, such  gains are considered to be accorded preferential treatment and will be  taken into account for purposes of the minimum tax.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. In France, gains derived by a company on the sale of  fixed assets held for less than 2 years are treated as short-term gains.  The excess of short-term gains in any fiscal year is taxed at the full  company tax rate of 50 percent. However, this tax may be paid in equal  portions over the 5 years immediately following the realization of such  short-term gains. Since recognition of the short-term gains for tax  purposes is subject to deferral over a 5-year period, such gains are  considered to be accorded preferential treatment and will be taken into  account for purposes of the minimum tax.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. Also in France, in the case of the sale or exchange by a  company of depreciable assets and nondepreciable asset owned for at  least 2 years, the excess of long-term capital gains over long-term  capital losses in a fiscal year is subject to an immediate tax at the  reduced rate of 10 percent. Such excess, reduced by the 10-percent tax,  is carried in a special reserve account on the taxpayer's books. If the  excess is reinvested in other fixed asset within a stated period, no  further tax is due. If the amounts in the special reserve are  distributed, they will be treated as ordinary income for the fiscal year  in which the distribution is made. Since such gains (other than those  distributed in the same fiscal year they are realized) are subject to  deferral or a reduced rate of tax, they are (except to the extent  distributed in the year of realization) considered to be accorded  preferential treatment and are taken into account for purposes of the  minimum tax.</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. In Sweden, in the case of gains derived by an individual  on the sale of shares or bonds held for 5 years or less, 25 percent of  the gains are taxed if the holding period is 4 to 5 years, 50 percent of  the gain is taxed if the holding period is 3 to 4 years, and 75 percent  of the gain is taxed if the holding period is 2 to 3 years. The gain is  fully taxable at ordinary income rates if held for less than 2 years.  Thus, gains on shares or bonds held for 2 years or more are considered  accorded preferential treatment in Sweden since they are either subject  to exemption or treatment comparable to the U.S. capital gains deduction  and are taxed at a reduced rate. Thus, such gains are taken into account  for purposes of the minimum tax.</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. Pursuant to Article XIV of the United States-United  Kingdom Income Tax Convention, a resident of the United States is exempt  from United Kingdom tax on most capital gains. Since such capital gains  are exempt from United Kingdom taxation, they are considered to be  accorded preferential treatment and are taken into account for purposes  of the minimum tax.</p><p class="depth2">Example 9. An individual resident of the United States, is desirous  of selling his stock in a corporation listed on the New York Stock  Exchange. He requests the stock certificates from his broker in the  United States, travels to a foreign country, delivers the certificates  to a broker in that country, and has the foreign broker execute the sale  which takes place on the New York Stock Exchange. Since the sale was  consummated in the United States, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this  section and Sec.  1.861-7, the resulting capital gain item of tax  preference is attributable to sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth2">Example 10. Two individuals, both residing in the United States,  negotiate and reach agreement in New York City for the sale of stock of  a closed corporation. Prior to the transfer of the stock, in order to  avoid imposition of the minimum tax, both individuals travel to a  foreign country which does not   accord preferential treatment to capital gains, but imposes a 5-percent  rate of income tax which would be fully creditable against U.S. tax  under sections 901 and 904 if the capital gains were sourced in that  country. The stock is actually transferred and consideration paid in the  foreign country. Since the primary purpose of consummating the sale in  the foreign country was the avoidance of tax, pursuant to paragraph (b)  of this section, and Sec.  1.861-7(c), the resulting capital gain item  of tax preference will be considered attributable to sources within the  country in which the substance of sale took place or, in this case, the  United States.
