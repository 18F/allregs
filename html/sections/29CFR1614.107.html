                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to a request for a hearing in a case, the agency shall dismiss an entire complaint:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That fails to state a claim under Sec. 1614.103 or Sec. 1614.106(a) or states the same claim that is pending before or has been decided by the agency or Commission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That fails to comply with the applicable time limits contained in Sec. Sec. 1614.105, 1614.106 and 1614.204(c), unless the agency extends the time limits in accordance with Sec. 1614.604(c), or that raises a matter that has not been brought to the attention of a Counselor and is not like or related to a matter that has been brought to the attention of a Counselor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That is the basis of a pending civil action in a United States District Court in which the complainant is a party provided that at least 180 days have passed since the filing of the administrative complaint, or that was the basis of a civil action decided by a United States District Court in which the complainant was a party;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where the complainant has raised the matter in a negotiated grievance procedure that permits allegations of discrimination or in an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board and Sec. 1614.301 or Sec. 1614.302 indicates that the complainant has elected to pursue the non-EEO process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> That is moot or alleges that a proposal to take a personnel action, or other preliminary step to taking a personnel action, is discriminatory, unless the complaint alleges that the proposal or preliminary step is retaliatory;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where the complainant cannot be located, provided that reasonable efforts have been made to locate the complainant and the complainant has not responded within 15 days to a notice of proposed dismissal sent to his or her last known address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where the agency has provided the complainant with a written request to provide relevant information or otherwise proceed with the complaint, and the complainant has failed to respond to the request within 15 days of its receipt or the complainant's response does not address the agency's request, provided that the request included a notice of the proposed dismissal. Instead of dismissing for failure to cooperate, the complaint may be adjudicated if sufficient information for that purpose is available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> That alleges dissatisfaction with the processing of a previously filed complaint; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Where the agency, strictly applying the criteria set forth in Commission decisions, finds that the complaint is part of a clear pattern of misuse of the EEO process for a purpose other than the prevention and elimination of employment discrimination. A clear pattern of misuse of the EEO process requires:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evidence of multiple complaint filings; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Allegations that are similar or identical, lack specificity or involve matters previously resolved; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Evidence of circumventing other administrative processes, retaliating against the agency's in-house administrative processes or overburdening the EEO complaint system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the agency believes that some but not all of the claims in a complaint should be dismissed for the reasons contained in paragraphs (a)(1) through (9) of this section, the agency shall notify the complainant in writing of its determination, the rationale for that determination and that those claims will not be investigated, and shall place a copy of the notice in the investigative file. A determination under this paragraph is reviewable by an administrative judge if a hearing is requested on the remainder of the complaint, but is not appealable until final action is taken on the remainder of the complaint.
