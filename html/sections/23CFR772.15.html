(1) No funds made available out of the Highway Trust Fund may be used to construct Type II noise barriers, as defined by this regulation, if such noise barriers were not part of a project approved by the FHWA before the November 28, 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Federal funds are available for Type II noise barriers along lands that were developed or were under substantial construction before approval of the acquisition of the rights-of-ways for, or construction of, the existing highway.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> FHWA will not approve noise abatement measures for locations where such measures were previously determined not to be feasible and reasonable for a Type I project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Noise abatement measures. The following noise abatement measures may be considered for incorporation into a Type I or Type II project to reduce traffic noise impacts. The costs of such measures may be included in Federal-aid participating project costs with the Federal share being the same as that for the system on which the project is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Construction of noise barriers, including acquisition of property rights, either within or outside the highway right-of-way. Landscaping is not a viable noise abatement measure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Traffic management measures including, but not limited to, traffic control devices and signing for prohibition of certain vehicle types, time-use restrictions for certain vehicle types, modified speed limits, and exclusive lane designations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Alteration of horizontal and vertical alignments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Acquisition of real property or interests therein (predominantly unimproved property) to serve as a buffer zone to preempt development which would be adversely impacted by traffic noise. This measure may be included in Type I projects only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Noise insulation of Activity Category D land use facilities listed in Table 1.
