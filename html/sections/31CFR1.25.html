To permit the accounting required by paragraph (a) of this section, system managers, with the approval of the head of their offices within a component, shall establish or implement, a system of accounting for all disclosures of records, either orally or in writing, made outside the Department of the Treasury.

The procedures may require the requester to provide reasonable identification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d)(2) of this section, each component shall establish and set forth in the appendix to this subpart applicable to the component, procedures for making the accounting required under paragraph (a) of this section available to the individual to whom the record pertains and shall thereafter make such accounting available in accordance therewith at the request of the individual.
