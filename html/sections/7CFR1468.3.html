                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions will apply to this part, and all documents issued in accordance with this part, unless specified otherwise:</p><p class="depth0">30-year Contract means an ACEP-WRE contract that is for a duration of 30 years and is limited to acreage owned by Indian Tribes.</p><p class="depth0">Access means legal and physical ingress and egress to the entire easement area over adjacent or contiguous lands for the exercise of any of the rights or interests under the easement for the duration of its term for the purposes of the program. Access for easement enrollments must be described in the easement deed.</p><p class="depth0">Acreage owned by Indian Tribes means lands held in private ownership by an Indian Tribe or individual Tribal member and lands held in trust by a native corporation, Tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p><p class="depth0">Active agricultural production means that on lands that meet the definition of being in agricultural use, agricultural or forest-related products or livestock are being produced or have been produced within one year of the date of application by an eligible entity for funding under subpart B of this part. Land may also be considered in active agricultural production if it is current or former CRP land that is planted, considered planted, or in conserving use as determined by NRCS.</p><p class="depth0">Agreement means the document that specifies the obligations and rights of NRCS and any person, legal entity, or eligible entity who is participating in the program or any document that authorizes the transfer of assistance between NRCS and a third party for provision of authorized goods and services associated with program implementation. Agreements may include but are not limited to an agreement to purchase, a wetland reserve easement restoration agreement, a cooperative agreement, a partnership agreement, or an interagency agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Agreement to purchase means the legal document that is the equivalent of a real estate purchase and sale contract. The landowner signs the agreement to purchase, which is the authorization for NRCS to proceed with the wetland reserve easement acquisition process and to incur costs for surveys, title clearance, due diligence activities, and closing procedures on the easement.</p><p class="depth0">Agricultural commodity means any agricultural commodity planted and produced in a State by annual tilling of the soil, including tilling by one-trip planters or sugarcane planted and produced in a State.</p><p class="depth0">Agricultural uses means those activities defined by a State's farm or ranch land protection program, or where no program exists, by the State agricultural use tax assessment program. However, if NRCS determines that a State definition of agricultural use is so broad that an included use would constitute a violation of Federal law, degrade soils, the agricultural nature of the land or the related natural resources, NRCS reserves the right to impose greater deed restrictions on the property to be subject to an agricultural land easement. These deed restrictions would narrow the State definition of agricultural use in order to meet Federal law, or to protect soils,

the agricultural nature of the land, or related natural resources.</p><p class="depth0">Agricultural land easement means an easement or other interest in eligible land that is conveyed for the purposes of protecting natural resources and the agricultural nature of the land, and of promoting agricultural viability for future generations, and permits the landowner the right to continue agricultural production and related uses subject to an agricultural land easement plan.</p><p class="depth0">Agricultural land easement plan means the document developed by NRCS or provided by the eligible entity and approved by NRCS, in consultation with the eligible entity and landowner, that describes the activities which promote the long-term viability of the land to meet the purposes for which the easement was acquired. The agricultural land easement plan includes a description of the farm or ranch management system, conservation practices that address the resource concerns for which the easement was enrolled, and any required component plans such as a grasslands management plan, forest management plan, or conservation plan as defined in this part. Where appropriate, the agricultural land easement plan will include conversion of highly erodible cropland to less intensive uses.</p><p class="depth0">Beginning farmer or rancher means an individual or legal entity who:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Has not operated a farm or ranch, or who has operated a farm or ranch for not more than 10 consecutive years and who will materially and substantially participate in the operation of the farm or ranch.

Material and substantial participation requires that each of the members provide some amount of the management or labor and management necessary for day-to-day activities, such that if each of the members did not provide these inputs, operation of the farm or ranch would be seriously impaired.</p><p class="depth0">Certified entity means an eligible entity that NRCS has determined to meet the certification requirements in 1468.27 for the purposes of ACEP-ALE.</p><p class="depth0">Chief means the Chief of the Natural Resources Conservation Service or the person delegated the authority to act for the Chief.</p><p class="depth0">Commenced conversion wetland means a wetland or converted wetland for which the Farm Service Agency (FSA) has determined that the wetland manipulation was contracted for, started, or for which financial obligation was incurred before December 23, 1985.</p><p class="depth0">Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is a wholly-owned government corporation within the Department of Agriculture.</p><p class="depth0">Compatible use means a use or activity conducted on a wetland reserve easement that NRCS determines, in its sole discretion, is consistent with the long-term protection and enhancement of the wetland and other natural values of the easement area when performed according to amount, method, timing, frequency, intensity, and duration limitations prescribed by NRCS.</p><p class="depth0">Conservation plan is the document that--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Applies to highly erodible cropland;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Describes the conservation system applicable to the highly erodible cropland and describes the decisions of the person with respect to location, land use, tillage systems, and conservation treatment measures and schedules and where appropriate, will include conversion of highly erodible cropland to less intensive uses; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Is developed in accordance with 7 CFR part 12.</p><p class="depth0">Conservation practice means a specified treatment, such as a vegetative, structural, or land management practice, that is planned and applied according to NRCS standards and specifications.</p><p class="depth0">Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) means the program administered by the CCC pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 3831-3836.</p><p class="depth0">Converted wetland means a wetland that has been drained, dredged, filled, leveled, or otherwise manipulated (including the removal of woody vegetation or any activity that results in impairing or reducing the flow, circulation, or reach of water) for the purpose of, or to have the effect of, making possible the production of an agricultural commodity if such production would not have been possible but for such action, and before such action such land was wetland, farmed wetland, or farmed-wetland pasture and was neither highly erodible land nor highly erodible cropland.</p><p class="depth0">Cooperative agreement means the document that specifies the obligations and rights of NRCS and eligible entities participating in the program under subpart B or the document that authorizes the transfer of assistance between NRCS and a non-Federal entity associated with implementation of the program under subpart C.</p><p class="depth0">Cost-share payment means the payment made by NRCS to an eligible entity for the purchase of an ALE easement as set forth in subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Dedicated fund means an account held by a nongovernmental organization which is sufficiently capitalized for the purpose of covering expenses associated with the management, monitoring, and enforcement of agricultural land easements and where such account cannot be used for other purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Easement area means the portion of a parcel that is encumbered by an ACEP easement.</p><p class="depth0">Easement exchange means a real estate transaction where NRCS, on behalf of the United States and in its sole discretion, relinquishes all or a portion of its real property rights or interests in an easement which are replaced by real property rights or interests granted through an easement that has equivalent or greater conservation value, acreage, and economic value to the United States on land that is not adjacent to the original easement area. NRCS is not required to exchange any of its rights in an easement, and easement exchanges are discretionary, voluntary, real estate transactions between the United States, landowner, and other parties with an interest in the easement.</p><p class="depth0">Easement modification means a real estate transaction where NRCS, on behalf of the United States and in its sole discretion, agrees to adjust the boundaries or terms of an easement that will result in equivalent or greater conservation value, acreage, and economic value to the United States, and the modification only involves lands within or physically adjacent to the original easement area.

rights in an easement or portion thereof to facilitate a project that addresses a compelling public need for which there is no practicable alternative and such termination action will result in equivalent or greater conservation value and economic value to the United States, and the United States is provided compensation for such termination. NRCS is not required to terminate any of its rights in an easement, and easement terminations are discretionary, voluntary, real estate transactions between the United States, landowner, and other parties that are subject to the requirements of this part. Unless and until the parties enter into a binding termination agreement, any party may withdraw its approval of a termination proposal at any time during the termination process.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible activity means an action other than a conservation practice that is included in the Wetland Reserve Plan of Operations (WRPO), as applicable, and that has the effect of alleviating problems or improving the condition of the resources, including ensuring proper management or maintenance of the wetland functions and values restored, protected, or enhanced through an easement or 30-year contract.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible entity means an Indian Tribe, State government, local government, or a nongovernmental organization which has a farmland or grassland protection program that purchases agricultural land easements for the purpose of protecting agriculture use and related conservation values, including grazing uses and related conservation values, by limiting conversion to nonagricultural uses of the land.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible land means private or Tribal land that NRCS has determined to meet the requirements of Sec. 1468.20 or Sec. 1468.30 of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Fair market value means the value of an agricultural land easement as determined using the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, an areawide market analysis or survey, or another industry-approved method approved by the Chief, as established in subpart B or, for a wetland reserve easement, the value of the land as determined using the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices or areawide market analysis or survey, as established in subpart C.</p><p class="depth0">Farm and ranch land of local importance means farm or ranch land used to produce food, feed, fiber, forage, bio-fuels, and oilseed crops that are locally important but not identified as having national or statewide importance.
