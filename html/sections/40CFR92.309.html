                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manufacturer or remanufacturers must submit the certification information as required under Sec. 92.306, and end-of-year reports each year as part of their participation in certification averaging, banking, and trading programs. All entities involved in credit trades or transfers must submit quarterly reports as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quarterly reports. (1) Those holding or receiving transferred credits as allowed in Sec. 92.303(m) must submit quarterly reports of their holdings or receipts when credits are gained or lost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Those holding or receiving transferred credits as allowed in Sec. 92.303(m) must submit quarterly reports of their holdings or receipts when credits are gained or lost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The reports shall include the source or recipient of the credits the amount of credits involved plus remaining balances, details regarding the pollutant, duty-cycle, and model year/Tier as well as the information prescribed in Sec. 92.308(c). Copies of contracts related to credit trading or transfer must be included or supplied by the buyer, seller, and broker, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> End-of-year reports must include the information prescribed in Sec. 92.308(b). The report shall include a calculation of credit balances for each family to show that the summation of the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's use of credits results in a credit balance equal to or greater than zero. The report shall be consistent in detail with the information submitted under Sec. 92.306 and show how credit surpluses were dispersed and how credit shortfalls were met on a family specific basis. The end-of-year report shall incorporate any information reflected in previous quarterly reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The applicable production/sales volume for quarterly and end-of-year reports must be based on the location of either the point of first retail sale by the manufacturer or remanufacturer or the point at which the locomotive is placed into service, whichever occurs first. This is called the final product purchase location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each quarterly and end-of-year report submitted shall include a statement certifying to the accuracy and authenticity of the material reported therein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requirements for submission. (1) Quarterly reports must be submitted within 90 days of the end of the calendar quarter to: Group Manager, Engine Compliance Programs Group, Engine Programs and Compliance Division U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 6403-J, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Quarterly reports must be submitted within 90 days of the end of the calendar quarter to: Group Manager, Engine Compliance Programs Group, Engine Programs and Compliance Division U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 6403-J, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> End-of-year reports must be submitted within 120 days of the end of the calendar year to: Group Manager, Engine Compliance Programs Group, Engine Programs and Compliance Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 6403-J, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure by a manufacturer or a remanufacturer participating in the averaging, banking, or trading program to submit any quarterly or end-of-year reports in the specified time for all engines is a violation of sections 203(a)(1) and 213 of the Clean Air Act for each locomotive or locomotive engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A manufacturer or remanufacturer generating credits for banking

only who fails to submit end-of-year reports in the applicable specified time period (120 days after the end of the calendar year) may not use or trade the credits until such reports are received and reviewed by EPA. Use of projected credits pending EPA review is not permitted in these circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reporting errors. (1) Errors discovered by EPA or the manufacturer or the remanufacturer as applicable in the end-of-year report, including errors in credit calculation, may be corrected 180-days subsequent to submission of the end-of-year report. Errors discovered by EPA after 180-days shall be correctable if, as a result of the correction, the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's credits are reduced. Errors in the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's favor are not corrected if discovered after the 180-day correction period allowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Errors discovered by EPA or the manufacturer or the remanufacturer as applicable in the end-of-year report, including errors in credit calculation, may be corrected 180-days subsequent to submission of the end-of-year report. Errors discovered by EPA after 180-days shall be correctable if, as a result of the correction, the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's credits are reduced. Errors in the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's favor are not corrected if discovered after the 180-day correction period allowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If EPA or the manufacturer or remanufacturer determines that a reporting error occurred on an end of year report previously submitted to EPA under this section, the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void. Erroneous negative credit balances may be corrected by EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If EPA review of a manufacturer's or remanufacturers end-of-year report indicates a credit shortfall, the manufacturer or remanufacturer will be permitted to purchase the necessary credits to bring the credit balance to zero. These credits must be supplied at the ratio of 1.1 credits for each 1.0 credit needed. If sufficient credits are not available to bring the credit balance to zero for the family(ies) involved, EPA may void the certificate(s) for that family(ies) ab initio. In addition, all locomotives and locomotive engines within an engine family for which there are insufficient credits will be considered to have violated the conditions of the certificate of conformity and therefore not covered by that certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If within 180 days of receipt of the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's end-of-year report, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's favor (that is, resulting in an increased credit balance) or if the manufacturer or remanufacturer discovers such an error within 180 days of EPA receipt of the end-of-year report, the credits are restored for use by the manufacturer or remanufacturer.</p><p class="depth3">Effective Date Note: At 63 FR 19057, Apr. 16, 1998, Sec. 92.309 was added. This section contains information collection and recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
