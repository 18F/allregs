                                Sec.  73.154  AM directional antenna partial proof of performance
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A partial proof of performance consists of at least 8 field  strength measurements made on each of the radials that includes a  monitoring point. If the directional pattern has fewer than 4 monitored  radials, the partial proof shall include measurements on those radials  from the latest complete proof of performance which are adjacent to the  monitored radials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The measurements are to be made within 3 to 15 kilometers from  the center of the antenna array. When a monitoring point as designated  on the station authorization lies on a particular radial, one of the  measurements must be made at that point. One of the following methods  shall be used for the partial proof:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measurement points shall be selected from the points measured in  latest full proof of performance provided that the points can be  identified with reasonable certainty, and that land development or other  factors have not significantly altered propagation characteristics since  the last full proof. At each point, the licensee shall measure  directional field strength for comparison to either the directional or  the nondirectional field strength measured at that point in the last  full proof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event that a meaningful comparison to full proof  measurements cannot be made, the licensee shall measure both directional  and nondirectional field strength at eight points on each radial. The  points need not be limited to those measured in the last full proof of  performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The results of the measurements are to be analyzed as follows.  Either the arithmetic average or the logarithmic average of the ratios  of the field strength at each measurement point to the corresponding  field strength in the most recent complete proof of performance shall be  used to establish the inverse distance fields. (The logarithmic average  for each radial is the antilogarithm of the mean of the logarithms of  the ratios of field strength (new to old) for each measurement location  along a given radial). When new nondirectional measurements are used as  the reference, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, either  the arithmetic or logarithmic averages of directional to nondirectional  field strength on each radial shall be used in conjunction with the  measured nondirectional field from the last proof to establish the  inverse distance field.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The result of the most recent partial proof of performance  measurements and analysis is to be retained in the station records  available to the FCC upon request. Maps showing new measurement points,  i.e., points not measured in the last full proof, shall be associated  with the partial proof in the station's records, and shall be provided  to the FCC upon request.
