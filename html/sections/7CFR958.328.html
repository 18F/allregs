Onions packed as U.S. Commercial grade in containers  weighing less than 60 pounds shall have the grade marked permanently and  conspicuously on the container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Inspection. No handler may handle any onions regulated hereunder  unless such onions are inspected by the Federal-State Inspection Service  and are covered by a valid applicable inspection certificate, except  when relieved of such requirement pursuant to paragraph (d), (e) or (g)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Onions for peeling, chopping, or slicing. Onions that have been  inspected and certified as meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)  and (b) of this section and that are subsequently peeled, chopped, or  sliced for fresh market within the production area may be handled  without reinspection: Provided the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each handler making shipments of onions for alteration or  performing alteration by peeling, chopping, or slicing must furnish the  committee the following information on the ``Fresh Cut Report'' and such  other documents as required:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Business name, address, telephone number, signature, and the  date the form was signed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date of peeling, chopping, or slicing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Inspection certificate number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The quantity of onions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Such other information as may be required by the committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Handlers who peel, chop, or slice onions produced outside the  production area must provide the committee with documentation showing  that the onions so prepared were produced outside the production area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special purpose shipments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The minimum grade, size,  maturity, pack, assessment, and inspection requirements of this section  shall not be applicable to shipments of onions for any of the following  purposes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Planting,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Livestock feed,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Charity,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Dehydration,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Canning,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Freezing,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Extraction,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Pickling, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Disposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shipments of onions for the purpose of experimentation, as  approved by the Committee, may be made without regard to the minimum  grade, size, maturity, pack, and inspection requirements of this  section.

Upon  cancellation of any such Certificate of Privilege the handler may appeal  to the committee for reconsideration. The committee may audit a receiver  or receiver's agent of the special purpose shipment to verify reports  and information submitted by handlers. Failure of a receiver or  receiver's agent of a special purpose shipment to comply with the  committee may be cause for cancellation of the receiver's or receiver  agent's eligibility to receive further special purpose shipments from  the production area. Upon cancellation of any such Certificate of  Privilege the receiver or the receiver's agent may appeal to the  committee for reconsideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Minimum quantity exemption.

The terms ``U.S. No. 1'', ``U.S. Commercial,'' and  ``U.S. No. 2'' have the same meaning as defined in the United States  Standards for Grades of Onions (Other than Bermuda Granex-Grano and  Creole Types), as amended (7 CFR 51.2830 through 51.2854), or the United  States Standards for Grades of Bermuda-Granex-Grano Type Onions (7 CFR  51.3195 through 51.3209), as amended, whichever is applicable to the  particular variety, or variations thereof specified in this section. The  term ``braided red onions'' means onions of red varieties with tops  braided (interlaced). ``Pearl onions'' means onions produced using  specific cultural practices that limit growth to   the same general size as boilers and picklers (defined in the United  States Standards specified in this paragraph), and that have been  inspected and certified as measuring 2 inches in diameter or less. The  term ``moderately cured'' means the onions are mature and are more  nearly well cured than fairly well cured. Other terms used in this  section have the same meaning as when used in Marketing Agreement No.  130 and this part.
