                                Sec. 1.132-5  Working condition fringes.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition. Gross income does not include the  value of a working condition fringe. A ``working condition fringe'' is  any property or service provided to an employee of an employer to the  extent that, if the employee paid for the property or service, the  amount paid would be allowable as a deduction under section 162 or 167.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A service or property offered by an employer in connection with  a flexible spending account is not excludable from gross income as a  working condition fringe. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a  flexible spending account is an agreement (whether or not written)  entered into between an employer and an employee that makes available to  the employee over a time period a certain level of unspecified non-cash  benefits with a pre-determined cash value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If, under section 274 or any other section, certain  substantiation requirements must be met in order for a deduction under  section 162 or 167 to be allowable, then those substantiation  requirements apply when determining whether a property or service is  excludable as a working condition fringe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An amount that would be deductible by the employee under a  section other than section 162 or 167, such as section 212, is not a  working condition fringe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A physical examination program provided by the employer is not  excludable as a working condition fringe even if the value of such  program might be deductible to the employee under section 213. The  previous sentence applies without regard to whether the employer makes  the program mandatory to some or all employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A cash payment made by an employer to an employee will not  qualify as a working condition fringe unless the employer requires the  employee to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Use the payment for expenses in connection with a specific or  pre-arranged activity or undertaking for which a deduction is allowable  under section 162 or 167,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Verify that the payment is actually used for such expenses, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Return to the employer any part of the payment not so used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The limitation of section 67(a) (relating to the two-percent  floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions) is not considered when  determining the amount of a working condition fringe.   For example, assume that an employer provides a $1,000 cash advance to  Employee A and that the conditions of paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this  section are not satisfied. Even to the extent A uses the allowance for  expenses for which a deduction is allowable under section 162 and 167,  because such cash payment is not a working condition fringe, section  67(a) applies. The $1,000 payment is includible in A's gross income and  subject to income and employment tax withholding. If, however, the  conditions of paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section are satisfied with  respect to the payment, then the amount of A's working condition fringe  is determined without regard to section 67(a). The $1,000 payment is  excludible from A's gross income and not subject to income and  employment tax reporting and withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Trade or business of the employee--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. If the  hypothetical payment for a property or service would be allowable as a  deduction with respect to a trade or business of an employee other than  the employee's trade or business of being an employee of the employer,  it cannot be taken into account for purposes of determining the amount,  if any, of the working condition fringe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The rule of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section may  be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that, unrelated to company X's trade or business  and unrelated to employee A's trade or business of being an employee of  company X, A is a member of the board of directors of company Y. Assume  further that company X provides A with air transportation to a company Y  board of director's meeting. A may not exclude from gross income the  value of the air transportation to the meeting as a working condition  fringe. A may, however, deduct such amount under section 162 if the  section 162 requirements are satisfied. The result would be the same  whether the air transportation was provided in the form of a flight on a  commercial airline or a seat on a company X airplane.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that A  serves on the board of directors of company Z and company Z regularly  purchases a significant amount of goods and services from company X.  Because of the relationship between Company Z and A's employer, A's  membership on Company Z's board of directors is related to A's trade or  business of being an employee of Company X. Thus, A may exclude from  gross income the value of air transportation to board meetings as a  working condition fringe.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that A  serves on the board of directors of a charitable organization. Assume  further that the service by A on the charity's board is substantially  related to company X's trade or business. In this case, A may exclude  from gross income the value of air transportation to board meetings as a  working condition fringe.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example (3) except that  company X also provides A with the use of a company X conference room  which A uses for monthly meetings relating to the charitable  organization. Also assume that A uses company X's copy machine and word  processor each month in connection with functions of the charitable  organization. Because of the substantial business benefit that company X  derives from A's service on the board of the charity, A may exclude as a  working condition fringe the value of the use of company X property in  connection with the charitable organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Vehicle allocation rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. In  general, with respect to an employer-provided vehicle, the amount  excludable as a working condition fringe is the amount that would be  allowable as a deduction under section 162 or 167 if the employee paid  for the availability of the vehicle. For example, assume that the value  of the availability of an employer-provided vehicle for a full year is  $2,000, without regard to any working condition fringe (i.e., assuming  all personal use). Assume Further that the employee drives the vehicle  6,000 miles for his employer's business and 2,000 miles for reasons  other than the employer's business. In this situation, the value of the  working condition fringe is $2,000 multiplied by a fraction, the  numerator of which is the business-use mileage (6,000 miles) and the  denominator of which is the total mileage (8,000 miles). Thus, the value  of the working condition fringe is $1,500. The total amount includible  in the employee's gross income on account of the availability of the  vehicle is $500 ($2,000-$1,500). For purposes of this section, the term  ``vehicle'' has the meaning given the term in Sec. 1.61-21(e)(2).  Generally, when determining the amount of an employee's working  condition fringe, miles accumulated on   the vehicle by all employees of the employer during the period in which  the vehicle is available to the employee are considered. For example,  assume that during the year in which the vehicle is available to the  employee in the above example, other employees accumulate 2,000  additional miles on the vehicle (while the employee is not in the  automobile). In this case, the value of the working condition fringe is  $2,000 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the business- use mileage by the employee (including all mileage (business and  personal) accumulated by other employees) (8,000 miles) and the  denominator of which is the total mileage (including all mileage  accumulated by other employees) (10,000 miles). Thus, the value of the  working condition fringe is $1,600; the total amount includible in the  employee's gross income on account of the availability of the vehicle is  $400 ($2,000-$1,600). If, however, substantially all of the use of the  automobile by other employees in the employer's business is limited to a  certain period, such as the last three months of the year, the miles  driven by the other employees during that period would not be considered  when determining the employee's working condition fringe exclusion.  Similarly, miles driven by other employees are not considered if the  pattern of use of the employer-provided automobiles is designed to  reduce Federal taxes. For example, assume that an employer provides  employees A and B each with the availability of an employer-provided  automobile and that A uses the automobile assigned to him 80 percent for  the employer's business and that B uses the automobile assigned to him  30 percent for the employer's business. If A and B alternate the use of  their assigned automobiles each week in such a way as to achieve a  reduction in federal taxes, then the employer may count only miles  placed on the automobile by the employee to whom the automobile is  assigned when determining each employee's working condition fringe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use by an individual other than the employee. For purposes of  this section, if the availability of a vehicle to an individual would be  taxed to an employee, use of the vehicle by the individual is included  in references to use by the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Provision of an expensive vehicle for personal use. If an  employer provides an employee with a vehicle that an employee may use in  part for personal purposes, there is no working condition fringe  exclusion with respect to the personal miles driven by the employee; if  the employee paid for the availability of the vehicle, he would not be  entitled to deduct under section 162 or 167 any part of the payment  attributable to personal miles. The amount of the inclusion is not  affected by the fact that the employee would have chosen the  availability of a less expensive vehicle. Moreover, the result is the  same even though the decision to provide an expensive rather than an  inexpensive vehicle is made by the employer for bona fide  noncompensatory business reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>  is not available if the employer is valuing the use or availability of a  vehicle under general valuation principles or a special valuation rule  other than the automobile lease valuation rule. See Sec. Sec. 1.162-25  and 1.162-25T for rules relating to the employee's deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Shared usage. In calculating the working condition fringe  benefit exclusion with respect to a vehicle provided for use by more  than one employee, an employer shall compute the working condition  fringe in a manner consistent with the allocation of the value of the  vehicle under section 1.61-21(c)(2)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use of different employer-provided vehicles. The working  condition fringe exclusion must be applied on a vehicle-by-vehicle  basis. For example, assume that automobile Y is available to employee D  for 3 days in January and for   5 days in March, and automobile Z is available to D for a week in July.  Assume further that the Daily Lease Value, as defined in Sec. 1.61- 21(d)(4)(ii), of each automobile is $50. For the eight days of  availability of Y in January and March, D uses Y 90 percent for business  (by mileage). During July, D uses Z 60 percent for business (by  mileage). The value of the working condition fringe is determined  separately for each automobile. Therefore, the working condition fringe  for Y is $360 ($400x.90) leaving an income inclusion of $40. The working  condition fringe for Z is $210 ($350x.60), leaving an income inclusion  of $140. If the value of the availability of an automobile is determined  under the Annual Lease Value rule for one period and Daily Lease Value  rule for a second period (see Sec. 1.61-21(d)), the working condition  fringe exclusion must be calculated separately for the two periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Provision of a vehicle and chauffeur services--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule.  In general, with respect to the value of chauffeur services provided by  an employer, the amount excludable as a working condition fringe is the  amount that would be allowable as a deduction under section 162 and 167  if the employee paid for the chauffeur services. The working condition  fringe with respect to a chauffeur is determined separately from the  working condition fringe with respect to the vehicle. An employee may  exclude from gross income the excess of the value of the chauffeur  services over the value of the chauffeur services for personal purposes  (such as commuting) as determined under Sec. 1.61-21(b)(5). See Sec.  1.61-21(b)(5) for additional rules and examples concerning the valuation  of chauffeur services. See Sec. 1.132-5(m)(5) for rules relating to an  exclusion from gross income for the value of bodyguard/chauffeur  services. When determining whether miles placed on the vehicle are for  the employer's business, miles placed on the vehicle by a chauffeur  between the chauffeur's residence and the place at which the chauffeur  picks up (or drops off) the employee are with respect to the employee  (but not the chauffeur) considered to be miles placed on the vehicle for  the employer's business and thus eligible for the working condition  fringe exclusion. Thus, because miles placed on the vehicle by a  chauffeur between the chauffeur's residence and the place at which the  chauffeur picks up (or drops off) the employee are not considered  business miles with respect to the chauffeur, the value of the  availability of the vehicle for commuting is includible in the gross  income of the chauffeur. For general and special rules concerning the  valuation of the use of employer-provided vehicles, see paragraphs (b)  through (f) of Sec. 1.61-21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The rules of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section are  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that an employer makes available to an employee an  automobile and a chauffeur. Assume further that the value of the  chauffeur services determined in accordance with Sec. 1.61-21 is  $30,000 and that the chauffeur spends 30 percent of each workday driving  the employee for personal purposes. There may be excluded from the  employee's income 70 percent of $30,000, or $21,000, leaving an income  inclusion with respect to the chauffeur services of $9,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that the value of the availability of an employer- provided vehicle for a year is $4,850 and that the value of employer- provided chauffeur services with respect to the vehicle for the year is  $20,000. Assume further that 40 percent of the miles placed on the  vehicle are for the employer's business and that 60 percent are for  other purposes. In addition, assume that the chauffeur spends 25 percent  of each workday driving the employee for personal purposes (i.e., 2  hours). The value of the chauffeur services includible in the employee's  income is 25 percent of $20,000, or $5,000. The excess of $20,000 over  $5,000 or $15,000 is excluded from the employee's income as a working  condition fringe. The amount excludable as a working condition fringe  with respect to the vehicle is 40 percent of $4,850, or $1,940 and the  amount includible is $4,850-$1,940, or $2,910.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicability of substantiation requirements of sections 162 and  274(d)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The value of property or services provided to an  employee may not be excluded from the employee's gross income as a  working condition fringe, by either the employer or the employee, unless  the applicable substantiation requirements of either section 274(d) or  section 162 (whichever is applicable) and the regulations thereunder are  satisfied. The substantiation requirements of section 274(d) apply to an  employee even if the requirements   of section 274 do not apply to the employee's employer for deduction  purposes (such as when the employer is a tax-exempt organization or a  governmental unit).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 274(d) requirements. The substantiation requirements of  section 274(d) are satisfied by ``adequate records or sufficient  evidence corroborating the [employee's] own statement''. Therefore, such  records or evidence provided by the employee, and relied upon by the  employer to the extent permitted by the regulations promulgated under  section 274(d), will be sufficient to substantiate a working condition  fringe exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Safe harbor substantiation rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 1.274- 6T provides that the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and  the regulations thereunder may be satisfied, in certain circumstances,  by using one or more of the safe harbor rules prescribed in Sec. 1.274- 6T. If the employer uses one of the safe harbor rules prescribed in  Sec. 1.274-6T during a period with respect to a vehicle (as defined in  Sec. 1.61-21(e)(2)), that rule must be used by the employer to  substantiate a working condition fringe exclusion with respect to that  vehicle during the period. An employer that is exempt from Federal  income tax may still use one of the safe harbor rules (if the  requirements of that section are otherwise met during a period) to  substantiate a working condition fringe exclusion with respect to a  vehicle during the period. If the employer uses one of the methods  prescribed in Sec. 1.274-6T during a period with respect to an  employer-provided vehicle, that method may be used by an employee to  substantiate a working condition fringe exclusion with respect to the  same vehicle during the period, as long as the employee includes in  gross income the amount allocated to the employee pursuant to Sec.  1.274-6T and this section. (See Sec. 1.61-21(c)(2) for other rules  concerning when an employee must include in income the amount determined  by the employer.) If, however, the employer uses the safe harbor rule  prescribed in Sec. 1.274-6T(a) (2) or (3) and the employee without the  employer's knowledge uses the vehicle for purposes other than de minimis  personal use (in the case of the rule prescribed in Sec. 1.274- 6T(a)(2)), or for purposes other than de minimis personal use and  commuting (in the case of the rule prescribed in Sec. 1.274-6T(a)(3)),  then the employees must include an additional amount in income for the  unauthorized use of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Period for use of safe harbor rules. The rules prescribed in  this paragraph (d) assume that the safe harbor rules prescribed in Sec.  1.274-6T are used for a one-year period. Accordingly, references to the  value of the availability of a vehicle, amounts excluded as a working  condition fringe, etc., are based on a one-year period. If the safe  harbor rules prescribed in Sec. 1.274-6T are used for a period of less  than a year, the amounts referred to in the previous sentence must be  adjusted accordingly. For purposes of this section, the term ``personal  use'' has the same meaning as prescribed in Sec. 1.274-6T (e)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Safe harbor substantiation rule for vehicles not used for  personal purposes. For a vehicle described in Sec. 1.274-6T(a)(2)  (relating to certain vehicles not used for personal purposes), the  working condition fringe exclusion is equal to the value of the  availability of the vehicle if the employer uses the method prescribed  in Sec. 1.274-6T(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em>, is used and  the amount determined under the special rule is either included in the  employee's income or reimbursed by the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Safe harbor substantiation rule for vehicles used in connection  with the business of farming that are available to employees for  personal use--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For a vehicle described in Sec. 1.274- 6T(b) (relating to certain vehicles used in connection with the business  of farming), the working condition fringe exclusion is calculated by  multiplying   the value of the availability of the vehicle by 75 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Vehicles available to more than one individual. If the vehicle  is available to more than one individual, the employer must allocate the  gross income inclusion attributable to the vehicle (25 percent of the  value of the availability of the vehicle) among the employees (and other  individuals whose use would not be attributed to an employee) to whom  the vehicle was available. This allocation must be done in a reasonable  manner to reflect the personal use of the vehicle by the individuals. An  amount that would be allocated to a sole proprietor reduces the amounts  that may be allocated to employees but is otherwise to be disregarded  for purposes of this paragraph (g). For purposes of this paragraph (g),  the value of the availability of a vehicle may be calculated as if the  vehicle were available to only one employee continuously and without  regard to any working condition fringe exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate a reasonable  allocation of gross income with respect to an employer-provided vehicle  between two employees:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that two farm employees share the use of a vehicle  that for a calendar year is regularly used directly in connection with  the business of farming and qualifies for use of the rule in Sec.  1.274-6T(b). Employee A uses the vehicle in the morning directly in  connection with the business of farming and employee B uses the vehicle  in the afternoon directly in connection with the business of farming.  Assume further that employee B takes the vehicle home in the evenings  and on weekends. The employer should allocate all the income  attributable to the availability of the vehicle to employee B.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that for a calendar year, farm employees C and D  share the use of a vehicle that is regularly used directly in connection  with the business of farming and qualifies for use of the rule in Sec.  1.2.4-6T(b). Assume further that the employees alternate taking the  vehicle home in the evening and alternate the availability of the  vehicle for personal purposes on weekends. The employer should allocate  the income attributable to the availability of the vehicle for personal  use (25 percent of the value of the availability of the vehicle) equally  between the two employees.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that C is  the sole proprietor of the farm. Based on these facts, C should allocate  the same amount of income to D as was allocated to D in example (2). No  other income attributable to the availability of the vehicle for  personal use should be allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Qualified nonpersonal use vehicles--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as  provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, 100 percent of the value  of the use of a qualified nonpersonal use vehicle (as described in Sec.  1.274-5(k)) is excluded from gross income as a working condition fringe,  provided that, in the case of a vehicle described in Sec. 1.274-5(k)(3)  through (8), the use of the vehicle conforms to the requirements of  paragraphs (k)(3) through (8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)(L)</em> or (P).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> does not affect  the applicability of section 280F to the employer with respect to such  employer-provided automobile, nor does it affect the applicability of  section 274 to either the employer or the employee. For rules concerning  substantiation of an   employee's working condition fringe, see paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Aircraft allocation rule. In general, with respect to a flight  on an employer-provided aircraft, the amount excludable as a working  condition fringe is the amount that would be allowable as a deduction  under section 162 or 167 if the employee paid for the flight on the  aircraft. For example, if employee P and P's spouse fly on P's  employer's airplane primarily for business reasons of P's employer so  that P could deduct the expenses relating to the trip to the extent of  P's payments, the value of the flights is excludable from gross income  as a working condition fringe. However, if P's children accompany P on  the trip primarily for personal reasons, the value of the flights by P's  children are includible in P's gross income. See Sec. 1.61-21 (g) for  special rules for valuing personal flights on employer-provided  aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Employer-provided transportation for security concerns--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. The amount of a working condition fringe exclusion with respect  to employer-provided transportation is the amount that would be  allowable as a deduction under section 162 or 167 if the employee paid  for the transportation. Generally, if an employee pays for  transportation taken for primarily personal purposes, the employee may  not deduct any part of the amount paid. Thus, the employee may not  generally exclude the value of employer-provided transportation as a  working condition fringe if such transportation is primarily personal.  If, however, for bona fide business-oriented security concerns, the  employee purchases transportation that provides him or her with  additional security, the employee may generally deduct the excess of the  amount actually paid for the transportation over the amount the employee  would have paid for the same mode of transportation absent the bona fide  business-oriented security concerns. This is the case whether or not the  employee would have taken the same mode of transportation absent the  bona fide business-oriented security concerns. With respect to a  vehicle, the phrase ``the same mode of transportation'' means use of the  same vehicle without the additional security aspects, such as  bulletproof glass. With respect to air transportation, the phrase ``the  same mode of transportation'' means comparable air transportation. These  same rules apply to the determination of an employee's working condition  fringe exclusion. For example, if an employer provides an employee with  a vehicle for commuting and, because of bona fide business-oriented  security concerns, the vehicle is specially designed for security, then  the employee may exclude from gross income the value of the special  security design as a working condition fringe. The employee may not  exclude the value of the commuting from income as a working condition  fringe because commuting is a nondeductible personal expense. However,  if an independent security study meeting the requirements of paragraph  (m)(2)(v) of this section has been performed with respect to a  government employee, the government employee may exclude the value of  the personal use (other than commuting) of the employer-provided vehicle  that the security study determines to be reasonable and necessary for  local transportation. Similarly, if an employee travels on a personal  trip in an employer-provided aircraft for bona fide business-oriented  security concerns, the employee may exclude the excess, if any, of the  value of the flight over the amount the employee would have paid for the  same mode of transportation, but for the bona fide business-oriented  security concerns. Because personal travel is a nondeductible expense,  the employee may not exclude the total value of the trip as a working  condition fringe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Demonstration of bona fide business-oriented security concerns-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this paragraph (m), a bona fide  business-oriented security concern exists only if the facts and  circumstances establish a specific basis for concern regarding the  safety of the employee. A generalized concern for an employee's safety  is not a bona fide business-oriented security concern. Once a bona fide  business-oriented security concern is determined to exist with respect  to a particular employee, the employer must periodically evaluate the  situation for purposes of determining whether the bona fide business-   oriented security concern still exists. Example of factors indicating a  specific basis for concern regarding the safety of an employee are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A threat of death or kidnapping of, or serious bodily harm to,  the employee or a similarly situated employee because of either  employee's status as an employee of the employer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A recent history of violent terrorist activity (such as  bombings) in the geographic area in which the transportation is  provided, unless that activity is focused on a group of individuals  which does not include the employee (or a similarly situated employee of  an employer), or occurs to a significant degree only in a location  within the geographic area where the employee does not travel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Establishment of overall security program. Notwithstanding  anything in paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section to the contrary, no bona  fide business-oriented security concern will be deemed to exist unless  the employee's employer establishes to the satisfaction of the  Commissioner that an overall security program has been provided with  respect to the employee involved. An overall security program is deemed  to exist if the requirements of paragraph (m)(2)(iv) of this section are  satisfied (relating to an independent security study).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Overall security program--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Defined. An overall security  program is one in which security is provided to protect the employee on  a 24-hour basis. The employee must be protected while at the employee's  residence, while commuting to and from the employee's workplace, and  while at the employee's workplace. In addition, the employee must be  protected while traveling both at home and away from home, whether for  business or personal purposes. An overall security program must include  the provision of a bodyguard/chauffeur who is trained in evasive driving  techniques; an automobile specially equipped for security; guards, metal  detectors, alarms, or similar methods of controlling access to the  employee's workplace and residence; and, in appropriate cases, flights  on the employer's aircraft for business and personal reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Application. There is no overall security program when, for  example, security is provided at the employee's workplace but not at the  employee's residence. In addition, the fact that an employer requires an  employee to travel on the employer's aircraft, or in an employer- provided vehicle that contains special security features, does not alone  constitute an overall security program. The preceding sentence applies  regardless of the existence of a corporate or other resolution requiring  the employee to travel in the employer's aircraft or vehicle for  personal as well as business reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A security study is performed with respect to the employer and  the employee (or a similarly situated employee of the employer) by an  independent security consultant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The security study is based on an objective assessment of all  facts and circumstances;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The recommendation of the security study is that an overall  security program (as defined in paragraph (m)(2)(iii) of this section)  is not necessary and the recommendation is reasonable under the  circumstances; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The employer applies the specific security recommendations  contained in the security study to the employee on a consistent basis.  The value of transportation-related security provided pursuant to a  security study that meets the requirements of this paragraph (m)(2)(iv)  may be excluded from income if the security study conclusions are  reasonable and, but for the bona fide business-oriented security  concerns, the employee would not have had such security. No exclusion  from income applies to security provided by the employer that is not  recommended in the security study. Security study conclusions may be  reasonable even if, for example, it is recommended that security be  limited to certain geographic areas, as in the case in which air travel  security is provided only in certain foreign countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Independent security study with respect to government employees.  For purposes of establishing the existence of an overall security  program under paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section with respect to a  particular government employee, a security study conducted by the  government employer (including an agency or instrumentality thereof)  will be treated as a security study pursuant to paragraph (m)(2)(iv) of  this section if, in lieu of the conditions of paragraphs (m)(2)(iv)(A)  through (D) of this section, the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The security study is conducted by a person expressly designated  by the government employer as having the responsibility and independent  authority to determine both the need for employer-provided security and  the appropriate protective services in response to that determination;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The security study is conducted in accordance with written  internal procedures that require an independent and objective assessment  of the facts and circumstances, such as the nature of the threat to the  employee, the appropriate security response to that threat, an estimate  of the length of time protective services will be necessary, and the  extent to which employer-provided transportation may be necessary during  the period of protection;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> With respect to employer-provided transportation, the security  study evaluates the extent to which personal use, including commuting,  by the employee and the employee's spouse and dependents may be  necessary during the period of protection and makes a recommendation as  to what would be considered reasonable personal use during that period;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The employer applies the specific security recommendations  contained in the study to the employee on a consistent basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application of security rules to spouses and dependents--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. If a bona fide business-oriented security concern exists with  respect to an employee (because, for example, threats are made on the  life of an employee), the bona fide business-oriented security concern  is deemed to exist with respect to the employee's spouse and dependents  to the extent provided in this paragraph (m)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain transportation. If a working condition fringe exclusion  is available under this paragraph (m) for transportation in a vehicle or  aircraft provided for a bona fide business-oriented security concern  with respect to an employee, the requirements of this paragraph (m) are  deemed to be satisfied with respect to transportation in the same  vehicle or aircraft provided at the same time to the employee's spouse  and dependent children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> or (iv) of this section are  applied independently to such spouse and dependent children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Spouses and dependents of government employees. The security  rules of this paragraph (m)(3) apply to the spouse and dependents of a  government employee. However, the value of local vehicle transportation  provided to the government employee's spouse and dependents for personal  purposes, other than commuting, during the period that a bona fide  business-oriented security concern exists with respect to the government  employee will not be included in the government employee's gross income  if the personal use is determined to be reasonable and necessary by the  security study described in paragraph (m)(2)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> is available to exclude the excess value  of the aircraft trips over the safe harbor airfares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em>. (See paragraph (b)(3) of this section for rules  relating to the determination of the working condition fringe exclusion  for chauffeur services.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special valuation rule for government employees. If  transportation is provided to a government employee for commuting during  the period that a bona fide business-oriented security concern under  Sec. 1.132-5(m) exists, the commuting use may be valued by reference to  the values set forth in Sec. 1.61-21(e)(1)(i) or (f)(3) (vehicle cents- per-mile or commuting valuation of $1.50 per one-way commute,  respectively) without regard to the additional requirements contained in  Sec. 1.61-21 (e) or (f) and is deemed to have met the requirements of  Sec. 1.61-21(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Government employer and employee defined. For purposes of this  paragraph (m), ``government employer'' includes any Federal, State, or  local government unit, and any agency or instrumentality thereof. A  ``government employee'' is any individual who is employed by the  government employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (m) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that in response to several death threats on the  life of A, the president of X a multinational company, X establishes an  overall security program for A, including an alarm system at A's home  and guards at A's workplace, the use of a vehicle that is specially  equipped with alarms, bulletproof glass, and armor plating, and a  bodyguard/chauffeur. Assume further that A is driven for both personal  and business reasons in the vehicle. Also, assume that but for the bona  fide business-oriented security concerns, no part of the overall  security program would have been provided to A. With respect to the  transportation provided for security reasons, A may exclude as a working  condition fringe the value of the special security features of the  vehicle and the value attributable to the bodyguard/chauffeur. Thus, if  the value of the specially equipped vehicle is $40,000, and the value of  the vehicle without the security features is $25,000, A may determine  A's inclusion in income attributable to the vehicle as if the vehicle  were worth $25,000. A must include in income the value of the  availability of the vehicle for personal use.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that B is the chief executive officer of Y, a  multinational corporation. Assume further that there have been  kidnapping attempts and other terrorist activities in the foreign  countries in which B performs services and that at least some of such  activities have been directed against B or similarly situated employees.  ln response to these activities, Y provides B with an overall security  program, including an alarm system at B's home and bodyguards at B's  workplace, a bodyguard/chauffeur, and a vehicle specially designed for  security during B's overseas travels. In addition, assume that Y  requires B to travel in Y's airplane   for business and personal trips taken to, from, and within these foreign  countries. Also, assume that but for bona fide business-oriented  security concerns, no part of the overall security program would have  been provided to B. B may exclude as a working condition fringe the  value of the special security features of the automobile and the value  attributable to the bodyguards and the bodyguard/chauffeur. B may also  exclude the excess, if any, of the value of the flights over the amount  A would have paid for the same mode of transportation but for the  security concerns. As an alternative to the preceding sentence, B may  use the working condition safe harbor described in paragraph (m)(4) of  this section and exclude as a working condition fringe the excess, if  any, of the value of personal flights in the Y airplane over the safe  harbor airfare determined under the method described in paragraph (m)(4)  of this section. If this alternative is used, B must include in income  the value of the availability of the vehicle for personal use and the  value of the safe harbor.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that Y  also requires B to travel in Y's airplane within the United States, and  provides B with a chauffeur-driven limousine for business and personal  travel in the United States. Assume further that Y also requires B's  spouse and dependents to travel in Y's airplane for personal flights in  the United States. If no bona fide business-oriented security concern  exists with respect to travel in the United States, B may not exclude  from income any portion of the value of the availability of the  chauffeur or limousine for personal use in the United States. Thus, B  must include in income the value of the availability of the vehicle and  chauffeur for personal use. In addition, B may not exclude any portion  of the value attributable to personal flights by B or B's spouse and  dependents on Y's airplane. Thus, B must include in income the value  attributable to the personal use of Y's airplane. See Sec. 1.61-21 for  rules relating to the valuation of an employer-provided vehicle and  chauffeur, and personal flights on employer-provided airplanes.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume that company Z retains an independent security  consultant to perform a security study with respect to its chief  executive officer. Assume further that, based on an objective assessment  of the facts and circumstances, the security consultant reasonably  recommends that 24-hour protection is not necessary but that the  employee be provided security at his workplace and for ground  transportation, but not for air transportation. If company Z follows the  recommendations on a consistent basis, an overall security program will  be deemed to exist with respect to the workplace and ground  transportation security only.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Assume the same facts as in example (4) except that  company Z only provides the employee security while commuting to and  from work, but not for any other ground transportation. Because the  recommendations of the independent security study are not applied on a  consistent basis, an overall security program will not be deemed to  exist. Thus, the value of commuting to and from work is not excludable  from income. However, the value of a bodyguard with professional  security training who does not provide chauffeur or other personal  services to the employee or any member of the employee's family may be  excludable as a working condition fringe if such expense would be  otherwise allowable as a deduction by the employee under section 162 or  167.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. J is a United States District Judge. At the beginning of  a 3-month criminal trial in J's court, a member of J's family receives  death threats. M, the division (within government agency W) responsible  for evaluating threats and providing protective services to the Federal  judiciary, directs its threat analysis unit to conduct a security study  with respect to J and J's family. The study is conducted pursuant to  internal written procedures that require an independent and objective  assessment of any threats to members of the Federal judiciary and their  families, a statement of the requisite security response, if any, to a  particular threat (including the form of transportation to be furnished  to the employee as part of the security program), and a description of  the circumstances under which local transportation for the employee and  the employee's spouse and dependents may be necessary for personal  reasons during the time protective services are provided. M's study  concludes that a bona fide business-oriented security concern exists  with respect to J and J's family and determines that 24-hour protection  of J and J's family is not necessary, but that protection is necessary  during the course of the criminal trial whenever J or J's family is away  from home. Consistent with that recommendation, J is transported every  day in a government vehicle for both personal and business reasons and  is accompanied by two bodyguard/chauffeurs who have been trained in  evasive driving techniques. In addition, J's spouse is driven to and  from work and J's children are driven to and from school and occasional  school activities. Shortly after the trial is concluded, M's threat  analysis unit determines that J and J's family no longer need special  protection because the danger posed by the threat no longer exists and,  accordingly, vehicle transportation is no longer provided. Because the  security study conducted by M complies with the conditions of Sec.  1.132-5(m)(2)(v), M has satisfied the requirement for an independent  security study and an overall security program with   respect to J is deemed to exist. Thus, with respect to the  transportation provided for security concerns, J may exclude as a  working condition fringe the value of any special security features of  the government vehicle and the value attributable to the two bodyguard/ chauffeurs. See Example (1) of this paragraph (m)(8). The value of  vehicle transportation provided to J and J's family for personal  reasons, other than commuting, may also be excluded during the period of  protection, because its provision was consistent with the recommendation  of the security study.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Assume the same facts as in Example (6) and that J's one- way commute between home and work is 10 miles. Under paragraph (m)(6) of  this section, the Federal Government may value transportation provided  to J for commuting purposes pursuant to the value set forth in either  the vehicle cents-per-mile rule of Sec. 1.61-21(e) or the commuting  valuation rule of Sec. 1.61-21(f). Because the commuting valuation rule  yields the least amount of taxable income to J under the circumstances,  W values the transportation provided to J for commuting at $1.50 per  one-way commute, even though J is a control employee within the meaning  of Sec. 1.61-21(f)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Product testing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The fair market value of the  use of consumer goods, which are manufactured for sale to nonemployees,  for product testing and evaluation by an employee of the manufacturer  outside the employer's workplace, is excludible from gross income as a  working condition fringe if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consumer testing and evaluation of the product is an ordinary  and necessary business expense of the employer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Business reasons necessitate that the testing and evaluation of  the product be performed off the employer's business premises by  employees (i.e., the testing and evaluation cannot be carried out  adequately in the employer's office or in laboratory testing  facilities);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The product is furnished to the employee for purposes of  testing and evaluation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The product is made available to the employee for no longer  than necessary to test and evaluate its performance and (to the extent  not exhausted) must be returned to the employer at completion of the  testing and evaluation period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The employer imposes limits on the employee's use of the product  that significantly reduce the value of any personal benefit to the  employee; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The employee must submit detailed reports to the employer on  the testing and evaluation. The length of the testing and evaluation  period must be reasonable in relation to the product being tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Employer-imposed limits. The requirement of paragraph (n)(1)(v)  of this section is satisfied if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The employer places limits on the employee's ability to select  among different models or varieties of the consumer product that is  furnished for testing and evaluation purposes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The employer generally prohibits use of the product by persons  other than the employee and, in appropriate cases, requires the  employee, to purchase or lease at the employee's own expense the same  type of product as that being tested (so that personal use by the  employee's family will be limited). In addition, any charge by the  employer for the personal use by an employee of a product being tested  shall be taken into account in determining whether the requirement of  paragraph (n)(1)(v) of this section is satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Discriminating classifications. If an employer furnishes  products under a testing and evaluation program only, or presumably, to  certain classes of employees (such as highly compensated employees, as  defined in Sec. 1.132-8(g)), this fact may be relevant when determining  whether the products are furnished for testing and evaluation purposes  or for compensation purposes, unless the employer can show a business  reason for the classification of employees to whom the products are  furnished (e.g., that automobiles are furnished for testing and  evaluation by an automobile manufacturer to its design engineers and  supervisory mechanics).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Factors that negate the existence of a product testing program.  If an employer fails to tabulate and examine the results of the detailed  reports submitted by employees within a reasonable period of time after  expiration of the testing period, the program will not be considered a  product testing   program for purposes of the exclusion of this paragraph (n). Existence  of one or more of the following factors may also establish that the  program is not a bona fide product testing program for purposes of the  exclusion of this paragraph (n):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The program is in essence a leasing program under which  employees lease the consumer goods from the employer for a fee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The nature of the product and other considerations are  insufficient to justify the testing program; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The expense of the program outweighs the benefits to be gained  from testing and evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Failure to meet the requirements of this paragraph (n). The fair  market value of the use of property for product testing and evaluation  by an employee outside the employee's workplace, under a product testing  program that does not meet all of the requirements of this paragraph  (n), is not excludable from gross income as a working condition fringe  under this paragraph (n).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Example. The rules of this paragraph (n) may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Assume that an employer that manufactures automobiles  establishes a product testing program under which 50 of its 5,000  employees test and evaluate the automobiles for 30 days. Assume further  that the 50 employees represent a fair cross-section of all of the  employees of the employer, such employees submit detailed reports to the  employer on the testing and evaluation, the employer tabulates and  examines the test results within a reasonable time, and the use of the  automobiles is restricted to the employees. If the employer imposes the  limits described in paragraph (n)(2) of this section, the employees may  exclude the value of the use of the automobile during the testing and  evaluation period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Qualified automobile demonstration use--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  value of qualified automobile demonstration use is excludable from gross  income as a working condition fringe. ``Qualified automobile  demonstration use'' is any use of a demonstration automobile by a full- time automobile salesman in the sales area in which the automobile  dealer's sales office is located if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such use is provided primarily to facilitate the salesman's  performance of services for the employer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There are substantial restrictions on the personal use of the  automobile by the salesman.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Full-time automobile salesman--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Defined. The term ``full-time  automobile salesman'' means any individual who--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is employed by an automobile dealer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Customarily spends at least half of a normal business day  performing the functions of a floor salesperson or sales manager;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Directly engages in substantial promotion and negotiation of  sales to customers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Customarily works a number of hours considered full-time in the  industry (but at a rate not less than 1,000 hours per year); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> of this section, income is not  considered to be derived directly as a result of activities described in  paragraphs (o)(2)(i) (B) and (C) of this section to the extent that the  income is attributable to an individual's ownership interest in the  dealership. An individual will not be considered to engage in direct  sales activities if the individual's sales-related activities are  substantially limited to review of sales price offers from customers. An  individual, such as the general manager of an automobi1e dealership, who  receives a sales commission on the sale of an automobile is not a full- time automobile salesman unless the requirements of this paragraph  (o)(2)(i) are met. The exclusion provided in this paragraph (o) is  available to an individual who meets the definition of this paragraph  (o)(2)(i) whether the individual performs services in addition to those  described in this paragraph (o)(2)(i). For example, an individual who is  an owner of the automobile dealership but who otherwise meets the  requirements of this paragraph (o)(2)(i) may exclude from gross income  the value of qualified automobile demonstration use. However, the  exclusion of this paragraph (o) is not available to   owners of large automobile dealerships who do not customarily engage in  significant sales activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use by an individual other than a full-time automobile  salesman. Personal use of a demonstration automobile by an individual  other than a full-time automobile salesman is not treated as a working  condition fringe. Therefore, any personal use, including commuting use,  of a demonstration automobile by a part-time salesman, automobile  mechanic, or other individual who is not a full-time automobile salesman  is not ``qualified automobile demonstration use'' and thus not  excludable from gross income. This is the case whether or not the  personal use is within the sales area (as defined in paragraph (o)(5) of  this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Demonstration automobile. The exclusion provided in this  paragraph (o) applies only to qualified use of a demonstration  automobile. A demonstration automobile is an automobile that is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Currently in the inventory of the automobile dealership; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Available for test drives by customers during the normal  business hours of the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Substantial restrictions on personal use. Substantial  restrictions on the personal use of a demonstration automobile exist  when all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use by individuals other than the full-time automobile salesmen  (e.g., the salesman's family) is prohibited;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use for personal vacation trips is prohibited;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The storage of personal possessions in the automobile is  prohibited; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The total use by mileage of the automobile by the salesman  outside the salesman's normal working hours is limited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Sales area--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Qualified automobile demonstration  use consists of use in the sales area in which the automobile dealer's  sales office is located. The sales area is the geographic area  surrounding the automobile dealer's sales office from which the office  regularly derives customers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sales area safe harbor. With respect to a particular full-time  salesman, the automobile dealer's sales area may be treated as the area  within a radius of the larger of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 75 miles or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The one-way commuting distance (in miles) of the particular  salesman from the dealer's sales office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Applicability of substantiation requirements of sections 162 and  274(d). Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the  value of the use of a demonstration automobile may not be excluded from  gross income as a working condition fringe, by either the employer or  the employee, unless, with respect to the restrictions of paragraph  (o)(4) of this section, the substantiation requirements of section  274(d) and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. See Sec. 1.132- 5(c) for general and safe harbor rules relating to the applicability of  the substantiation requirements of section 274(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Special valuation rules. See Sec. 1.61-21(d)(6)(ii) for special  rules that may be used to value the availability of demonstration  automobiles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Parking--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The value of parking provided to an  employee on or near the business premises of the employer is excludable  from gross income as a working condition fringe under the special rule  of this paragraph (p). If the rules of this paragraph (p) are satisfied,  the value of parking is excludable from gross income whether the amount  paid by the employee for parking would be deductible under section 162.  The working condition fringe exclusion applies whether the employer owns  or rents the parking facility or parking space.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reimbursement of parking expenses. A reimbursement to the  employee of the ordinary and necessary expenses of renting a parking  space on or near the business premises of the employer is excludable  from gross income as a working condition fringe, if, but for the parking  expense, the employee would not have been entitled to receive and retain  such amount from the employer. If, however an employee is entitled to  retain a general transportation allowance or a similar benefit whether  or not the employee has parking expenses, no portion of that allowance  is excludable from gross income under this paragraph (p) even if it is  used for parking expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Parking on residential property. With respect to an employee,  this paragraph (p) does not apply to any parking facility or space  located on property owned or leased by the employee for residential  purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Dates of applicability. This paragraph (p) applies to benefits  provided before January 1, 1993. For benefits provided after December  31, 1992, see Sec. 1.132-9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Nonapplicability of nondiscrimination rules. Except to the  extent provided in paragraph (n)(3) of this section (relating to  discriminating classifications of a product testing program), the  nondiscrimination rules of section 132 (h)(1) and Sec. 1.132-8 do not  apply in determining the amount, if any, of a working condition fringe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> Volunteers--(1) In general. Solely for purposes of section  132(d) and paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section, a bona fide volunteer  (including a director or officer) who performs services for an  organization exempt from tax under section 501(a), or for a government  employer (as defined in paragraph (m)(7) of this section), is deemed to  have a profit motive under section 162.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limit on application of this paragraph. This paragraph (r) shall  not be used to support treatment of the bona fide volunteer as having a  profit motive for purposes of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code  of 1986 (Code) other than section 132(d). Nothing in this paragraph (r)  shall be interpreted as determining the employment status of a bona fide  volunteer for purposes of any section of the Code other than section  132(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Bona fide volunteer. For purposes of this  paragraph (r), an individual is considered a ``bona fide volunteer'' if  the individual does not have a profit motive for purposes of section  162. For example, an individual is considered a ``bona fide volunteer''  if the total value of the benefits provided with respect to the  volunteer services is substantially less than the total value of the  volunteer services the individual provides to an exempt organization or  government employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Liability insurance coverage for a bona fide volunteer. For  purposes of this paragraph (r), the receipt of liability insurance  coverage by a volunteer, or an exempt organization or government  employer's undertaking to indemnify the volunteer for liability, does  not by itself confer a profit motive on the volunteer, provided the  insurance coverage or indemnification relates to acts performed by the  volunteer in the discharge of duties, or the performance of services, on  behalf of the exempt organization or government employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  paragraph (r) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example. A is a manager and full-time employee of P, a tax-exempt  organization described in section 501(c)(3). B is a member of P's board  of directors. Other than $25 to defray expenses for attending board  meetings, B receives no compensation for serving as a director and does  not have a profit motive. Therefore, B is a bona fide volunteer by  application of paragraph (r)(3)(i) of this section and is deemed to have  a profit motive under paragraph (r)(1) of this section for purposes of  section 132(d). In order to provide liability insurance coverage, P  purchases a policy that covers actions arising from A's and B's  activities performed as part of their duties to P. The value of the  policy and payments made to or on behalf of A under the policy are  excludable for A's gross income as a working condition fringe, because A  has a profit motive under section 162 and would be able to deduct  payments for liability insurance coverage had he paid for it himself.  The receipt of liability insurance coverage by B does not confer a  profit motive on B by application of paragraph (r)(3)(ii) of this  section. Thus, the value of the policy and payments made to or on behalf  of B under the policy are excludable from B's income as a working  condition fringe. For the year in which the liability insurance coverage  is provided to A and B, P may exclude the value of the benefit on the  Form W-2 it issues to A or on any Form 1099 it might otherwise issue to  B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(s)</em> Application of section 274(a)(3)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If an  employer's deduction under section 162(a) for dues paid or incurred for  membership in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or  other social purpose is disallowed by section 274(a)(3), the amount, if  any, of an employee's working condition fringe benefit relating to an  employer-provided membership in the club is determined without regard to  the application of section 274(a) to the employee. To be excludible as a   working condition fringe benefit, however, the amount must otherwise  qualify for deduction by the employee under section 162(a). If an  employer treats the amount paid or incurred for membership in any club  organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose as  compensation under section 274(e)(2), then the expense is deductible by  the employer as compensation and no amount may be excluded from the  employee's gross income as a working condition fringe benefit. See Sec.  1.274-2(f)(2)(iii)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of tax-exempt employers. In the case of an employer  exempt from taxation under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, any  reference in this paragraph (s) to a deduction disallowed by section  274(a)(3) shall be treated as a reference to the amount which would be  disallowed as a deduction by section 274(a)(3) to the employer if the  employer were not exempt from taxation under subtitle A of the Internal  Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (s):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that Company X provides Employee B with a country  club membership for which it paid $20,000. B substantiates, within the  meaning of paragraph (c) of this section, that the club was used 40  percent for business purposes. The business use of the club (40 percent)  may be considered a working condition fringe benefit, notwithstanding  that the employer's deduction for the dues allocable to the business use  is disallowed by section 274(a)(3), if X does not treat the club  membership as compensation under section 274(e)(2). Thus, B may exclude  from gross income $8,000 (40 percent of the club dues, which reflects  B's business use). X must report $12,000 as wages subject to withholding  and payment of employment taxes (60 percent of the value of the club  dues, which reflects B's personal use). B must include $12,000 in gross  income. X may deduct as compensation the amount it paid for the club  dues which reflects B's personal use provided the amount satisfies the  other requirements for a salary or compensation deduction under section  162.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as Example 1 except that Company X  treats the $20,000 as compensation to B under section 274(e)(2). No  portion of the $20,000 will be considered a working condition fringe  benefit because the section 274(a)(3) disallowance will apply to B.  Therefore, B must include $20,000 in gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(t)</em> Application of section 274(m)(3)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If an  employer's deduction under section 162(a) for amounts paid or incurred  for the travel expenses of a spouse, dependent, or other individual  accompanying an employee is disallowed by section 274(m)(3), the amount,  if any, of the employee's working condition fringe benefit relating to  the employer-provided travel is determined without regard to the  application of section 274(m)(3). To be excludible as a working  condition fringe benefit, however, the amount must otherwise qualify for  deduction by the employee under section 162(a). The amount will qualify  for deduction and for exclusion as a working condition fringe benefit if  it can be adequately shown that the spouse's, dependent's, or other  accompanying individual's presence on the employee's business trip has a  bona fide business purpose and if the employee substantiates the travel  within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section. If the travel does  not qualify as a working condition fringe benefit, the employee must  include in gross income as a fringe benefit the value of the employer's  payment of travel expenses with respect to a spouse, dependent, or other  individual accompanying the employee on business travel. See Sec. Sec.  1.61-21(a)(4) and 1.162-2(c). If an employer treats as compensation  under section 274(e)(2) the amount paid or incurred for the travel  expenses of a spouse, dependent, or other individual accompanying an  employee, then the expense is deductible by the employer as compensation  and no amount may be excluded from the employee's gross income as a  working condition fringe benefit.

Gross income does not include the  value of a working condition fringe. The term ``working condition  fringe'' means any property or service provided to an employee of an  employer to the extent that, if the employee paid for the property or  service, the amount paid would be allowable as a deduction under section  162 or 167. If, under section 274 or any other section, certain  substantiation requirements must be met in order for a deduction under  section 162 or 167 to be allowable, those substantiation requirements  apply to the determination of a working condition fringe. An amount that  would be deductible by the employee under, for example, section 212 is  not a working condition fringe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Trade or business of the employee. If the hypothetical payment  for the property or service would be allowable as a deduction with  respect to a trade or business of the employee other than the employee's  trade or business of being an employee of the employer, it cannot be  taken into account for purposes of determining the amount, if any, of  the working condition fringe. For example, assume that, unrelated to  company X's trade or business and unrelated to company X's employee's  trade or business of being an employee of company X, the employee is a  member of the board of directors of company Y. Assume further that  company X provides the employee with air transportation to a company Y  board of director's meeting. The employee may not exclude the value of  the air transportation to the meeting as a working condition fringe. The  employee may, however, deduct such amount under section 162 if the  section 162 requirements are satisfied. The result would be the same  whether the air transportation was provided in the form of a flight on a  commercial airline or a seat on a company X airplane.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Vehicle allocation rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. In  general, with respect to an employer-provided vehicle, the amount  excludable as a working condition fringe is the amount that would be  allowable as a deduction under section 162 or 167 if the employee paid  for the availability of the vehicle. For example, assume that the value  of the availability of an employer-provided vehicle for a full year is  $2,000, without regard to any working condition fringe (i.e., assuming  all personal use). Assume further that the employee drives the vehicle  6,000 miles for his employer's business and 2,000 miles for reasons  other than the employer's business. In this situation, the value of the  working condition fringe is $2,000 multiplied by a fraction, the  numerator of which is the business-use mileage (6,000 miles) and the  denominator of which is the total mileage (8,000 miles). Thus, the value  of the working condition fringe is $1,500. The total amount includable  in the employee's gross income on account of the availability of the  vehicle is $500. For purposes of this section, the term ``vehicle'' has  the same meaning given the term in Sec. 1.61-2T(e)(2). Generally, when  determining the amount of an employee's working condition fringe, miles  accumulated on the vehicle by all employees of the employer during the  period in which the vehicle is available to the employee must be  considered. For example, assume that an employee of the employer is  provided the availability of an automobile for one year. Assume further  that during the year, the automobile is regularly used in the employer's  business by other employees. All miles accumulated on the automobile by  all employees of the employer during the year must be considered. If,  however, substantially all the use of the automobile by other employees  in the employer's business is permitted during a certain period, such as  the last three months of the year, the miles driven by the other  employees during that period would not be considered when determining  the employee's working condition fringe exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use by an individual other than the employee. For purposes of  this section,   if the availability of a vehicle to an individual would be taxed to an  employee, use of the vehicle by the individual is included in references  to use by the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Provision of an expensive vehicle for personal use. Assume an  employer provides an employee with an expensive vehicle that an employee  may use in part for personal purposes. Even though the decision to  provide an expensive rather than an inexpensive vehicle is made by the  employer for bona fide noncompensatory business reasons, there is no  working condition fringe exclusion with respect to the personal miles  driven by the employee. If the employee paid for the availability of the  vehicle, he would not be entitled to deduct any part of the payment  attributable to personal miles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use of different employer-provided automobiles. The working  condition fringe exclusion must be applied on an automobile by  automobile basis. For example, assume that automobile Y is available to  employee D for 3 days in January and for 5 days in March, and automobile  Z is available to D for a week in July. Assume further that the Daily  Lease Value, as defined in Sec. 1.61-2T, of each automobile is $50. For  the eight days of availability of Y in January and March, D uses Y 90  percent for business (by mileage). During July, D uses Z 60 percent for  business (by mileage). The value of the working condition fringe is  determined separately for each automobile. Therefore, the working  condition fringe for Y is $360 ($400 x .90) leaving an income inclusion  of $40. The working condition fringe for Z is $210 ($350 x .60) leaving  an income inclusion of $140. If the value of the availability of an  automobile is determined under the Annual Lease Value rule for one  period and Daily Lease Value rule for a second period (see Sec. 1.61- 2T), the working condition fringe exclusion must be calculated  separately for the two periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicability of sections 162 and 274(d)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  value of property or services provided to an employee may not be  excluded from the employee's gross income as a working condition fringe,  by either the employer or the employee, unless the applicable  substantiation requirements of either section 274(d) or section 162  (whichever is applicable) and the regulations thereunder are statisfied.  With respect to listed property, the substantiation requirements of  section 274(d) and the regulations thereunder do not apply to the  determination of an employee's working condition fringe exclusion prior  to the date that those requirements apply to the first taxable year of  the employer beginning after December 31, 1985. For example, if an  employer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1985, begins  on July 1, 1986, with respect to listed property, the substantiation  requirements of section 274(d) apply as of that date. The substantiation  requirements of section 274(d) apply to an employee even if the  requirements of section 274 do not apply to the employee's employer for  deduction purposes (such as when the employer is a tax-exempt  organization or a governmental unit); in these cases, the requirements  of section 274(d) apply to the employee as of January 1, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 274(d) requirements. The substantiation requirements of  section 274(d) are satisfied by ``adequate records or sufficient  evidence corroborating the [employee's] own statement''. Therefore, such  records or evidence provided by the employee, and relied upon by the  employer to the extent permitted by the regulations promulgated under  section 274(d), will be sufficient to substantiate a working condition  fringe exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Safe harbor rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 1.274-6T provides  that the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and the  regulations thereunder may be satisfied, in certain circumstances, by  using one or more of the safe harbor rules prescribed in Sec. 1.274-6T.  If the employer uses one of the safe harbor rules prescribed in Sec.  1.274-6T during a period with respect to a vehicle (as defined in Sec.  1.61-2T), that rule must be used by the employer to substantiate a  working condition fringe exclusion with respect to that vehicle during  the period. An employer that is exempt from Federal income tax may still  use one of the safe harbor rules (if the requirements of that section  are otherwise met during a period) to substantiate a working condition   fringe exclusion with respect to a vehicle during the period. If the  employer uses one of the methods prescribed in Sec. 1.274-6T during a  period with respect to an employer-provided vehicle, that method may be  used by an employee to substantiate a working condition fringe exclusion  with respect to the same vehicle during the period, as long as the  employee includes in gross income the amount allocated to the employee  pursuant to Sec. 1.274-6T and this section. (See Sec. 1.61-2T(c)(2)(i)  for other rules concerning when an employee must include in income the  amount determined by the employer.) If, however, the employer uses the  safe harbor rule prescribed in Sec. 1.274-6T(a) (2) or (3) and the  employee without the employer's knowledge uses the vehicle for purposes  other than de minimis personal use (in the case of the rule prescribed  in Sec. 1.274-6T(a)(2)), or for purposes other than de minimis personal  use and commuting (in the case of the rule prescribed in Sec. 1.274- 6T(a)(3)), then the employee must include additional income for the  unauthorized use of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Period for use of safe harbor rules. The rules prescribed in  this paragraph (d) assume that the safe harbor rules prescribed in Sec.  1.274-6T are used for a one-year period. Accordingly, references to the  value of the availability of a vehicle, amounts excluded as a working  condition fringe, etc., are based on a one-year period. If the safe  harbor rules prescribed in Sec. 1.274-6T are used for a period of less  than a year, the amounts referenced in the previous sentence must be  adjusted accordingly. For purposes of this section, the term ``personal  use'' has the same meaning as prescribed in Sec. 1.274-6T(e)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Vehicles not available to employees for personal use. For a  vehicle described in Sec. 1.274-6T(a)(2) (relating to certain vehicles  not used for personal purposes), the working condition fringe exclusion  is equal to the value of the availability of the vehicle if the employer  uses the method prescribed in Sec. 1.274-6T(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Vehicles not available to employees for personal use other than  commuting. For a vehicle described in Sec. 1.274-6T(a)(3) (relating to  certain vehicles not used for personal purposes other than commuting),  the working condition fringe exclusion is equal to the value of the  availability of the vehicle for purposes other than commuting if the  employer uses the method prescribed in Sec. 1.274-6T(a)(3). This rule  applies only if the special rule for valuing commuting use, as  prescribed in Sec. 1.61-2T, is used and the amount determined under the  special rule is either included in the employee's income or reimbursed  by the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Vehicles used in connection with the business of farming that  are available to employees for personal use--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For a  vehicle described in Sec. 1.274-6T(b) (relating to certain vehicles  used in connection with the business of farming), the working condition  fringe exclusion is calculated by multiplying the value of the  availability of the vehicle by 75 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Vehicles available to more than one individual. If the vehicle  is available to more than one individual, the employer must allocate the  gross income attributable to the vehicle (25 percent of the value of the  availability of the vehicle) among the employees (and other individuals  whose use would not be attributed to an employee) to whom the vehicle  was available. This allocation must be done in a reasonable manner to  reflect the personal use of the vehicle by the individuals. An amount  that would be allocated to a sole proprietor reduces the amounts that  may be allocated to employees but are otherwise to be disregarded for  purposes of this paragraph (g). For purposes of this paragraph (g), the  value of the availability of a vehicle may be calculated as if the  vehicle were available to only one employee continuously and without  regard to any working condition fringe exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate a reasonable  allocation of gross income with respect to an employer-provided vehicle  between two employees:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that two farm employees share the use of a vehicle  which for a calendar year is regularly used directly in connection with  the business of farming and qualifies for use of the rule in Sec.  1.274-6T (b). Employee A uses the vehicle in the morning directly in  connection with the business of farming and employee B uses the vehicle  in the afternoon directly in connection with the business of farming.  Assume further that   employee B takes the vehicle home in the evenings and on weekends. The  employer should allocate all the income attributable to the availability  of the vehicle to employee B.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that for a calendar year, farm employees C and D  share the use of a vehicle that is regularly used directly in connection  with the business of farming and qualifies for use of the rule in Sec.  1.274-6T (b). Assume further that the employees alternate taking the  vehicle home in the evening and alternate the availability of the  vehicle for personal purposes on weekends. The employer should allocate  the income attributable to the availability of the vehicle for personal  use (25 percent of the value of the availability of the vehicle) equally  between the two employees.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that C is  the sole proprietor of the farm. Based on these facts, C should allocate  the same amount of income to D as was allocated to D in example (2). No  other income attributable to the availability of the vehicle for  personal use should be allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Qualified non-personal use vehicles. Effective January 1, 1985,  100 percent of the value of the use of a qualified nonpersonal use  vehicle (as described in Sec. 1.274-5T (k)) is excluded from gross  income as a working condition fringe, provided that, in the case of a  vehicle described in paragraph (k) (3) through (7) of that section, the  use of the vehicles conforms to the requirements of that paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> does not affect  the applicability of section 280F to the employer with respect to such  employer-provided automobile, nor does it affect the applicability of  section 274. For rules concerning substantiation of an employee's  working condition fringe, see paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Aircraft allocation rule. In general, with respect to a flight  on an employer-provided aircraft, the amount excludable as a working  condition fringe is the amount that would be allowable as a deduction  under section 162 or 167 if the employee paid for the flight on the  aircraft. For example, if employee P flies on P's employer's airplane  primarily for business reasons of P's employer, the value of P's flight  is excludable as a working condition fringe. However, if P's spouse and  children accompany P on such airplane trip primarily for personal  reasons, the value of the flights by P's spouse and children are  includable in P's gross income. See Sec. 1.61-2T(g) for special rules  for valuing personal flights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Employer-provided transportation for security concerns--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. The amount of a working condition fringe exclusion with respect  to employer-provided transportation is the amount that would be  allowable as a deduction under section 162 or 167 if the employee paid  for the transportation. Generally, if an employee pays for  transportation taken for primarily personal purposes, the employee may  not deduct any part of the amount paid. Thus, the employee may not  generally exclude the value of employer-provided transportation as a  working condition fringe if such transportation is primarily personal.  If, however, for bona fide business-oriented security concerns, the  employee purchases transportation that provides him or her with  additional security, the employee may generally deduct the excess of the  amount paid for the transportation over the lesser amount the employee  would have paid for the same mode of transportation absent the bona fide  business-oriented security concerns. With respect to a vehicle, the  phrase ``the same mode of transportation'' means use of the same vehicle  without the additional security aspects, such as bulletproof glass. With  respect to air transportation, the phrase ``the same   mode of transportation'' means comparable air transportation. These same  rules apply to the determination of an employee's working condition  fringe exclusion. For example, if an employer provides an employee with  an automobile for commuting and, for bona fide business-oriented  security concerns, the automobile is specially designed for security,  then the employee may exclude the value of the special security design  as a working condition fringe if the employee's automobile would not  have had such security design but for the bona fide business-oriented  security concerns. The employee may not exclude the value of the  commuting from income as a working condition fringe because commuting is  a nondeductible personal expense. Similarly, if an employee travels on a  personal trip in an employer-provided aircraft for bona fide business- oriented security concerns, the employee may exclude the excess, if any,  of the value of the flight over the amount the employee would have paid  for comparable air transportation, but for the bona fide business- oriented security concerns. Because personal travel is a nondeductible  expense, the employee may not exclude the total value of the trip as a  working condition fringe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Demonstration of bona fide business-oriented security concerns-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this paragraph (m), the existence of a  bona fide business-oriented security concern for the furnishing of a  specific form of transportation to an employee is determined on the  basis of all the facts and circumstances within the following  guidelines:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Services performed outside the United States. With respect to an  employee performing services for an employer in a geographic area other  than the United States, a factor indicating a bona fide business- oriented security concern is a recent history of violent terrorist  activity in such geographic area (such as bombings or abductions for  ransom), unless such activity is focused on a group of individuals which  does not include the employee or a similarly situated employee or on a  section of the geographic area which does not incude the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Services performed in the United States. With respect to an  employee performing services for an employer in the United States, a  factor indicating a bona fide business-oriented security concern is  threats on the life of the employee or on the life of a similarly  situated employee because of the employee's status as an employee of the  employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Establishment of overall security program. Notwithstanding  anything in paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section to the contrary, no bona  fide business-oriented security concern will be deemed to exist unless  the employee's employer establishes an overall security program with  respect to the employee involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Overall security program--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Definition. An overall security  program is one in which security is provided to protect the employee on  a 24-hour basis. The employee must be protected while at the employee's  residence, while commuting to and from the employee's workplace, and  while at the employee's workplace. In addition, the employee must be  protected while traveling, whether for business or personal purposes. An  overall security program would include the provision of a bodyguard/ driver who is trained in evasive driving techniques; and automobile  specially equipped for security; guards, metal detectors, alarms, or  similar methods of controling access to the employee's workplace and  residence; and, in appropriate cases, flights on the employer's aircraft  for business and personal reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Application. There is no overall security program when, for  example, security is provided at the employee's workplace but not at the  employee's residence. In addition, the fact that an employer requires an  employee to travel on the employer's aircraft, or in an employer- provided vehicle that contains special security features, does not alone  constitute an overall security program. The preceding sentence applies  regardless of the existence of a corporate or other resolution requiring  the employee to travel in the employer's airplane or vehicle for  personal as well as business reasons. Similarly, the existence of an  independent security study particular to the employer and   its employees, or to the employee involved, does not alone constitute an  overall security program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A security study is performed with respect to the employer and  the employee (or a similarly situated employee) by an independent  security consultant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The security study is based on an objective assessment of all  the facts and circumstances;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The recommendation of the security study is that an overall  security program (as defined in paragraph (m)(2)(iii) of this section)  is not necessary and such recommendation is reasonable under the  circumstances; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The employer applies the specific security recommendations  contained in the security study to the employee on a consistent basis.  The value of the security provided pursuant to a security study that  meets the requirements of this paragraph (m)(2)(iv) may be excluded from  income, if the security study conclusions are reasonable and, but for  the bona fide business-oriented security concerns, the employee would  not have had such security. No exclusion from income applies to security  provided by the employer that is not recommended in the security study.  Security study conclusions may be reasonable even if, for example, it is  recommended that security be limited to certain geographic areas, as in  the case where air travel security is provided only in certain foreign  countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Application of security rules to spouses and dependents. The  availability of a working condition fringe exclusion based on the  existence of a bona fide business-oriented security concern with respect  to the spouse and dependents of an employee is determined separately for  such spouse and dependents under the rules established in this paragraph  (m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em>, if, for a bona fide business-oriented security  concern, the employer requires that the employee travel on an employer- provided aircraft for a personal trip, the employer and the employee may  exclude, as a working condition fringe, the excess value of the trip  over comparable first-class airfare without having to show that but for  the bona fide business-oriented security concerns, the employee would  have flown first-class on a commercial aircraft. If the special  valuation rule provided in Sec. 1.61-2T is used, the excess over the  amount determined by multiplying an aircraft multiple of 200-percent by  the base aircraft valuation formula may be excluded as a working  condition fringe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (m) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that in response to several death threats on the  life of A, the president of a multinational company (company X), company  X establishes an overall security program for A, including an alarm  system at A's home and guards at A's workplace, the use of a vehicle  that is specially equipped with alarms, bulletproof glass, and armor  plating and a bodyguard/driver who is trained in evasive driving  techniques. Assume further that A is driven for both personal and  business reasons in the vehicle. Also, assume that but for the bona fide  business-oriented security concerns, no part of the overall suecurity  program would been provided to A. With respect to the transportation  provided for security reasons, A may exclude as a working condition  fringe the value of the special security features of the vehicle and the  value attributable to the bodyguard/driver. Thus, if the value of the  specially equipped vehicle is $40,000, and the value of the vehicle  without the security features is $25,000, A may determine A's income  attributable to the vehicle as if the vehicle were worth $25,000. A must  include in income the value of the availability of the vehicle for  personal use.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that B is the chief executive officer of a  multinational corporation (company Y). Assume further that there have  been kidnapping attempts and other terrorist activities in the foreign  countries in which B performs services and that at least some of such  activities have been directed against B or similarly situated employees.  In response to these activities, company Y provides B with an overall  security program, including an alarm system at B's home and bodyguards  at B's workplace, a bodyguard/driver who is trained in evasive   driving techniques, and a vehicle specially designed for security during  B's overseas travels. In addition, assume that company Y requires B to  travel in company Y's airplane for business and personal trips taken to,  from, and within these foreign countries. Also, assume that but for bona  fide business-oriented security concerns, no part of the overall  sucurity program would have been provided to B. B may exclude as a  working condition fringe the value of the special security features of  the automobile and the value attributable to the bodyguards and the  bodyguard/driver. B may also exclude as a working condition fringe the  excess, if any, of the value of personal flights in the company Y  airplane over first-class airfare (as determined under the special  valuation rule provided in Sec. 1.61-2T if the safe harbor described in  paragraph (m)(2)(vi) of this section is used). B must include in income  the value of the availability of the vehicle for personal use and the  lesser of the value of first-class airfare or the value of the flight  determined under Sec. 1.61-2T for each personal flight taken by B in  company Y's airplane.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that  company Y also requires B to travel in company Y's airplane within the  United States, and provides B with a chauffeur-driven limousine for  business and personal travel in the United States. Assume further that  company Y also requires B's spouse and dependents to travel in company  Y's airplane for personal flights in the United States. If no bona fide  business-oriented security concern exists with respect to travel in the  United States, B may not exclude any portion of the value of the  availability of the driver or limousine for personal use in the United  States. Thus, B must include in income the value of the availability of  the vehicle and driver for personal use. In addition, B may not exclude  any portion of the value attributable to personal flights by B or B's  spouse and dependents on company Y's airplane. Thus, B must include in  income the value attributable to the personal use of company Y's  airplane. See Sec. 1.61-2T for rules relating to the valuation of  personal flights on employer-provided airplanes.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume that company Z retains an independent security  consultant to perform a security study with respect to its chief  executive officer. Assume further that, based on an objective assessment  of the facts and circumstances, the security consultant reasonably  recommends that the employee be provided security at his workplace and  for ground transportation, but not for air transportation. If company Z  follows the recommendations on a consistent basis, an overall security  program will be deemed to exist with respect to the workplace and ground  transportation security only.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Assume the same facts as in example (4) except that  company Z only provides the employee security while commuting to and  from work, but not for any other ground transportation. Since the  recommendations of the independent security study are not applied on a  consistent basis, an overall security program will not be deemed to  exist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Product testing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The fair market value of the  use of consumer goods, which are manufactured for sale to nonemployees,  for product testing and evaluation by an employee outside the employer's  workplace is excludable as a working condition fringe if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consumer testing and evaluation of the product is an ordinary  and necessary business expense of the employer,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Business reasons necessitate that the testing and evaluation of  the product be performed off the employer's business premises by  employees (i.e., the testing and evaluation cannot be carried out  adequately in the employer's office or in laboratory testing  facilities),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The product is furnished to the employee for purposes of  testing and evaluation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The product is made available to the employee for no longer  than necessary to test and evaluate its performance and must be returned  to the employer at completion of the testing and evaluation period,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The employer imposes limitations of the employee's use of the  product which significantly reduce the value of any personal benefit to  the employee, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The employee must submit detailed reports to the employer on  the testing and evaluation.  The length of the testing and evaluation period must be reasonable in  relation to the product being tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Employer-imposed limitations. The requirement of paragraph  (n)(1)(v) of this section is satisfied if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The employer places limitations on the employee's ability to  select among different models or varieties of the consumer product that  is furnished for testing and evaluation purposes,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The employer's policy provides for the employee, in appropriate  cases, to purchase or lease at his or her own   expense the same type of product as that being tested (so that personal  use by the employee's family will be limited), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The employer generally prohibits use of the product by members  of the employee's family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Discriminating classifications. If an employer furnishes  products under a testing and evaluation program only to officers,  owners, or highly compensated employees, this fact may be considered in  a determination of whether the products are furnished for testing and  evaluation purposes or for compensation purposes, unless the employer  can show a business reason for the classification of employees to whom  the products are furnished (e.g., that automobiles are furnished for  testing and evaluation by an automobile manufacturer to its design  engineers and supervisory mechanics).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Factors that negate the existence of a product testing program.  If an employer fails to tabulate and examine the results of the detailed  reports within a reasonable period of time after expiration of the  testing period, the program will not be considered a product testing  program. Existence of one or more of the following factors may also  establish that the program is not a bona fide product testing program:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The program is in essence a leasing program under which  employees lease the consumer goods from the employer for a fee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The nature of the product and other considerations are  insufficient to justify the testing program; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The expense of the program outweighs the benefits to be gained  from testing and evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Failure to meet the requirements of this paragraph (n). The fair  market value of the use of property for product testing and evaluation  by an employee outside the employee's workplace, under a product testing  program that does not meet all of the requirements of this paragraph  (n), is not excludable as a working condition fringe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Example. Assume that an employer that manufactures automobiles  establishes a product testing program under which 50 of its 5,000  employees test and evaluate the automobiles for 30 days. Assume further  that the 50 employees represent a fair cross section of all of the  employees of the employer, such employees submit detailed reports to the  employer on the testing and evaluation, the employer tabulates and  examines the test results within a reasonable time, and the use of the  automobiles is restricted to the employees. If the rules of paragraph  (n)(2) of this section are also met, the employees may exclude the value  of the use of the automobile during the testing and evaluation period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Qualified automobile demonstration use--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  value of qualified automobile demonstration use is excludable from gross  income as a working condition fringe. The term ``qualified automobile  demonstration use'' means any use of a demonstration automobile by a  full-time automobile salesman in the sales area in which the automobile  dealer's sales office is located if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such use is provided primarily to facilitate the salesman's  performance of services for the employer, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There are substantial restrictions on the personal use of the  automobile by the salesman.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Full-time automobile salesman--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition. The term ``full- time automobile salesman'' means any individual who--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is employed by an automobile dealer,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Customarily spends substantially all of a normal business day on  the sales floor selling automobiles to customers of the automobile  dealership,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Customarily works a number of hours considered full-time in the  industry (but at a rate not less than 1,000 hours per year), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Derives at least 85 percent of his or her gross income from the  automobile dealership directly as a result of such automobile sales  activities.  An individual, such as the general manager of an automobile dealership,  who receives a sales commission on the sale of an automobile is not a  full-time automobile salesman unless the requirements of this paragraph  (o)(2)(i) are met. The exclusion provided in this paragraph (o) is  available to an individual who meets the definition of this paragraph  (o)(2)(i) regardless of whether the individual performs services in   addition to those described in this paragraph (o)(2)(i). For example, an  individual who is an owner of the automobile dealership but who  otherwise meets the requirements of this paragraph (o)(2)(i) may exclude  from gross income the value of qualified automobile demonstration use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use by an individual other than a full-time automobile  salesman. Personal use of a demonstration automobile by an individual  other than a full-time automobile salesman is not treated as a working  condition fringe. Therefore, any personal use, including commuting use,  of a demonstration automobile by a part-time salesman, automobile  mechanic, manager, or other individual is not ``qualified automobile  demonstration use'' and thus not excludable from gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Demonstration automobile. The exclusion provided in this  paragraph (o) applies only to qualified use of a demonstration  automobile. A demonstration automobile is an automobile that is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Currently in the inventory of the automobile dealership, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Available for test drives by customers during the normal  business hours of the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Substantial restrictions on personal use. Substantial  restrictions on the personal use of demonstration automobiles exist when  all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use by individuals other than the full-time automobile salesmen  (e.g., the salesman's family) is prohibited,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use for personal vacation trips is prohibited,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The storage of personal possessions in the automobile is  prohibited, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The total use by mileage of the automobile by the salesman  outside the salesman's normal working hours is limited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Sales area--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Qualified automobile demonstration  use must be use in the sales area in which the automobile dealer's sales  office is located. The sales area is the geographic area surrounding the  automobile dealer's sales office from which the office regularly derives  customers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sales area safe harbor. With respect to a particular full-time  salesman, the automobile dealer's sales area may be treated as the  larger of the area within a 75 mile radius of the dealer's sales office,  or the on-way commuting distance (in miles) of the particular salesman.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Parking--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The value of parking provided to an  employee on or near the business premises of the employer is excludable  from gross income as a working condition fringe. The working condition  fringe exclusion applies whether the employer owns or rents the parking  facility or parking space.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reimbursement of parking expenses. Any reimbursement to the  employee of the ordinary and necessary expenses of renting a parking  space on or near the business premises of the employer is excludable as  a working condition fringe. The preceding sentence does not apply,  however, to cash payments that are not actually used for renting a  parking space. Thus, that part of a general transportation allowance  that is not used for parking is not excludable as a working condition  fringe under this paragraph (p).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Parking on residential property. With respect to an employee,  this paragraph (p) does not apply to any parking facility or space  located on property owned or leased for residential purposes by the  employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Nonapplicability of nondiscrimination rules. Except to the  extent provided in paragraph (n)(3) of this section, the  nondiscrimination rules of section 132(h)(1) and Sec. 1.132-8T do not  apply in determining the amount, if any, of a working condition fringe.
