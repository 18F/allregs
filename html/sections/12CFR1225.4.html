                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standard for imposing a temporary increase. In making a  determination to increase temporarily a minimum capital requirement for  a regulated entity or entities, the Director will consider the necessity  and consistency of such an increase with the prudential regulation and  the safe and sound operations of a regulated entity. The Director may  impose a temporary minimum-capital increase if consideration of one or  more of the following factors leads the Director to the judgment that  the current minimum capital requirement for a regulated entity is  insufficient to address the entity's risks:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Current or anticipated declines in the value of assets held by a  regulated entity; the amounts of mortgage-backed securities issued or  guaranteed by the regulated entity; and, its ability to access liquidity  and funding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Credit (including counterparty), market, operational and other  risks facing a regulated entity, especially where an increase in risks  is foreseeable and consequential;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Current or projected declines in the capital held by a regulated  entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A regulated entity's material non-compliance with regulations,  written orders, or agreements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Housing finance market conditions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Level of reserves or retained earnings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Initiatives, operations, products, or practices that entail  heightened risk;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> With respect to a Bank, the ratio of the market value of its  equity to par value of its capital stock where the market value of  equity is the value calculated and reported by the Bank as ``market  value of total capital'' under 12 CFR 932.5(a)(1)(ii)(A); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Other conditions as detailed by the Director in the notice  provided under Sec. 1225.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standard for rescission of a temporary increase. In making a  determination to rescind a temporary increase in the minimum capital  level for a regulated entity or entities, whether in full or in part,  the Director will consider the consistency of such a rescission with the  prudential regulation and safe and sound operations of a regulated  entity. The Director will rescind, in full or in part, a temporary  minimum capital increase if consideration of one or more of the  following factors leads the Director to the judgment that rescission of  a temporary minimum-capital increase for a regulated entity is  appropriate considering the entity's risks:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Changes to the circumstances or facts that led to the imposition  of a temporary increase in the minimum capital levels;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The meeting of targets set for a regulated entity in advance of  any capital or capital-related plan agreed to by the Director;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Changed circumstances or facts based on new developments  occurring since the imposition of the temporary increase in the minimum  capital level, particularly where the original problems or concerns have  been successfully addressed or alleviated in whole or in part; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Such other standard as the Director may consider as detailed by  the Director in the notice provided under Sec. 1225.3.</p>
