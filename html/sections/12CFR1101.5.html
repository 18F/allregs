                            <p class="depth0">No person shall testify, in court or otherwise, as a result of  activities on behalf of the Council without prior written authorization  from the Council. This section shall not restrict the authority of a  Council member to testify before Congress on matters within his or her  official responsibilities as a Council member. No person shall furnish  documents reflecting information of the Council in compliance with a  subpoena, order, or otherwise, without prior written authorization from  the Council. The Council may authorize testimony or production of  documents after the litigant (or the litigant's attorney) submits an  affidavit to the Council setting forth the interest of the litigant and  the testimony or documents desired. Authorization to testify or produce  documents is limited to authority expressly granted by the Council. When  the Council has not authorized testimony or production of documents, the  individual to whom the subpoena or order has been directed will appear  in court and respectfully state that he or she is unable to comply  further with the subpoena or order by reason of this section.</p>
