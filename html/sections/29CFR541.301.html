                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To qualify for the learned professional exemption, an employee's  primary duty must be the performance of work requiring advanced  knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a  prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction. This primary  duty test includes three elements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee must perform work requiring advanced knowledge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or  learning; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The advanced knowledge must be customarily acquired by a  prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The phrase ``work requiring advanced knowledge'' means work  which is predominantly intellectual in character, and which includes  work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment, as  distinguished from performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical or  physical work. An employee who performs work requiring advanced  knowledge generally uses the advanced knowledge to analyze, interpret or  make deductions from varying facts or circumstances. Advanced knowledge  cannot be attained at the high school level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The phrase ``field of science or learning'' includes the  traditional professions of law, medicine, theology, accounting,  actuarial computation, engineering, architecture, teaching, various  types of physical, chemical and biological sciences, pharmacy and other  similar occupations that have a recognized professional status as  distinguished from the mechanical arts or skilled trades where in some  instances the knowledge is of a fairly advanced type, but is not in a  field of science or learning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The phrase ``customarily acquired by a prolonged course of  specialized intellectual instruction'' restricts the exemption to  professions where specialized academic training is a standard  prerequisite for entrance into the profession. The best prima facie  evidence that an employee meets this requirement is possession of the  appropriate academic degree. However, the word ``customarily'' means  that the exemption is also available to employees in such professions  who have substantially the same knowledge level and perform  substantially the same work as the degreed employees, but who attained  the advanced knowledge through a combination of work experience and  intellectual instruction. Thus, for example, the learned professional  exemption is available to the occasional lawyer who has not gone to law  school, or the occasional chemist who is not the possessor of a degree  in chemistry. However, the learned professional exemption is not  available for occupations that customarily may be performed with only  the general knowledge acquired by an academic degree in any field, with  knowledge acquired through an apprenticeship, or with training in the  performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical processes.  The learned professional exemption also does not apply to occupations in  which most employees have acquired their skill by experience rather than  by advanced specialized intellectual instruction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Registered or certified medical technologists. Registered or  certified medical technologists who have successfully completed three  academic years of pre-professional study in an accredited college or  university plus a fourth year of professional course work in a school of  medical technology approved by the Council of Medical Education of the  American Medical Association generally meet the duties requirements for  the learned professional exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nurses. Registered nurses who are registered by the appropriate  State examining board generally meet the duties requirements for the  learned professional exemption. Licensed practical nurses and other  similar health care employees, however, generally do not qualify as  exempt learned professionals because possession of a specialized  advanced academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for entry into  such occupations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dental hygienists. Dental hygienists who have successfully  completed four academic years of pre-professional and professional study  in an accredited college or university approved by the Commission on  Accreditation of Dental and Dental Auxiliary Educational Programs of the  American Dental Association generally meet the duties requirements for  the learned professional exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Physician assistants. Physician assistants who have successfully  completed four academic years of pre-professional and professional  study, including graduation from a physician assistant program  accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the  Physician Assistant, and who are certified by the National   Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants generally meet the  duties requirements for the learned professional exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Accountants. Certified public accountants generally meet the  duties requirements for the learned professional exemption. In addition,  many other accountants who are not certified public accountants but  perform similar job duties may qualify as exempt learned professionals.  However, accounting clerks, bookkeepers and other employees who normally  perform a great deal of routine work generally will not qualify as  exempt professionals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Chefs. Chefs, such as executive chefs and sous chefs, who have  attained a four-year specialized academic degree in a culinary arts  program, generally meet the duties requirements for the learned  professional exemption. The learned professional exemption is not  available to cooks who perform predominantly routine mental, manual,  mechanical or physical work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Paralegals. Paralegals and legal assistants generally do not  qualify as exempt learned professionals because an advanced specialized  academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for entry into the field.  Although many paralegals possess general four-year advanced degrees,  most specialized paralegal programs are two-year associate degree  programs from a community college or equivalent institution. However,  the learned professional exemption is available for paralegals who  possess advanced specialized degrees in other professional fields and  apply advanced knowledge in that field in the performance of their  duties. For example, if a law firm hires an engineer as a paralegal to  provide expert advice on product liability cases or to assist on patent  matters, that engineer would qualify for exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Athletic trainers. Athletic trainers who have successfully  completed four academic years of pre-professional and professional study  in a specialized curriculum accredited by the Commission on  Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs and who are certified  by the Board of Certification of the National Athletic Trainers  Association Board of Certification generally meet the duties  requirements for the learned professional exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Funeral directors or embalmers. Licensed funeral directors and  embalmers who are licensed by and working in a state that requires  successful completion of four academic years of pre-professional and  professional study, including graduation from a college of mortuary  science accredited by the American Board of Funeral Service Education,  generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional  exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The areas in which the professional exemption may be available  are expanding. As knowledge is developed, academic training is broadened  and specialized degrees are offered in new and diverse fields, thus  creating new specialists in particular fields of science or learning.  When an advanced specialized degree has become a standard requirement  for a particular occupation, that occupation may have acquired the  characteristics of a learned profession. Accrediting and certifying  organizations similar to those listed in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(3),  (e)(4), (e)(8) and (e)(9) of this section also may be created in the  future. Such organizations may develop similar specialized curriculums  and certification programs which, if a standard requirement for a  particular occupation, may indicate that the occupation has acquired the  characteristics of a learned profession.</p>
