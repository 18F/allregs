                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What limitations apply? Pursuant to HOLA section 5(c)(1)(H), a  Federal savings association (``you'') may invest in obligations issued  by any state, territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof  (``governmental entity''), subject to appropriate underwriting and the  following conditions:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Aggregate          Per-issuer</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> General obligations.........  None..............  None. (2) Other obligations of a        None..............  10% of total</p><p class="depth4">governmental entity (e.g.,                            capital.</p><p class="depth4">revenue bonds) that hold one of</p><p class="depth4">the four highest investment</p><p class="depth4">grade ratings by a nationally</p><p class="depth4">recognized rating agency or</p><p class="depth4">that are nonrated but of</p><p class="depth4">investment quality.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> Obligations of a              As approved by      10% of total</p><p class="depth4">governmental entity that do not   your Regional       capital.</p><p class="depth4">qualify under any other           Director</p><p class="depth4">paragraph but are approved by</p><p class="depth4">your Regional Director. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What is a political subdivision? Political subdivision means a  county, city, town, or other municipal corporation, a public authority,  or a publicly-owned entity that is an instrumentality of a state or a  municipal corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What is a general obligation of a state or political  subdivision? A general obligation is an obligation that is guaranteed by  the full faith and credit of a state or political subdivision that has  the power to tax. Indirect payments, such as through a special fund, may  qualify as general obligations if a state or political subdivision with  taxing authority has unconditionally agreed to provide funds to cover  payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> What is appropriate underwriting for this type of investment? In  the case of a security rated in one of the four highest investment  grades by a nationally recognized rating agency, your assessment of the  obligor's credit quality may be based, in part, on reliable rating  agency estimates of the obligor's performance. For all other securities,  you must perform your own detailed analysis of credit quality. In doing  so, you must consider, as appropriate, the interest rate, credit,  liquidity, price, transaction, and other risks associated with the  investment activity and determine that such investment is appropriate  for your institution. You must also determine that the obligor has  adequate resources and willingness to provide for all required payments  on its obligations in a timely manner.  [66 FR 65826, Dec. 21, 2001]</p>
