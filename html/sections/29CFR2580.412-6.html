                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General scope of term. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A plan administrator, officer, or  employee shall be deemed to be ``handling'' funds or other property of a  plan, so as to require bonding under section 13, whenever his duties or  activities with respect to given funds or other property are such that  there is a risk that such funds or other property could be lost in the  event of fraud or dishonesty on the part of such person, acting either  alone or in collusion with others. While ordinarily, those plan  administrators, officers and employees who ``handle'' within the meaning  of section 13 will be those persons with duties related to the receipt,  safekeeping and disbursement of funds, the scope of the term ``handles''  and the prohibitions of paragraph (b) of section 13 shall be deemed to  encompass any relationship of an administrator, officer or employee with  respect to funds or other property which can give rise to a risk of loss  through fraud or dishonesty. This shall include relationships such as  those which involve access to funds or other property or decisionmaking  powers with respect to funds or property which can give rise to such  risk of loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 13 contains no exemptions based on the amount or value  of funds or other property ``handled'', nor is the determination of the  existence of risk of loss based on the amount involved. However,  regardless of the amount involved, a given duty or relationship to funds  or other property shall not be considered ``handling'', and bonding is  not required, where it occurs under conditions and circumstances in  which the risk that a loss will occur through fraud or dishonesty is  negligible. This may be the case where the risk of mishandling is  precluded by the nature of the funds or other property (e.g., checks,  securities or title papers which can not be negotiated by the persons  performing duties with respect to them). It may also be the case where  significant risk of mishandling in the performance of duties of an  essentially clerical character is precluded by fiscal controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General criteria for determining ``handling''. Subject to the  application of the basic standard of risk of loss to each situation,  general criteria for determining whether there is ``handling'' so as to  require bonding are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Physical contact. Physical contact with cash, checks or similar  property generally constitutes ``handling''. However, persons who from  time to time perform counting, packaging, tabulating, messenger or  similar duties of an essentially clerical character involving physical  contact with funds or other property would not be ``handling'' when they  perform these duties under conditions and circumstances where risk of  loss is negligible because of factors such as close supervision and  control or the nature of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Power to exercise physical contact or control. Whether or not  physical contact actually takes place, the power to secure physical  possession of cash, checks or similar property through factors such as  access to a safe deposit box or similar depository, access to cash or  negotiable assets, powers of custody or safekeeping, power to withdraw  funds from a bank or other account generally constitutes ``handling'',  regardless of whether the person in question has specific duties in  these matters and regardless of whether the power or access is  authorized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Power to transfer to oneself or a third party or to negotiate  for value. With respect to property such as mortgages, title to land and  buildings, or securities, while physical contact or the possibility of  physical contact may not, of itself, give rise to risk of loss so as to  constitute ``handling'', a person shall be regarded as ``handling'' such  items where he, through actual or apparent authority, can cause those  items to be transferred to himself or to a third party or to be  negotiated for value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Disbursement. Persons who actually disburse funds or other  property, such as officers or trustees authorized to sign checks or  other negotiable instruments, or persons who make cash disbursements,  shall be considered to be ``handling'' such funds or property. Whether  other persons who may influence, authorize or direct disbursements or  the signing or endorsing of checks or similar instruments will be  considered to be ``handling'' funds or other property shall be  determined by reference to the particular duties or responsibilities of  such persons as applied to the basic criteria of risk of loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Signing or endorsing checks or other negotiable instruments. In  connection with disbursements or otherwise, any persons with the power  to sign or endorse checks or similar instruments or otherwise render  them transferable, whether individually or as co-signers with one or  more persons, shall each be considered to be ``handling'' such funds or  other property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Supervisory or decision making responsibility. To the extent a  person's supervisory or decision making responsibility involves factors  in relationship to funds discussed in paragraph (b)(1), (2), (3), (4),  or (5) of this section, such persons shall be considered to be  ``handling'' in the same manner as any person to whom the criteria of  those paragraphs apply. To the extent that only general responsibility  for the conduct of the business affairs of the plan is involved,  including such functions as approval of contracts, authorization of  disbursements, auditing of accounts, investment decisions, determination  of benefit claims and similar responsibilities, such persons shall be  considered to be ``handling'' whenever the facts of the particular case  raise the possibility that funds or other property of the plan are  likely to be lost in the event of their fraud or dishonesty. The mere  fact of general supervision would not necessarily, in and of itself,  mean that such persons are ``handling.'' Factors to be accorded weight  are the system of fiscal controls, the closeness and continuity of  supervision, who is in fact charged with, or actually exercising final  responsibility for determining whether specific disbursements,  investments, contracts, or benefit claims are bona fide, regular and  made in accordance with the applicable trust instrument or other plan  documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For example, persons having supervisory or decisionmaking  responsibility would be ``handling'' to the extent they:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Act in the capacity of plan ``administrator'' and have ultimate  responsibility for the plan within the meaning of the definition of  ``administrator'' (except to the extent that it can be shown that such  persons could not, in fact, cause a loss to the plan to occur through  fraud or dishonesty);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exercise close supervision over corporate trustees or other  parties charged with dealing with plan funds or other property; exercise  such close control over investment policy that they, in effect,  determine all specific investments;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Conduct, in effect, a continuing daily audit of the persons who  ``handle'' funds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Regularly review and have veto power over the actions of a  disbursing officer whose duties are essentially ministerial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On the other hand, persons having supervisory or decisionmaking  responsibility would not be ``handling'' to the extent:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> They merely conduct a periodic or sporadic audit of the persons  who ``handle'' funds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Their duties with respect to investment policy are essentially  advisory;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> They make a broad general allocation of funds or general  authorization of disbursements intended to permit expenditures by a  disbursing officer who has final responsibility for determining the  propriety of any specific expenditure and making the actual  disbursement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A bank or corporate trustee has all the day to day functions of  administering the plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> They are in the nature of a Board of Directors of a corporation  or similar authority acting for the corporation rather than for the plan  and do not perform specific functions with respect to the operations of  the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Insured plan arrangements. In many cases, plan contributions  made   by employers or employee organizations or by withholding from employee's  salaries are not segregated from the general assets of the employer or  employee organization until payment for purchase of benefits from an  insurance carrier or service or other organization. No bonding is  required with respect to the payment of premiums or other payments made  to purchase such benefits directly from general assets, nor with respect  to the bare existence of the contract obligation to pay benefits. Such  arrangements would not normally be subject to bonding except to the  extent that monies returned by way of benefit payments, cash surrender,  dividends, credits or otherwise, and which by the terms of the plan  belonged to the plan (rather than to the employer, employee  organization, insurance carrier or service or other organization) were  subject to ``handling'' by plan administrators, officers or employees.</p>
