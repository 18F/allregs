The housing must be offered on a nondiscriminatory basis, without regard to race, color, religion, creed, national origin, handicap, age, familial status, or gender, in compliance with applicable Federal and state laws. For persons with disabilities displaced from a unit with reasonable accommodations, comparable housing should include similar accommodations. Such housing may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tenant-based assistance, such as assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program, 24 CFR part 982, except that such assistance will not be considered ``comparable housing'' until the family is actually relocated into such housing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Project-based assistance; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Occupancy in a unit operated or assisted by the PHA at a rental rate paid by the family that is comparable to the rental rate applicable to the unit from which the family is vacated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In-place tenants.

For the purpose of determining operating subsidy eligibility under 24 CFR part 990, a PHA must provide the following information in the application or immediately following application submission:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of occupied units at the time of demolition/disposition application approval;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A schedule for the relocation of those residents on a month-by-month basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The PHA is responsible for the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notifying each family residing in the development of the proposed demolition or disposition 90 days prior to the displacement date, except in cases of imminent threat to health and safety. The notification must include a statement that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The development or portion of the development will be demolished or disposed of;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The demolition of the building in which the family resides will not commence until each resident of the building has been relocated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each family displaced by such action will be provided comparable housing, which may include housing with reasonable accommodations for disability, if required under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 8, as described in paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Providing for the payment of the actual and reasonable relocation expenses of each resident to be displaced, including residents requiring reasonable accommodations because of disabilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ensuring that each displaced resident is offered comparable replacement housing as described in paragraph (b) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Providing any necessary counseling for residents that are displaced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In addition, the PHA's plan for the relocation of residents who would be displaced by the proposed demolition or disposition must indicate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of individual residents to be displaced;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The type of counseling and advisory services the PHA plans to provide;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> What housing resources are expected to be available to provide housing for displaced residents; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An estimate of the costs for counseling and advisory services and resident moving expenses, and the expected source for payment of these costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Uniform Relocation Act does not apply to demolitions and dispositions under this part.</p>
