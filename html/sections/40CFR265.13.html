                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Before an owner or operator treats, stores, or disposes of  any hazardous wastes, or nonhazardous wastes if applicable under  Sec. 265.113(d), he must obtain a detailed chemical and physical  analysis of a representative sample of the wastes. At a minimum, the  analysis must contain all the information which must be known to treat,  store, or dispose of the waste in accordance with this part and part 268  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The analysis may include data developed under part 261 of this  chap ter, and existing published or doc u mented data on the hazardous  waste or on waste generated from similar processes.  Comment: For example, the facility's records of analyses performed on  the waste before the effective date of these regulations, or studies  conducted on hazardous waste generated from processes similar to that  which generated the waste to be managed at the facility, may be included  in the data base required to comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this  section. The owner or operator of an off-site facility may arrange for  the generator of the hazardous waste to supply part of the information  required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except as otherwise  specified in 40 CFR 268.7 (b) and (c). If the generator does not supply  the information, and the owner or operator chooses to accept a hazardous  waste, the owner or operator is responsible for obtaining the  information required to comply with this section.]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The analysis must be repeated as necessary to ensure that it is  accurate and up to date. At a minimum, the analysis must be repeated:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the owner or operator is notified, or has reason to  believe, that the process or operation generating the hazardous wastes  or non-hazardous wastes, if applicable, under Sec. 265.113(d) has  changed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For off-site facilities, when the results of the inspection  required in paragraph (a)(4) of this section indicate that the hazardous  waste received at the facility does not match the waste designated on  the accompanying manifest or shipping paper.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator of an off-site facility must inspect and,  if necessary, analyze each hazardous waste movement received at the  facility to determine whether it matches the identity of the waste  specified on the accompanying manifest or shipping paper.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator must develop and follow a written waste  analysis plan which describes the procedures which he will carry out to  comply with paragraph (a) of this section. He must keep this plan at the  facility. At a minimum, the plan must specify:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The parameters for which each hazardous waste, or non-hazardous  waste if applicable under Sec. 265.113(d), will be analyzed and the  rationale for the selection of these parameters (i.e., how analysis for  these parameters will provide sufficient information on the waste's  properties to comply with paragraph (a) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The test methods which will be used to test for these  parameters;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The sampling method which will be used to obtain a  representative sample of the waste to be analyzed. A representative  sample may be obtained using either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> One of the sampling methods described in appendix I of part 261  of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An equivalent sampling method.  [Comment: See Sec. 260.20(c) of this chapter for related discussion.]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The frequency with which the initial analysis of the waste will  be reviewed or repeated to ensure that the analysis is accurate and up  to date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For off-site facilities, the waste analyses that hazardous waste  generators have agreed to supply; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Where applicable, the methods that will be used to meet the  additional waste analysis requirements for specific waste management  methods as specified in Secs. 265.200, 265.225, 265.252, 265.273,  265.314, 265.341, 265.375, 265.402, 265.1034(d), 265.1063(d), 265.1084,  and 268.7 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> For surface impoundments exempted from land disposal  restrictions under Sec. 268.4(a) of this chapter, the procedures and  schedule for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sampling of impoundment contents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The analysis of test data; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The annual removal of residues which are not delisted under  Sec. 260.22 of this chapter or which exhibit a char acter istic of  hazardous waste and either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Do not meet applicable treatment standards of part 268, subpart  D; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Where no treatment standards have been established;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such residues are prohibited from land disposal under  Sec. 268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such residues are prohibited from land disposal under  Sec. 268.33(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> For owners and operators seeking an exemption to the air  emission standards of Subpart CC of this part in accordance with  Sec. 265.1083--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If direct measurement is used for the waste determination, the  procedures and schedules for waste sampling and analysis, and the  results of the analysis of test data to verify the exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If knowledge of the waste is used for the waste determination,  any information prepared by the facility owner or operator or by the  generator of the hazardous waste, if the waste is received from off- site, that is used as the basis for knowledge of the waste.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For off-site facilities, the waste analysis plan required in  paragraph (b) of this section must also specify the procedures which  will be used to inspect and, if necessary, analyze each movement of  hazardous waste received at the facility to ensure that it matches the  identity of the waste designated on the accompanying manifest or  shipping paper. At a minimum, the plan must describe:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The procedures which will be used to determine the identity of  each movement of waste managed at the facility; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The sampling method which will be used to obtain a  representative sample of the waste to be identified, if the  identification method includes sampling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The procedures that the owner or operator of an off-site  landfill receiving containerized hazardous waste will use to determine  whether a hazardous waste generator or treater has added a biodegradable  sorbent to the waste in the container.
