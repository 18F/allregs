                            <p class="depth0">The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of  emissions in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Out of band emissions. The power of any emission outside of the  authorized operating frequency ranges must be attenuated below the  transmitting power (P) by a factor of at least 43 + 10 log(P) dB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Measurement procedure. Compliance with these rules is based on  the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth  of 100 kHz or greater. In the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and  adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least one  percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the  transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is  permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the  measured power is integrated over the full required measurement  bandwidth (i.e. 100 kHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as  specified). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal  between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above  the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are  attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternative out of band emission limit. Licensees in this  service may establish an alternative out of band emission limit to be  used at specified band edge(s) in specified geographical areas, in lieu  of that set forth in this section, pursuant to a private contractual  arrangement of all affected licensees and applicants. In this event,  each party to such contract shall maintain a copy of the contract in  their station files and disclose it to prospective assignees or  transferees and, upon request, to the FCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interference caused by out of band emissions. If any emission  from a transmitter operating in this service results in interference to  users of another radio service, the FCC may require a greater  attenuation of that emission than specified in this section.  [67 FR 77191, Dec. 17, 2002]    Sec. 22.921  911 call processing procedures; 911-only calling mode.</p><p class="depth2">Mobile telephones manufactured after February 13, 2000 that are  capable of operating in the analog mode described in the standard  document ANSI TIA/EIA-553-A-1999 Mobile Station--Base Station  Compatibility Standard (approved October 14, 1999--available for  purchase from Global Engineering Documents, 15 Inverness East,  Englewood, CO 80112), must incorporate a special procedure for  processing 911 calls. Such procedure must recognize when a 911 call is  made and, at such time, must override any programming in the mobile unit  that determines the handling of a non-911 call and permit the call to be  transmitted through the analog systems of other carriers. This special  procedure must incorporate one or more of the 911 call system selection  processes endorsed or approved by the FCC.  [67 FR 77192, Dec. 17, 2002]</p>
