                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Effective date of change in assignment. If the Exchange notifies a QHP issuer of a change in an enrollee's eligibility for cost-sharing reductions (including a change in the individual's eligibility under the special rule for family policies set forth in Sec. 155.305(g)(3) of this subchapter due to a change in eligibility of another individual on the same policy), then the QHP issuer must change the individual's assignment

such that the individual is assigned to the applicable standard plan or plan variation of the QHP as required under Sec. 156.410(b) as of the effective date of eligibility required by the Exchange.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Continuity of deductible and out-of-pocket amounts. In the case of a change in assignment to a different plan variation (or standard plan without cost-sharing reductions) of the same QHP in the course of a benefit year under this section, the QHP issuer must ensure that any cost sharing paid by the applicable individual under previous plan variations (or standard plan without cost-sharing reductions) for that benefit year is taken into account in the new plan variation (or standard plan without cost-sharing reductions) for purposes of calculating cost sharing based on aggregate spending by the individual, such as for deductibles or for the annual limitations on cost sharing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice upon assignment. Beginning on January 1, 2016, if an individual's assignment to a standard plan or plan variation of the QHP changes in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the issuer must provide to that individual a summary of benefits and coverage that accurately reflects the new plan variation (or standard plan variation without cost-sharing reductions) in a manner consistent with Sec. 147.200 of this subchapter as soon as practicable following receipt of notice from the Exchange, but not later than 7 business days following receipt of notice.
