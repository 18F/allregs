Where there is only one class of stock, a stockholder's percentage share of the value of the outstanding stock shall be equal to the percentage of the outstanding stock owned by the stockholder. If the corporation has more than one class of

stock the percentage share of the value of the stock owned by a stockholder shall be determined by the Deputy Administrator on the basis of market quotations, and if market quotations are lacking or too scarce to be recognized the percentage share of the value of the stock shall be determined by the Deputy Administrator on the basis of all relevant factors affecting the fair market value, including the rights and privileges of the various stock issues.
