                            <p class="depth0">The Service shall take prompt disciplinary action against an  employee committing prohibited activity, or whose conduct is prejudicial  to the best interests of the Service, or of a nature to bring discredit  to it. There are four major types of disciplinary action possible,  following the above proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reprimand. An official reprimand usually shall be issued to an  employee or special Government employee for a first offense which is not  serious.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Suspension. Under Civil Service and Federal Mediation and  Conciliation Service regulations, an employee or special Government  employee may   be suspended without pay during the course of an investigation of  alleged criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously  disgraceful conduct. Also, an employee may be suspended without pay for  a definite period of time because of some offense of a less serious  nature for which more drastic action is not justified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Demotion. When such action will ``promote the efficiency of the  Service,'' an employee or special Government employee may be demoted  because of some offense for which more drastic action is not justified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Separation. The Service is responsible for the prompt dismissal  of unsatisfactory, incompetent, or unfit employees. Separation  (dismissal or removal) can be the penalty for a single breach of conduct  that is extremely serious in nature.</p>
