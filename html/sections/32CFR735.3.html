A report shall also be made to local civil  authorities in the first port of entry if required by law and regulation  of such authorities when births occur on a   course inbound to the U.S. Additionally, the medical officer shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Furnish the parents with appropriate certificates and shall, if  the report is not accepted by the local registrar of vital statistics or  other civil authority, or in any case in which local authority has  indicated in writing that such a report will not be accepted,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Advise the parents to seek the advice of the nearest office of  the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (USINS), at the earliest  practicable time.
