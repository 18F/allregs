                            <p class="depth0">The label of each dilutable (liquid or solid) pesticide product packaged in a rigid nonrefillable container must include the following residue removal instructions as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Timing of the residue removal procedure. One of the following statements must immediately precede the instructions required in paragraph (b) of this section and must be consistent with the instructions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Clean container promptly after emptying.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Triple rinse or pressure rinse container (or equivalent) promptly after emptying.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``Triple rinse container (or equivalent) promptly after emptying.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Triple rinse instructions. The label of each dilutable pesticide product packaged in rigid nonrefillable containers must include one of the following sets of instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For liquid dilutable pesticide products in containers small enough to shake, use the following instructions: ``Triple rinse as follows: Empty the remaining contents into application equipment or a mix tank and drain for 10 seconds after the flow begins to drip. Fill the container \1/4\ full with water and recap. Shake for 10 seconds. Pour rinsate into application equipment or a mix tank or store rinsate for later use or disposal. Drain for 10 seconds after the flow begins to drip. Repeat this procedure two more times.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For solid dilutable pesticide products in containers small enough to shake, use the following instructions: ``Triple rinse as follows: Empty the remaining contents into application equipment or a mix tank. Fill the container \1/4\ full with water and recap. Shake for 10 seconds. Pour rinsate into application equipment or a mix tank or store rinsate for later use or disposal. Drain for 10 seconds after the flow begins to drip. Repeat this procedure two more times.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For containers that are too large to shake, use the following instructions: ``Triple rinse as follows: Empty remaining contents into application equipment or a mix tank. Fill the container \1/4\ full with water. Replace and tighten closures. Tip container on its side and roll it back and forth, ensuring at least one complete revolution, for 30 seconds. Stand the container on its end and tip it back and forth several times. Turn the container over onto its other end and tip it back and forth several times. Empty the rinsate into application equipment or a mix tank or store rinsate for later use or disposal. Repeat this procedure two more times.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pressure rinse instructions. The label of each dilutable pesticide product packaged in rigid nonrefillable containers may include one of the following sets of instructions, and one of them must be used if the statement in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is used. If one of these statements is included on the label, it must immediately follow the triple rinse instructions specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For liquid dilutable pesticide products, use the following label instruction: ``Pressure rinse as follows: Empty the remaining contents into application equipment or a mix tank and continue to drain for 10 seconds after the flow begins to drip. Hold container upside down over application equipment or mix tank or collect rinsate for later use or disposal. Insert pressure rinsing nozzle in the side of the container, and rinse at about 40 PSI for at least 30 seconds. Drain for 10 seconds after the flow begins to drip.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For solid dilutable pesticide products, use the following label instruction: ``Pressure rinse as follows: Empty the remaining contents into application equipment or a mix tank. Hold container upside down over application equipment or mix tank or collect rinsate for later use or disposal. Insert pressure rinsing nozzle in the side of the container, and rinse at about 40 PSI for at least 30 seconds.

(1) A registrant who wishes to require users to clean a container with a diluent other than water (e.g., solvents) must submit to EPA a written request to modify the residue removal instructions of this section. The registrant may not distribute or sell the pesticide with the modified residue removal instructions until EPA approves the request in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A registrant who wishes to require users to clean a container with a diluent other than water (e.g., solvents) must submit to EPA a written request to modify the residue removal instructions of this section. The registrant may not distribute or sell the pesticide with the modified residue removal instructions until EPA approves the request in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The registrant must indicate why a non-water diluent is necessary for efficient residue removal, and must propose residue removal instructions and disposal instructions that are appropriate for the characteristics and formulation of the pesticide product and non-water diluent. The proposed residue removal instructions must identify the diluent. If the Directions for Use permit the application of a mixture of the pesticide and the non-water diluent, the instructions may allow the rinsate to be added to the application equipment or mix tank. If the Directions for Use do not identify the non-water diluent as an allowable addition to the pesticide, the instructions must require collection and storage of the rinsate in a rinsate collection system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> EPA may approve the request if EPA finds that the proposed instructions are necessary and appropriate.</p>
