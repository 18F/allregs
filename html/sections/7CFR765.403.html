The Agency may  approve transfers of security with assumption of FLP debt, other than EM  loans for physical or production losses, by transferees eligible for the  type of loan being assumed if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transferee meets all loan and security requirements in part  764 of this chapter for the type of loan being assumed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The outstanding loan balance (principal and interest) does not  exceed the maximum loan limit for the type of loan as contained in Sec.  761.8 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assumption of Non-program loans.

Real estate loan  types the Agency no longer makes (i.e. EE, RL, RHF) may be assumed and  reclassified as FO loans if the transferee is eligible for an FO loan  under part 764 of this chapter and the property proposed for transfer  meets program requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Amount of assumption. The transferee must assume the lesser of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The outstanding balance of the transferor's loan; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The market value of the security, less prior liens and  authorized costs, if the outstanding loan balance exceeds the market  value of the property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Rates and terms.
