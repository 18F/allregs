                                Sec. 780.307  Exemption for employer's immediate family.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 13(a)(6)(B) of the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966 provides a minimum wage and overtime exemption in the case of ``any employee engaged in agriculture * * * if such employee is the parent, spouse, child, or other member of the employer's immediate family.'' The requirements of this exemption, evident from the statutory language, are that the employee be employed in agriculture and that he be a close blood relative, spouse or member of the employer's immediate family. Reference is made to subpart B of this part as to what constitutes employment in agriculture. The section 13(a)(6)(B) exemption applies to such an individual even though he is employed by an employer who otherwise used more than 500 man-days of agricultural labor in a calendar

quarter of the preceding calendar year, as discussed in Sec. 780.305.</p>
