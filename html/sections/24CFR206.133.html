                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payment of the mortgage. The contract of insurance shall be terminated if the mortgage is paid in full.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acquisition of title. If the mortgagee or a party other than the mortgagee acquires title at a foreclosure sale, or the mortgagee acquires title by a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and the mortgagee notifies the Secretary that a claim for the payment of the insurance benefits will not be presented, the contract of insurance shall be terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mortgagee fails to make payments. If the mortgagee fails to make the payments to the mortgagor as required under the mortgage, and does not reimburse the Secretary or assign the mortgage to the Secretary within 30 days from the demand by the Secretary for reimbursement or assignment, the contract of insurance shall automatically terminate. The Secretary may later reinstate the contract of insurance, which shall continue in force as if no termination had occurred, upon reimbursement with interest as provided in Sec. 206.121. Upon reinstatement, the mortgagee shall be liable for all MIP which would have been due if no termination had occurred, including late charge and interest as provided in Sec. 206.113.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of termination. The mortgagee shall give written notice to the Secretary within 15 days of the occurrence of an event under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. No contract of insurance shall be terminated under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section unless such notice is given.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Voluntary termination. The mortgagor and the mortgagee may jointly request the Secretary to approve the voluntary termination of the mortgage insurance contract. Prior to approval, the Secretary shall make certain that the mortgagor is aware of the consequences which could arise out of the voluntary termination of the contract of insurance. The provisions of Sec. 203.295 of this chapter concerning voluntary termination shall apply when a contract of insurance under this part is voluntarily terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effect of termination. When the insurance contract is terminated, the mortgagee shall pay the monthly MIP which has accrued for the current month and which has not yet been paid to the Secretary, but the obligation to pay any subsequent MIP shall cease and all rights of the mortgagor and mortgagee shall be terminated except as otherwise provided in this part.
