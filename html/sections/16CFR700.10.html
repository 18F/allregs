                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 102(c) prohibits tying arrangements that condition  coverage under a written warranty on the consumer's use of an article or  service identified by brand, trade, or corporate name unless that  article or service is provided without charge to the consumer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under a limited warranty that provides only for replacement of  defective parts and no portion of labor charges, section 102(c)  prohibits a condition that the consumer use only service (labor)  identified by the warrantor to install the replacement parts. A  warrantor or his designated representative may not provide parts under  the warranty in a manner which impedes or precludes the choice by the  consumer of the person or business to perform necessary labor to install  such parts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> ban against tying arrangements. Second, such  provisions are deceptive under section 110 of the Act, because a  warrantor cannot, as a matter of law, avoid liability under a written  warranty where a defect is unrelated to the use by a consumer of  ``unauthorized'' articles or service. This does not preclude a warrantor  from expressly excluding liability for defects or damage caused by such  ``unauthorized'' articles or service; nor does it preclude the warrantor  from denying liability where the warrantor can demonstrate that the  defect or damage was so caused.</p>
