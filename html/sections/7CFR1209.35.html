Each such successor appointment shall be for the remainder  of the term vacated. A vacancy will not be required to be filled if the  unexpired term is less than six months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No successor appointed to a vacated term of office shall  serve more than two successive three-year terms on the Council, except  as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any successor serving longer than one year may serve one  successive three-year term.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any successor serving one year or less may serve two successive  three-year terms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a member of the Council consistently refuses to perform the  duties of a member of the Council, or if a member of the Council is  known to be engaged in acts of dishonesty or willful misconduct, the  Council may recommend to the Secretary that the member be removed from  office. If the Secretary finds the recommendation of the Council shows  adequate cause, the Secretary shall remove such member from office.  Further, without recommendation of the Council, a member may be removed  by the Secretary upon showing of adequate cause, including the failure  by a member to submit reports or remit assessments required under this  part, if the Secretary determines that such member's continued service  would be detrimental to the achievement of the purposes of the Act.</p>
