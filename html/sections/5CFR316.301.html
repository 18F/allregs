                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An agency may make a term appointment for a period of more than  1 year but not more than 4 years to positions where the need for an  employee's services is not permanent. Reasons for making a term  appointment include, but are not limited to: project work, extraordinary  workload, scheduled abolishment, reorganization, contracting out of the  function, uncertainty of future funding, or the need to maintain  permanent positions for placement of employees who would otherwise be  displaced from other parts   of the organization. Agencies may extend appointments made for more than  1 year but less than 4 years up to the 4-year limit in increments  determined by the agency. The vacancy announcement should state that the  agency has the option of extending a term appointment up to the 4-year  limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> OPM may authorize exceptions beyond the 4-year limit when the  extension is clearly justified and is consistent with applicable  statutory provisions. Requests to make and/or extend appointments beyond  the 4-year limit must be initiated by the employing office and sent to  the appropriate OPM service center.  [63 FR 63783, Nov. 17, 1998]</p>
