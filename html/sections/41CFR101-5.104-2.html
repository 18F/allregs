                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever possible, determination of the economic feasibility of  a proposed centralized service shall be based upon standard data on the  relationship of the size of the Federal building, the number of  occupants, location, and other factors pertinent to the type of  centralized service being considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the absence of standard data on which a determination of  economic feasibility can be based, or where such data must be  supplemented by additional factual information, a formal feasibility  study may be made by GSA or a CASU workgroup, in coordination with local  agencies to be involved, prior to a final determination to proceed with  the furnishing of a centralized service. Generally, a formal feasibility  study will be made only if provision of the proposed centralized service  would involve the pooling of staff, equipment, and space which occupying  agencies otherwise would be required to use in providing the service for  themselves. Examples of centralized services which may require formal  studies include printing and duplicating plants and similar facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> On the basis of experience under the centralized services  program, GSA will develop criteria as to cost comparisons, production  needs, building population, number of agencies involved, and other  appropriate factors for consideration in determining the practicability  of establishing various types of centralized services.
