                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Action--any NASA activity including, but not limited to,  acquisition, construction, modification, changes in land use, issuance  of facilities use permits, and disposition of Federal lands and  facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Base flood--is that flood which has a one percent chance of  occurrence in any given year (also known as a 100-year flood). This term  is used in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to indicate the  minimum level of flooding to be used by a community in its floodplain  management regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Base floodplain--the 100-year floodplain (one percent chance  floodplain). Also see definition of floodplain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Critical action--any activity for which even a slight chance of  flooding would be too great, such as storing lunar samples or highly  toxic or water reactive materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Facility--any item made or placed by a person including  buildings, structures and utility items, marine structures, bridges and  other land development items, such as levees and drainage canals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Flood or flooding--a general and temporary condition of partial  or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of  inland and/or tidal waters, and/or the unusual and rapid accumulation or  runoff of surface waters from any source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Flood fringe--that portion of the floodplain outside of the  regulatory floodway (often referred to as ``floodway fringe'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Floodplain--the lowland and relatively flat areas adjoining  inland and coastal waters including flood-prone areas of offshore  islands, including at a minimum, that area subject to a one percent or  greater chance of flooding in any given year. The base floodplain shall  be used to designate the 100-year floodplain (one percent chance  floodplain). The critical action floodplain is defined as the 500-year  floodplain (0.2 percent chance floodplain). A large portion of NASA  coastal floodplains also encompasses wetlands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Floodproofing--the modification of individual structures and  facilities, their sites, and their contents to protect against  structural failure, to keep water out or to reduce the effects of water  entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Minimize--to reduce to the smallest possible amount or degree.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> One percent chance flood--the flood having one chance in 100 of  being exceeded in any one-year period (a large flood). The likelihood of  exceeding this magnitude increases in a time period longer than one  year, e.g., there are two chances in three of a larger flood exceeding  the one percent chance flood in a 100-year period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Practicable--capable of being done within existing constraints.  The test of what is practicable depends upon the situation and includes  consideration of the pertinent factors, such as environment, cost or  technology.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Preserve--to prevent modification to the natural floodplain  environment or to maintain it as closely as possible to its natural  state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Regulatory floodway--the area regulated by Federal, State or  local requirements; the channel of a river or other watercourse and the  adjacent land areas that must be reserved in an open manner; i.e.,  unconfined or unobstructed either horizontally or vertically to provide  for the discharge of the base flood so the cumulative increase in water  surface elevation is no more than a designated amount (not to exceed one  foot as set by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Restore--to re-establish a setting or environment in which the  natural functions of the floodplain can again operate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Wetlands--those areas that are frequently inundated by surface  or ground water and normally support a   prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that requires saturated or  seasonally saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction.  Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas such  as sloughs, potholes, river overflows, mud flats, wet meadows, and  natural ponds. Because all NASA wetlands lie in floodplains, and for  purposes of simplifying the procedures of this subpart, floodplains will  be understood as to encompass wetlands, except in cases where wetlands  factors require special consideration. (Also, see definition of  floodplain.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Support--actions which encourage or otherwise provide incentives  to undertake floodplain or wetlands development, such as extending roads  or utilities into or near a floodplain, therefore making floodplain  development more feasible.</p>
