                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When an owner of track learns that a rail in the track contains  any of the defects listed in the table contained in paragraph (c) of  this section, a person designated under Sec. 213.7 shall determine  whether the track may continue in use. If the designated person  determines that the track may continue in use, operation over the  defective rail is not permitted until--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The rail is replaced or repaired; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The remedial action prescribed in the table contained in  paragraph (c) of this section is initiated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an owner of track learns that a rail in the track contains  an indication of any of the defects listed in the table contained in  paragraph (c) of this section, the track owner shall verify the  indication. The track owner must verify the indication within four  hours, unless the track owner has an indication of the existence of a  defect that requires remedial action A, A2, or B identified in the table  contained in paragraph (c) of this section, in which case the track  owner must immediately verify the indication. If the indication is  verified, the track owner must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Replace or repair the rail; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Initiate the remedial action prescribed in the table contained  in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A track owner who learns that a rail contains one of the  following defects shall prescribe the remedial action specified if the  rail is not replaced or repaired, in accordance with this paragraph's  table:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JA14.000     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JA14.001     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JA14.002</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As used in this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bolt hole crack means a crack across the web, originating from a  bolt hole, and progressing on a path either inclined upward toward the  rail head or inclined downward toward the base. Fully developed bolt  hole cracks may continue horizontally along the head/web or base/web  fillet, or they may progress into and through the head or base to  separate a piece of the rail end from the rail. Multiple cracks  occurring in one rail end are considered to be a single defect. However,  bolt hole cracks occurring in adjacent rail ends within the same joint  must be reported as separate defects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Broken base means any break in the base of the rail.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compound fissure means a progressive fracture originating from a  horizontal split head that turns up or down, or in both directions, in  the head of the rail. Transverse development normally progresses  substantially at a right angle to the length of the rail.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Crushed head means a short length of rail, not at a joint, which  has drooped or sagged across the width of the rail head to a depth of  \3/8\ inch or more below the rest of the rail head and 8 inches or more  in length. Unlike flattened rail where the depression is visible on the  rail head only, the sagging or drooping is also visible in the head/web  fillet area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Damaged rail means any rail broken or otherwise damaged by a  derailment, broken, flat, or unbalanced wheel, wheel slipping, or  similar causes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Defective weld means a field or plant weld containing any  discontinuities or pockets, exceeding 5 percent of the rail head area  individually or 10 percent in the aggregate, oriented in or near the  transverse plane, due to incomplete penetration of the weld metal  between the rail ends, lack of fusion between weld and rail end metal,  entrainment of slag or sand, under-bead or shrinkage cracking, or  fatigue cracking. Weld defects may originate in the rail head, web, or  base, and in some cases, cracks may progress from the defect into either  or both adjoining   rail ends. If the weld defect progresses longitudinally through the weld  section, the defect is considered a split web for purposes of remedial  action required by this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Detail fracture means a progressive fracture originating at or  near the surface of the rail head. These fractures should not be  confused with transverse fissures, compound fissures, or other defects  which have internal origins. Detail fractures may arise from shelled  spots, head checks, or flaking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Engine burn fracture means a progressive fracture originating in  spots where driving wheels have slipped on top of the rail head. In  developing downward these fractures frequently resemble the compound or  even transverse fissures with which they should not be confused or  classified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Flattened rail means a short length of rail, not at a joint,  which has flattened out across the width of the rail head to a depth of  \3/8\ inch or more below the rest of the rail and 8 inches or more in  length. Flattened rail occurrences have no repetitive regularity and  thus do not include corrugations, and have no apparent localized cause  such as a weld or engine burn. Their individual length is relatively  short, as compared to a condition such as head flow on the low rail of  curves.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Head and web separation means a progressive fracture,  longitudinally separating the head from the web of the rail at the head  fillet area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Horizontal split head means a horizontal progressive defect  originating inside of the rail head, usually \1/4\ inch or more below  the running surface and progressing horizontally in all directions, and  generally accompanied by a flat spot on the running surface. The defect  appears as a crack lengthwise of the rail when it reaches the side of  the rail head.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Ordinary break means a partial or complete break in which there  is no sign of a fissure, and in which none of the other defects  described in this paragraph (d) is found.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Piped rail means a vertical split in a rail, usually in the  web, due to failure of the shrinkage cavity in the ingot to unite in  rolling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Split web means a lengthwise crack along the side of the web  and extending into or through it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Transverse fissure means a progressive crosswise fracture  starting from a crystalline center or nucleus inside the head from which  it spreads outward as a smooth, bright, or dark round or oval surface  substantially at a right angle to the length of the rail. The  distinguishing features of a transverse fissure from other types of  fractures or defects are the crystalline center or nucleus and the  nearly smooth surface of the development which surrounds it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Vertical split head means a vertical split through or near the  middle of the head, and extending into or through it. A crack or rust  streak may show under the head close to the web or pieces may be split  off the side of the head.  [79 FR 4256, Jan. 24, 2014; 79 FR 4633, Jan. 29, 2014]</p>
