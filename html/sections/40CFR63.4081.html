                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a facility  that applies coatings to large appliance parts   or products, and is a major source, is located at a major source, or is  part of a major source of emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP),  except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. A major source of  HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources  located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or  has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams  (Mg) (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of  22.68 Mg (25 tons) or more per year. You are not subject to this subpart  if your large appliance surface coating facility is located at, or is  part of, an area source of HAP emissions. An area source of HAP  emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources  located within a contiguous area and under common control that is not a  major source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The large appliance surface coating source category includes any  facility engaged in the surface coating of a large appliance part or  product. Large appliance parts and products include but are not limited  to cooking equipment; refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerated cabinets  and cases; laundry equipment; dishwashers, trash compactors, and water  heaters; and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) units,  air-conditioning (except motor vehicle) units, air-conditioning and  heating combination units, comfort furnaces, and electric heat pumps.  Specifically excluded are heat transfer coils and large commercial and  industrial chillers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (9)  of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surface preparation of large appliance parts and products;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Preparation of a coating for application (e.g., mixing in  thinners and other components);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application of a coating to large appliance parts and products  using, for example, spray guns or dip tanks;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Application of porcelain enamel, powder coating, and asphalt  interior soundproofing coating;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Flash-off, drying, or curing following the coating application  operation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Cleaning of equipment used in coating operations (e.g.,  application equipment, hangers, racks);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Storage of coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Conveying of coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials from  storage areas to mixing areas or coating application areas, either  manually (e.g., in buckets) or by automated means (e.g., transfer  through pipes using pumps); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Handling and conveying of waste materials generated by coating  operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The surface coating of large appliance parts such as metal or  plastic handles, hinges, or fasteners that have a wider use beyond large  appliances is not subject to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The surface coating of large appliances conducted for the  purpose of repairing or maintaining large appliances used by a facility  and not for commerce is not subject to this subpart unless organic HAP  emissions from the surface coating itself are as high as the rates  specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The surface coating of heat transfer coils or large commercial  and industrial chillers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The provisions of this subpart do not apply to research or  laboratory facilities; janitorial, building, and facility maintenance  operations; hobby shops operated for noncommercial purposes or coating  applications using hand-held non-refillable aerosol containers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The provisions of this subpart do not apply to processes  involving metal plating or phosphating of a substrate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you own or operate an affected source that is subject to this  subpart and at the same affected source you also perform surface coating  subject to any other subparts in this part, you may choose for the  affected source to comply with only one subpart. In order to choose this  alternative, the total mass of organic HAP emissions from all surface  coating operations in the affected source must be less than or equal to  the total mass of organic HAP   emissions that would result if it complied separately with all  applicable subparts. You must make this comparison for the initial  compliance period and report it in the Notification of Compliance Status  as required in Sec. 63.4110(b)(10) and in the Notification of  Compliance Status required by the other subparts. If you choose this  alternative, your demonstration of compliance with the other subpart  constitutes compliance with this subpart.</p>
