                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In cases of disability, a beneficiary is eligible for cost-of- living adjustments under 5 U.S.C. 8146a where injury-related disability  began more than one year prior to the date the cost-of-living adjustment  took effect. The employee's use of continuation of pay as provided by 5  U.S.C. 8118, or of sick or annual leave, during any part of the period  of disability does not affect the computation of the one-year period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where an injury does not result in disability but compensation  is payable for permanent impairment of a covered member, organ or  function of the body, a beneficiary is eligible for cost-of-living  adjustments under 5 U.S.C. 8146a where the award for such impairment  began more than one year prior to the date the cost-of-living adjustment  took effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In cases of recurrence of disability, where the pay rate for  compensation purposes is the pay rate at the time disability recurs, a  beneficiary is eligible for cost-of-living adjustments under 5 U.S.C.  8146a where the effective date of that pay rate began more than one year  prior to the date the cost-of-living adjustment took effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In cases of death, entitlement to cost-of-living adjustments  under 5 U.S.C. 8146a begins with the first such adjustment occurring  more than one year after the date of death. However, if the death was  preceded by a period of injury-related disability, compensation payable  to the survivors will be increased by the same percentages as the cost- of-living adjustments paid or payable to the deceased employee for the  period of disability, as well as by subsequent cost-of-living  adjustments to which the survivors would otherwise be entitled.</p>
