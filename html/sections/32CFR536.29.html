                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A revision or change of a previously filed claim may  constitute an amendment or a new claim. Upon receipt, the CJA must  determine whether a new claim has been filed. If so, the claim must be  logged with a new number and acknowledged in accordance with Sec.  536.27.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New claim. A new claim is filed whenever the writing alleges a  new theory of liability, a new tortfeasor, a new party claimant, a  different date or location for the claims incident, or other basic  element that constitutes an allegation of a different tort not  originally alleged. If the allegation is made verbally or by e-mail, the  claimant will be informed in writing that a new SF 95 must be filed. A  new claim must be filed not later than two years from the accrual date  under the FTCA. Filing a new claim creates an additional six month  period during which suit may not be filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amendment. An increase or decrease in the amount claimed  constitutes an amendment, not a new claim. Similarly, the addition of  required information not on the original claim constitutes an amendment.  Examples are date of birth, marital status, military status, names of  witnesses, claimant's address, description, or location of property or  insurance information. An amendment may be filed before or after the two  year SOL has run unless final action has been taken. A new number will  not be assigned to an amended claim; however, a change in the amount  will be annotated in the database.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 536.29: See the parallel discussion at DA Pam 27-162,  paragraph 2-8.</p>
