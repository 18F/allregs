In the case of all styles, not more than 7  percent of the drained weight of the contents of the container consists  of core material as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph  (b)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Uniformity of weight and shape--(a) Slices. The drained weight  of the largest unit in the container is not more than 1.4 times the  drained weight of the smallest unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Half slices and quarter slices. The drained weight of the  largest unit in a container is not more than 1.75 times the drained  weight of the smallest unit, except for an occasional broken piece due  to splitting or an occasional whole slice not completely cut through.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Broken slices. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Not more than 10 percent of the drained  weight of the contents of the container consists of pieces having an arc  of less than 90.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Not more than 5 percent of the drained weight of the contents of  the container:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consists of pieces that measure in thickness less than 8  millimeters (0.31 inch) or more than 25 millimeters (1 inch); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consists of pieces that measure less than 19 millimeters (0.75  inch) in   width as measured from the outer edge to the inner edge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Not more than 5 percent of the drained weight of the contents of  the container consists of broken slices having an outside diameter  differing by as much as 9.5 millimeters (0.37 inch) from that of those  present in greatest proportion by weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Spears. The drained weight of the largest unit in the container  is not more than 1.4 times the drained weight of the smallest unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Tidbits. Not more than 15 percent of the drained weight of the  contents of the container consists of units each of which weighs less  than three-fourths as much as the average drained weight of all the  untrimmed units in the container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Chunks. Not more than 15 percent of the drained weight of the  contents of the container consists of pieces weighing less than 5 grams  (0.18 ounce) each.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Cubes. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Not more than 10 percent of the drained weight of the  contents of the container consists of pieces that will pass through a  screen with square openings of 8 millimeters (0.31 inch) in the case of  the small cubes or large cubes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Not more than 15 percent of the drained weight consists of  pieces weighing more than 3 grams (0.11 ounce) each for small cubes and  18 grams (0.63 ounce) each for large cubes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Pieces.

Blemishes are normally removed in  preparation of pineapple for culinary use and include any of the  following, if in excess of 1.6 millimeters (0.06 inch) in the longest  dimension on the exposed surface of the unit: deep fruit eyes, pieces of  shell, brown spots, bruised portions, and other abnormalities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Slices, half slices, quarter slices, broken slices, spears,  tidbits, chunks, cubes, and pieces. Not more than 12.5 percent by count  of the units in the container may be blemished; but in containers having  not more than 5 units, 1 unit may be blemished; in containers having  more than 5 units, but not more than 10 units, 2 units may be blemished  and in containers having more than 10 units, but not more than 32 units,  4 units may be blemished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Crushed. Not more than 1.5 percent of the drained weight of the  contents of the container consists of fragments bearing blemishes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Excessively trimmed. Slices, half slices, and quarter slices  are considered excessively trimmed if the portion trimmed away exceeds 5  percent of the apparent physical bulk of the perfectly formed unit and  if the trimming destroys the normal circular shape of the outer or inner  edge of the unit. Broken slices, spears, and tidbits are excessively  trimmed if the trimming destroys the normal shape of the unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Slices, half slices, and quarter slices. Not more than 7.5  percent by count of the units in the container may be excessively  trimmed, but in containers having not more than 10 units, 1 unit may be  excessively trimmed; and in containers having more than 10 units, but  not more than 27 units, 2 units may be excessively trimmed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Broken slices and spears. Not more than 15 percent by count of  the total units in the container may be excessively trimmed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Tidbits. Not more than 15 percent of the drained weight of the  contents of the container consists of excessively trimmed units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Mashed. A unit that has lost its normal shape because of  ripeness that bears no mark of mechanical injury is not to be considered  mashed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Slices, half slices, and quarter slices. Not more than one unit  in containers of 25 units or less, and not more than 3 units in  containers of more than 25 units, are mashed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Broken slices. Not more than 5 percent by count of the units in  the container are mashed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Spears.

Not more than 3 units in containers of less than 70  units, and not more than 5 percent of the units in containers of 70  units or more, are mashed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Acidity. In the case of all styles, not more than 1.35 grams of  acid, calculated as anhydrous citric acid, is contained in 100  milliliters of the liquid drained from the product 15 days or more after  the pineapple is canned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Excessive liquid. The drained weight of crushed pineapple is  not less than 63 percent of the net weight of the contents of the  container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sampling and acceptance. Determine compliance as specified in  Sec. 145.3(o).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Methodology. The method to be employed to determine whether  canned pineapple meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) (i) through  (vi) of this section are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determine the drained weight of the canned pineapple by the  procedure prescribed in Sec. 145.3(n).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identify and separate any core material cleanly from each of  the units in the container, and weigh the aggregate of the core  material. Calculate the percent core material to determine compliance  with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of slices, half slices, quarter slices, spears,  tidbits, chunks, and pieces, check the weight of the units against the  requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) (a), (b), (d), (e), (f), and (h) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of broken slices, check the dimensions of each unit  against the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the case of cubes, and pieces, determine compliance with  paragraph (b)(1)(ii) (g) and (h) of this section by placing the units, a  few at a time, on the mesh of a U.S. Standard No. 8 sieve (8-millimeter  (0.31 inch)) mesh. After shaking gently, remove those units that remain  on the sieve before testing the next portion. Continue portion-wise  until all units are tested, then determine the aggregate weight of those  units that have passed through the sieve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Except in the case of crushed pineapple, segregate and count  each unit that is blemished as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this  section. In the case of crushed pineapple, segregate each fragment of  crushed pineapple bearing a blemish and determine the aggregate weight  of such fragments to determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(b)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Except in the case of chunks, cubes, pieces, and crushed  pineapple, inspect all the units in the container to determine those  that have been excessively trimmed, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Except in the case of cubes, pieces, and crushed pineapple,  count the total units in the container and the number of mashed units to  determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Determine the total acidity of the drained liquid by titration,  using the following method: Measure with a pipette 10 milliliters of the  unfiltered drained liquid into a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask. Add 25  milliliters of distilled or deionized water and 0.3 milliliter of 1- percent phenolphthalein solution. Titrate with one-tenth normal sodium  hydroxide solution to a faint, permanently pink coloration. Multiply the  number of milliliters of one-tenth normal sodium hydroxide required by  0.064 to calculate the number of grams of anhydrous citric acid per 100  milliliters of drained liquid to determine compliance with paragraph  (b)(3)(vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the quality of canned pineapple falls below the standard  prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the  general statement of substandard quality specified in Sec. 130.14(a) of  this chapter, in the manner and form specified in that section; however,  if the quality of the canned pineapple falls below standard with respect  to only one of the factors of quality specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i)  through (vii) of this section, there may be substituted for the second  line of the general statement of substandard quality (``Good Food--Not  High Grade'') one of the following new lines, placed after the  corresponding designation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section that the  canned pineapple fails to meet:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ``Poorly cored'' or ``Excessive core''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ``Mixed sizes'' or ``Irregular small pieces'', as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> ``Blemished'' or ``Contains blemished pieces''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> ``Excessively trimmed''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> ``Mashed units'' or ``Contains mashed units''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> ``Excessively tart''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> ``Contains excess liquid''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fill of Container. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The standard of fill of container for  canned crushed pineapple is a fill of not less than 90 percent of the  total capacity of the container, as determined by the general method for  fill of container prescribed in Sec. 130.12(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If canned crushed pineapple falls below the standard of fill of  container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label  shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in  Sec. 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein  specified.
