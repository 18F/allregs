                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section sets forth the procedures the State agency  shall perform in the selection of local agencies and the expansion,  reduction, and disqualification of local agencies already in operation.  In making decisions to intitiate, continue, and discontinue the  participation of local agencies, the State agency shall give  consideration to the need for Program benefits as delineated in the  Affirmative Action Plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application of local agencies. The State agency shall require  each agency, including subdivisions of the State agency, which desires  approval as a local agency, to submit a written local agency  application. After the receipt of an incomplete application, the State  agency shall provide written notification to the applicant agency of the  additional information needed. After the receipt of a complete  application, the State agency shall notify the applicant agency in  writing of the approval or disapproval of its application. When an  application is disapproved, the State agency shall advise the applicant  agency of the reasons for disapproval and of the right to appeal as set  forth in Sec. 246.18. When an agency submits an application and there  are no funds to serve the area, the applicant agency shall be notified  that there are currently no funds available for Program initiation or  expansion. The applicant agency shall be notified by the State agency  when funds become available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Program initiation and expansion. The State agency shall meet  the following requirements concerning Program initiation and expansion:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  of this section shall be applied to each area or special population  before eliminating that area from consideration and serving the next  area of special population. The State agency shall consider the number  of participants in each priority level being served by existing local  agencies in determining when it is appropriate to move into additional  areas in the Affirmative Action Plan or to expand existing operations in  an area. Additionally, the State agency shall consider the total number  of people potentially eligible in each area compared to the number being  served.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State agency shall provide a written justification to FNS  for not funding an agency to serve the highest priority area or special  population. Such justification may include its inability to administer  the Program, lack of interest expressed for operating   the Program, or for those areas or special populations which are under  consideration for expansion of an existing operation, a determination by  the State agency that there is a greater need for funding an agency  serving an area or special population not operating the Program. The  State agency shall use the participant priority system in Sec. 246.7 as  a measurement of greater need in such determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State agency may fund more than one local agency to serve  the same area or special population as long as more than one local  agency is necessary to serve the full extent of need in that area or  special population.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Local agency priority system. The State agency shall establish  standards for the selection of new local agencies. Such standards shall  include the following considerations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State agency shall consider the following priority system,  which is based on the relative availability of health and administrative  services, in the selection of local agencies:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> First consideration shall be given to a public or a private  nonprofit health agency that will provide ongoing, routine pediatric and  obstetric care and administrative services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Second consideration shall be given to a public or a private  nonprofit health or human service agency that will enter into a written  agreement with another agency for either ongoing, routine pediatric and  obstetric care or administrative services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Third consideration shall be given to a public or private  nonprofit health agency that will enter into a written agreement with  private physicians, licensed by the State, in order to provide ongoing,  routine pediatric and obstetric care to a specific category of  participants (women, infants or children).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Fourth consideration shall be given to a public or private  nonprofit human service agency that will enter into a written agreement  with private physicians, licensed by the State, to provide ongoing,  routine pediatric and obstetric care.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Fifth consideration shall be given to a public or private  nonprofit health or human service agency that will provide ongoing,  routine pediatric and obstetric care through referral to a health  provider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State agency must, when seeking new local agencies, publish  a notice in the local media (unless it has received an application from  a local public or nonprofit private health agency that can provide  adequate services). The notice will include a brief explanation of the  Program, a description of the local agency priority system (outlined in  this paragraph (d)), and a request that potential local agencies notify  the State agency of their interest. In addition, the State agency will  contact all potential local agencies to make sure they are aware of the  opportunity to apply. If an application is not submitted within 30 days,  the State agency may then select a local agency in another area. If  sufficient funds are available, a State agency will give notice and  consider applications outside the local area at the same time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Disqualification of local agencies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State agency may  disqualify a local agency--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the State agency determines noncompliance with Program  regulations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the State's Program funds are insufficient to support the  continued operation of all its existing local agencies at their current  participation level; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When the State agency determines, following a review of local  agency credentials in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section,  that another local agency can operate the Program more effectively and  efficiently.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State agency may establish its own criteria for  disqualification of local agencies. The State agency shall notify the  local agency of any State-established criteria. In addition to any State  established criteria, the State agency shall consider, at a minimum--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The availability of other community resources to participants  and the cost efficiency and cost effectiveness of the local agency in  terms of both food and nutrition services and administration costs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The percentages of participants in each priority level being  served by the local agency and the percentage of need being met in each  participant category;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The relative position of the area or special population served  by the local agency in the Affirmative Action Plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The local agency's place in the priority system in paragraph  (d)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The capability of another local agency or agencies to accept the  local agency's participants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When disqualifying a local agency under the Program, the State  agency shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Make every effort to transfer affected participants to another  local agency without disruption of benefits;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide the affected local agency with written notice not less  than 60 days in advance of the pending action which includes an  explanation of the reasons for disqualification, the date of  disqualification, and, except in cases of the expiration of a local  agency's agreement, the local agency's right to appeal as set forth in  Sec. 246.18; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ensure that the action is not in conflict with any existing  written agreements between the State and the local agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Periodic review of local agency qualifications. The State agency  may conduct periodic reviews of the qualifications of authorized local  agencies under its jurisdiction. Based upon the results of such reviews  the State agency may make appropriate adjustments among the  participating local agencies, including the disqualification of a local  agency when the State agency determines that another local agency can  operate the Program more effectively and efficiently. In conducting such  reviews, the State agency shall consider the factors listed in paragraph  (e)(2) of this section in addition to whatever criteria it may develop.  The State agency shall implement the procedures established in paragraph  (e)(3) of this section when disqualifying a local agency.
