(1) The agency must require an institution it accredits or preaccredits to submit a teach-out plan to the agency for approval upon the occurrence of any of the following events:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agency must require an institution it accredits or preaccredits to submit a teach-out plan to the agency for approval upon the occurrence of any of the following events:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary notifies the agency that the Secretary has initiated an emergency action against an institution, in accordance with section 487(c)(1)(G) of the HEA, or an action to limit, suspend, or terminate an institution participating in any title IV, HEA program, in accordance with section 487(c)(1)(F) of the HEA, and that a teach-out plan is required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The agency acts to withdraw, terminate, or suspend the accreditation or preaccreditation of the institution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The institution notifies the agency that it intends to cease operations entirely or close a location that provides one hundred percent of at least one program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A State licensing or authorizing agency notifies the agency that an institution's license or legal authorization to provide an educational program has been or will be revoked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency must evaluate the teach-out plan to ensure it provides for the equitable treatment of students under criteria established by the agency, specifies additional charges, if any, and provides for notification to the students of any additional charges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the agency approves a teach-out plan that includes a program that is accredited by another recognized accrediting agency, it must notify that accrediting agency of its approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The agency may require an institution it accredits or preaccredits to enter into a teach-out agreement as part of its teach-out plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The agency must require an institution it accredits or preaccredits that enters into a teach-out agreement, either on its own or at the request of the agency, to submit that teach-out agreement for approval. The agency may approve the teach-out agreement only if the agreement is between institutions that are accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency, is consistent with applicable standards and regulations, and provides for the equitable treatment of students by ensuring that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The teach-out institution has the necessary experience, resources, and support services to--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Provide an educational program that is of acceptable quality and reasonably similar in content, structure, and scheduling to that provided by the institution that is ceasing operations either entirely or at one of its locations; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Remain stable, carry out its mission, and meet all obligations to existing students; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The teach-out institution demonstrates that it can provide students access to the program and services without requiring them to move or travel substantial distances and that it will provide students with information about additional charges, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Closed institution.
