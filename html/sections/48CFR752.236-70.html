                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 736.570, for contracts for construction or  renovation using program funds, insert the following clause.</p><p class="depth0">Standards for Accessibility for the Disabled in USAID Construction</p><p class="depth0">Contracts (July 2007)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> One of the objectives of the USAID Disability Policy is to  engage other U.S. Government agencies, host country counterparts,  governments, implementing organizations and other donors in fostering a  climate of nondiscrimination against people with disabilities. As part  of this policy USAID has established standards for any new or renovation  construction project funded by USAID to allow access by people with  disabilities (PWDs). The full text of the policy paper can be found at  the following Web site: http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/disability/.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> USAID requires the contractor to comply with standards of  accessibility for people with disabilities in all structures, buildings  or facilities resulting from new or renovation construction or  alterations of an existing structure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The contractor must comply with the host country or regional  standards for accessibility in construction when such standards result  in at least substantially equivalent accessibility and usability as the  standard provided in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990  and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Guidelines of  July 2004. Where there are no host country or regional standards for  universal access or where the host country or regional standards fail to  meet the ADA/ABA threshold, the standard prescribed in the ADA and the  ABA must be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> New Construction. All new construction must comply with the  above standards for accessibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alterations. Changes to an existing structure that affect, or  could affect, the usability of the structure must comply with the above  standards for accessibility unless the contractor obtains the  contracting officer's advance approval that compliance is technically  infeasible or constitutes an undue burden or both. Compliance is  technically infeasible where structural conditions would require  removing or altering a load-bearing member that is an essential part of  the structural frame or because other existing physical or site  constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces, or  features that are in full and strict compliance with the minimum  requirements of the standard. Compliance is an undue burden where it  entails either a significant difficulty or expense or both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exceptions. The following construction related activities are  excepted from the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this  section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Normal maintenance, re-roofing, painting or wallpapering, or  changes to mechanical or electrical systems are not alterations and the  above standards do not apply unless   they affect the accessibility of the building or facility; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> emergency construction (which may entail the provision of  plastic sheeting or tents, minor repair and upgrading of existing  structures, rebuilding of part of existing structures, or provision of  temporary structures) intended to be temporary in nature. A portion of  emergency construction assistance may be provided to people with  disabilities as part of the process of identifying disaster- and crisis- affected people as ``most vulnerable.''
