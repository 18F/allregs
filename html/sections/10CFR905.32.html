                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Western will extend a project-specific percentage of the  marketable resource, determined to be available at the time future  resource extensions begin, to existing customers with long-term firm  power contracts. The remaining unextended power will be used to  establish project-specific resource pools. An initial level of 96  percent of the marketable resource will be extended for the Pick-Sloan  Missouri Basin Program--Eastern Division and the Loveland Area Projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At two 5-year intervals after the effective date of the  extension to existing customers, Western shall create a project-specific  resource pool increment of up to an additional 1 percent of the long- term marketable resource under contract at the time. The size of the  additional resource pool increment shall be determined by Western based  on consideration of the actual fair-share needs of eligible new  customers and other appropriate purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The initial pool percentages shall be applied to the marketable  resource determined to be available at the time future resource  extensions begin. Subsequent percentages shall be applied to the  resource under contract at the time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The additional resource pool increments shall be established by  pro rata withdrawals, on 2 years' notice, from then-existing customers.  Withdrawals could be mitigated or delayed if good water conditions  exist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Once the extensions for existing customers and allocations to  new customers from the resource pool have been made, additional power  resources may become available for various reasons. Any additional  available resources will be used as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If power is reserved for new customers but not allocated, or  resources are offered but not placed under contract, this power will be  offered on a pro rata basis to customers that contributed to the  resource pool through application of the extension formula in  Sec. 905.33.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If power resources become available as a result of the  enhancement of existing generation, project-use load efficiency  upgrades, the development of new resources, or resources turned back to  Western, Western may elect to use this power to reduce the need to  acquire firming resources, retain the power for operational flexibility,  sell these resources on a short-term basis, or allocate the power.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If resources become available due to imposition of penalties  pursuant to Sec. 905.17, Western may make such resources available  within the marketing area to existing customers that are in compliance  with subpart B, subject to withdrawal.</p>
