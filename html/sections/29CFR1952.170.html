Appeals from the granting or denial of requests for  variances will also come within the jurisdiction of this board.  Administrative adjudications will be the responsibility of the  California Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1))</em> will also be excluded from the  State's jurisdiction under this plan.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The plan includes procedures for providing prompt and effective  standards for the protection of employees against new and unforeseen  hazards and for furnishing information to employees on hazards,  precautions, symptoms, and emergency treatment; and procedures for  variances and the protection of employee from hazards.

The plan  sets out goals and provides a timetable for bringing it into full  conformity with part 1902 of this chapter upon enactment of the proposed  legislation by the State legislature. A merit system of personnel  administration will be used. In addition, efforts to achieve voluntary  compliance by employers and employees will include both on- and off-site  consultations. The plan is supplemented by letters dated March 21, 1973,  and April 10, 1973, from A. J. Reis, Assistant Secretary for  Occupational Safety and Health of the Agriculture and Service Agency of  the State of California.  [38 FR 10719, May 1, 1973]</p>
