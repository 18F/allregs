                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> provides that, upon a disposition of an  item of section 1250 property after December 31, 1969, the applicable  percentage of the lower of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The additional depreciation (as defined in Sec. 1.1250-2)  attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 in respect of the  property, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>  of this subdivision exceeds the amount determined under (a) of this  subdivision, then such excess shall be treated as provided in  subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For relation of section 1250 to  other provisions, see paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the amount determined under subdivision (i)(b) of this  subparagraph exceeds the amount determined under subdivision (i)(a) of  this subparagraph, then the applicable percentage of the lower of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The additional depreciation attributable to periods before  January 1, 1970, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Such excess,  shall also be recognized as ordinary income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If gain would be recognized upon a disposition of an item of  section 1250 property under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this  subparagraph, and if section 1250(d) applies, then the gain recognized  shall be considered as recognized first under subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph. (See example (3)(i) of paragraph (c)(4) of Sec. 1.1250- 3.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Meaning of terms. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of section 1250, the term  disposition shall have the same meaning as in   paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 1.1245-1. Section 1250 property is, in  general, depreciable real property other than section 1245 property. See  paragraph (e) of this section. See paragraph (d)(1) of this section for  meaning of the term applicable percentage. If, however, the property is  considered to have two or more elements with separate periods (for  example, because units thereof are placed in service on different dates,  improvements are made to the property, or because of the application of  paragraph (h) of Sec. 1.1250-3), see the special rules of Sec. 1.1250- 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of applying section 1250, the facts and  circumstances of each disposition shall be considered in determining  what is the appropriate item of section 1250 property. In general, a  building is an item of section 1250 property, but in an appropriate case  more than one building may be treated as a single item. For example, if  two or more buildings or structures on a single tract or parcel (or  contiguous tracts or parcels) of land are operated as an integrated unit  (as evidenced by their actual operation, management, financing, and  accounting), they may be treated as a single item of section 1250  property. For the manner of determining whether an expenditure shall be  treated as an addition to capital account of an item of section 1250  property or as a separate item of section 1250 property, see paragraph  (d)(2)(iii) of Sec. 1.1250-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion after December 31,  1969. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a disposition of section 1250 property by a  sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion after December 31, 1969, the  gain to which section 1250(a)(1) applies is the applicable percentage  for the property (determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section)  multiplied by the lower of (a) the additional depreciation in respect of  the property attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, or (b) the  excess (referred to as gain realized) of the amount realized over the  adjusted basis of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In addition to gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) and  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, gain may also be recognized under  section 1250(a)(2) and this subdivision if the gain realized exceeds the  additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969.  In such a case, the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a)(2)  and this subdivision is the applicable percentage for the property  (determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) multiplied by the  lower of (a) the additional depreciation attributable to periods before  January 1, 1970, or (b) the excess (referred to as remaining gain) of  the gain realized over the additional depreciation attributable to  periods after December 31, 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Section 1250 property which has an adjusted basis of  $500,000 is sold for $650,000 after December 31, 1969, and thus the gain  realized is $150,000. At the time of the sale the additional  depreciation in respect of the property attributable to periods after  December 31, 1969, is $190,000 and the applicable percentage is 100  percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(e) of this section). Since the gain  realized ($150,000), is lower than the additional depreciation  ($190,000), the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under  section 1250(a)(1) is $150,000 (that is, 100 percent of $150,000). No  gain is recognized under section 1250(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Section 1250 property which has an adjusted basis of  $440,000 is sold for $500,000 on December 31, 1974, and thus the gain  realized is $60,000. The property was acquired on March 31, 1966. At the  time of the sale, the additional depreciation attributable to periods  after December 31, 1969, is $20,000, and the additional depreciation  attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, is $60,000. The property  qualified as residential rental property for each taxable year ending  after December 31, 1969, and the applicable percentage is 95 percent  (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(c) of this section). The applicable percentage  under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is 15 percent. Since the  additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969  ($20,000), is lower than the gain realized ($60,000), the amount of gain  recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1) is $19,000 (that  is, 95 percent of $20,000). In addition, gain is recognized under  section 1250(a)(2) since there is remaining gain of $40,000 (that is,  the gain realized ($60,000) minus the additional depreciation  attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 ($20,000)). Since the  remaining gain of $40,000 is lower than the additional depreciation  attributable to periods before January 1, 1970 ($60,000), the amount of  gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2) is   $6,000 (that is, 15 percent of $40,000). The remaining $35,000 (that is,  gain realized $60,000, minus gain recognized under section 1250(a),  $25,000) of the gain may be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of  property described in section 1231.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other dispositions after December 31, 1969. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a  disposition of section 1250 property after December 31, 1969, other than  by way of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion, the gain to which  section 1250(a)(1) applies is the applicable percentage for the property  (determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section) multiplied by the  lower of (a) the additional depreciation in respect of the property  attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, or (b) the excess  (referred to as potential gain) of the fair market value of the property  over its adjusted basis. In addition, if the potential gain exceeds the  additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969,  then the gain to which section 1250(a)(2) applies is the applicable  percentage for the property (determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this  section) multiplied by the lower of (c) the additional depreciation  attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, or (d) the excess  (referred to as remaining potential gain) of the potential gain over the  additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969.  If property is transferred by a corporation to a shareholder for an  amount less than its fair market value in a sale or exchange, for  purposes of applying section 1250 such transfer shall be treated as a  disposition other than by way of a sale, exchange, or involuntary  conversion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Section 1250 property having an adjusted basis of  $500,000 and a fair market value of $550,000 is distributed by a  corporation to a stockholder in complete liquidation of the corporation  after December 31, 1969, and thus the potential gain is $50,000. At the  time of the liquidation, the additional depreciation for the property  attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, is $80,000 and the  applicable percentage is 100 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(e) of this  section). Since the potential gain of $50,000 is lower than the  additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969  ($80,000), the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under  section 1250(a)(1) is $50,000 (that is, 100 percent of $50,000) even  though in the absence of section 1250, section 336 would preclude  recognition of gain to the corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example (1) except that the  fair market value of the property is $650,000, and thus the potential  gain is $150,000. Since the additional depreciation attributable to  periods after December 31, 1969 ($80,000), is lower than the potential  gain of $150,000, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under  section 1250(a)(1) is $80,000 (that is, 100 percent of $80,000). In  addition, section 1250(a)(2) applies since there is remaining potential  gain of $70,000, that is, potential gain ($150,000) minus additional  depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 ($80,000).  The additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1,  1970, is $90,000 and the applicable percentage under paragraph (d)(2) of  this section is 50 percent. Since the remaining potential gain of  $70,000 is lower than the additional depreciation attributable to  periods before January 1, 1970 ($90,000), the amount of gain recognized  as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2) is $35,000 (that is, 50  percent of $70,000). Thus under section 1250(a), $115,000 (that is,  $80,000 under section 1250(a)(1), plus $35,000 under section 1250(a)(2))  is recognized as ordinary income, even though in the absence of section  1250, section 336 would preclude recognition of gain to the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Instances of nonapplication. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 1250(a)(1) does not  apply to losses. Thus, section 1250(a)(1) does not apply if a loss is  realized upon a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of property,  all of which is considered section 1250 property, nor does the section  apply to a disposition of such property other than by way of sale,  exchange, or involuntary conversion if at the time of the disposition  the fair market value of such property is not greater than its adjusted  basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In general, in the case of section 1250 property with a holding  period under section 1223 of more than 1 year, section 1250(a)(1) does  not apply if for periods after December 31, 1969, there are no  depreciation adjustments in excess of straight line (as computed under  section 1250(b) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1250-2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Allocation rules. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a sale, exchange, or  involuntary conversion of section 1250 property and nonsection 1250  property in one transaction after December 31, 1969, the   total amount realized upon the disposition shall be allocated between  the section 1250 property and the other property in proportion to their  respective fair market values. Such allocation shall be made in  accordance with the principles set forth in paragraph (a)(5) of Sec.  1.1245-1 (relating to allocation between section 1245 property and  nonsection 1245 property).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an item of section 1250 property has two (or more)  applicable percentages because one subdivision of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of  this section applies to one portion of the taxpayer's holding period  (determined under Sec. 1.1250-4) and another subdivision of such  paragraph applies with respect to another such portion, then the gain  realized on a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion, or the  potential gain in the case of any other disposition, shall be allocated  to each such portion of the taxpayer's holding period after December 31,  1969, in the same proportion as the additional depreciation with respect  to such item for such portion bears to the additional depreciation with  respect to such item for the entire holding period after December 31,  1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Dispositions before January 1, 1970--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ordinary income. In  general, section 1250(a)(2) provides that, upon a disposition of an item  of section 1250 property after December 31, 1963, and before January 1,  1970, the applicable percentage of the lower of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The additional depreciation (as defined in Sec. 1.1250-2)  attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, in respect of the  property, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this  paragraph) of section 1250 property. For relation of section 1250 to  other provisions, see paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Meaning of terms. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of section 1250, the term  disposition shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (a)(3) of Sec.  1.1245-1. Section 1250 property is, in general, depreciable real  property other than section 1245 property. See paragraph (e) of this  section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term applicable percentage  means 100 percent minus 1 percentage point for each full month the  property was held after the date on which the property was held 20 full  months. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If, however, the property  is considered to have two or more elements with separate holding periods  (for example, because units thereof are placed in service on different  dates, or improvements are made to the property), see the special rules  of Sec. 1.1250-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of applying section 1250, the facts and  circumstances of each disposition shall be considered in determining  what is the appropriate item of section 1250 property. In general, a  building is an item of section 1250 property, but in an appropriate case  more than one building may be treated as a single item. For manner of  determining whether an expenditure shall be treated as an addition to  the capital account of an item of section 1250 property or as a separate  item of section 1250 property, see paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of Sec.  1.1250-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion before January 1,  1970. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a disposition of section 1250 property by a  sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion before January 1, 1970, the  gain to which section 1250(a)(2) applies is the applicable percentage  for the property multiplied by the lower of (a) the additional  depreciation in respect of the property or (b) the excess (referred to  as gain realized) of the amount realized over the adjusted basis of the  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: Section 1250 property, which has an adjusted basis of  $200,000, is sold for $290,000 before January 1, 1970. At the time of  the sale the additional depreciation in respect of the property is  $130,000 and the applicable percentage is 60 percent. Since the gain  realized ($90,000, that is, amount realized, $290,000, minus adjusted  basis, $200,000) is lower than the additional depreciation ($130,000),  the amount of gain recognized as   ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2) is $54,000 (that is, 60 percent  of $90,000). The remaining $36,000 ($90,000 minus $54,000) of the gain  may be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property described  in section 1231.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other dispositions before January 1, 1970. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a  disposition of section 1250 property before January 1, 1970, other than  by way of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion, the gain to which  section 1250(a)(2) applies is the applicable percentage for the property  multiplied by the lower of (a) the additional depreciation in respect of  the property, or (b) the excess (referred to as potential gain) of the  fair market value of the property on the date of disposition over its  adjusted basis. If property is transferred by a corporation to a  shareholder for an amount less than its fair market value in a sale or  exchange, for purposes of applying section 1250 such transfer shall be  treated as a disposition other than by way of a sale, exchange, or  involuntary conversion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: Assume the same facts as in the example in subparagraph  (3)(ii) of this paragraph except that the property is distributed by a  corporation to a stockholder before January 1, 1970, in complete  liquidation of the corporation, and that at the time of the distribution  the fair market value of the property is $370,000. Since the additional  depreciation ($130,000) is lower than the potential gain of $170,000  (that is, fair market value, $370,000, minus adjusted basis, $200,000),  the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section  1250(a)(2) is $78,000 (that is, 60 percent of $130,000) even though, in  the absence of section 1250, section 336 would preclude recognition of  gain to the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Instances of nonapplication. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 1250(a)(2) does not  apply to losses. Thus, section 1250(a)(2) does not apply if a loss is  realized upon a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of property,  all of which is considered section 1250 property, nor does the section  apply to a disposition of such property other than by way of sale,  exchange, or involuntary conversion if at the time of the disposition  the fair market value of such property is not greater than its adjusted  basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In general, in the case of section 1250 property with a holding  period under section 1223 of more than one year, section 1250(a)(2) does  not apply if for periods after December 1, 1963, there are no  depreciation adjustments in excess of straight line (as computed under  section 1250(b) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1250-2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In a case in which section 1250 property (including each  element thereof, if any) has a holding period under Sec. 1.1250-4 (or  paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of Sec. 1.1250-5) of at least 10 years, section  1250(a)(2) does not apply. If within the 10-year period preceding the  date the property is disposed of, an element is added to the property by  reason, for example, of an addition to capital account, see Sec.  1.1250-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Allocation rule. In the case of a sale, exchange, or involuntary  conversion of section 1250 property and nonsection 1250 property in one  transaction before January 1, 1970, the total amount realized upon the  disposition shall be allocated between the section 1250 property and the  other property in proportion to their respective fair market values.  Such allocation shall be made in accordance with the principles set  forth in paragraph (a)(5) of Sec. 1.1245-1 (relating to allocation  between section 1245 property and nonsection 1245 property).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Relation of section 1250 to other provisions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. The  provisions of section 1250 apply notwithstanding any other provision of  subtitle A of the Code. See section 1250(i). Thus, unless an exception  or limitation under section 1250(d) and Sec. 1.1250-3 applies, gain  under section 1250(a) is recognized notwithstanding any contrary  nonrecognition provision or income characterizing provision. For  example, since section 1250 overrides section 1231 (relating to property  used in the trade or business), the gain recognized under section  1250(a) upon a disposition will be treated as ordinary income and only  the remaining gain, if any, from the disposition may be considered as  gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset if section 1231 is  applicable. See the example in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nonrecognition sections overridden. The nonrecognition  provisions of subtitle A of the Code which section 1250 overrides  include, but are not limited to, sections 267(d), 311(a), 336, 337,  501(a), and 512(b)(5). See section 1250(d) for the extent to which  section 1250(a) overrides sections 332, 351, 361, 371(a), 374(a), 721,  731, 1031, 1033, 1039, 1071, and 1081 (b)(1) and (d)(1)(A). For amount  of additional depreciation in respect of property disposed of by an  organization exempt from income taxes (within the meaning of section  501(a)), see paragraph (d)(6) of Sec. 1.1250-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exempt income. The fact that section 1250 provides for  recognition of gain as ordinary income does not change into taxable  income any income which is exempt under section 115 (relating to income  of States, etc.), 892 (relating to income of foreign governments), or  894 (relating to income exempt under treaties).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Treatment of gain not recognized under section 1250. Section  1250 does not prevent gain which is not recognized under section 1250  from being considered as gain under another provision of the Code, such  as, for example, section 1239 (relating to gain from sale of depreciable  property between certain related persons). Thus, for example, if section  1250 property which has an adjusted basis of $10,000 is sold for $17,500  in a transaction to which section 1239 applies, and if $5,000 of the  gain would be recognized under section 1250(a) then the remaining $2,500  of the gain would be treated as ordinary income under section 1239.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Normal retirement of asset in multiple asset account. Section  1250(a) does not require recognition of gain upon normal retirements of  section 1250 property in a multiple asset account as long as the  taxpayer's method of accounting, as described in paragraph (e)(2) of  Sec. 1.167(a)-8 (relating to accounting treatment of asset  retirements), does not require recognition of such gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Installment method. Gain from a disposition to which section  1250(a) applies may be reported under the installment method if such  method is otherwise available under section 453 of the Code. In such  case, the income (other than interest) on each installment payment shall  be deemed to consist of gain to which section 1250(a) applies until all  such gain has been reported, and the remaining portion (if any) of such  income shall be deemed to consist of other gain. For treatment of  amounts as interest on certain deferred payments, see section 483.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Applicable percentage--(1) Definition for purposes of section  1250(a)(1). (i) For purposes of section 1250(a)(1), the term applicable  percentage means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In the case of property disposed of pursuant to a written  contract which was, on July 24, 1969, and at all times thereafter  binding on the owner of the property, 100 percent minus 1 percentage  point for each full month the property was held after the date on which  the property was held 20 full months;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)(B)</em>  (relating to approved dispositions of certain Government-assisted  housing projects), 100 percent minus 1 percentage point for each full  month of the taxpayer's holding period for the property (determined  under Sec. 1.1250-4) during which the property qualified under this  sentence, beginning after the date on which the property so qualified  for 20 full months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In the case of residential rental property (as defined in  section 167(j)(2)(B)) other than that covered by (a) and (b) of this  subdivision, 100 percent minus 1 percentage point for each full month of  the taxpayer's holding period for the property (determined under Sec.  1.1250-4) included within a taxable year for which the property  qualified as residential rental property, beginning after the date on  which the property so qualified for 100 full months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In the case of property with respect to which a deduction was  allowed under section 167(k) (relating to the depreciation of  expenditures to rehabilitate low-income rental housing), 100   percent minus 1 percentage point for each full month of the taxpayer's  holding period (determined under Sec. 1.1250-4) beginning 100 full  months after the date on which the property was placed in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> In the case of all other property, 100 percent.  The provisions of (a), (b), and (c) of this subdivision shall not apply  with respect to additional depreciation described in section 1250(b)(4).  If the taxpayer's holding period under Sec. 1.1250-4 includes a period  before January 1, 1970, such period shall be taken into account in  applying each provision of this subdivision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A single item of property may have two (or more) applicable  percentages under the provisions of subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph. For example, if the provision of subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph which applies to an item of section 1250 property (or to an  element of such property if the property is treated as consisting of  more than one element under Sec. 1.1250-5) in the taxable year in which  the item (or element) is disposed of did not apply to the item (or  element) in a prior taxable year which is included within the taxpayer's  holding period under Sec. 1.1250-4 and which ends after December 31,  1969, then each provision of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall  apply only for the period during which the property qualified under such  provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the taxpayer makes rehabilitation expenditures and elects  to compute depreciation under section 167(k) with respect to the  property attributable to the rehabilitation expenditures, such property  will generally constitute a separate improvement under paragraph (c) of  Sec. 1.1250-5 and therefore will constitute an element of section 1250  property. For computation of applicable percentage and gain recognized  under section 1250(a) in such a case, see paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1250- 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Section 1250 property is sold on December 31, 1970,  pursuant to a written contract which was binding on the owner of the  property on July 24, 1969, and at all times thereafter. The property was  acquired on July 31, 1968. The applicable percentage for the property  under subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph is 91 percent, since the  property was held 29 full months.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Section 1250 property is sold on June 30, 1978. The  property was acquired by a calendar year taxpayer on June 30, 1966.  Subdivision (i)(e) of this subparagraph applies to the property in 1977  and 1978. However, subdivision (i)(c) of this subparagraph applied to  the property for the taxable years of 1970 through 1976. Thus, the  property has two applicable percentages under this subparagraph. The  period before January 1, 1970 (42 full months), and the period from 1970  through 1976 (84 full months) are both taken into account in determining  the applicable percentage under subdivision (i)(c) of this subparagraph.  Thus, the applicable percentage is 74 percent (that is, 100 percent  minus the excess of the holding period taken into account (126 full  months) over 100 full months). The applicable percentage for the years  1977 and 1978 is 100 percent under subdivision (i)(e) of this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Section 1250 property is sold on December 31, 1978. The  property was acquired by a calendar year taxpayer on December 31, 1969.  The taxpayer made rehabilitation expenditures in 1973 and properly  elected to compute depreciation under section 167(k) on the property  attributable to the expenditures for the 60-month period beginning on  January 1, 1974, the date such property was placed in service.  Subdivision (i)(c) applies to the property (other than the property with  respect to which a deduction was allowed under section 167(k)) for the  taxable years of 1970 through 1978 (108 full months) and the applicable  percentage for such property is 92 percent. The applicable percentage  for the property with respect to which a deduction under section 167(k)  was allowed is 100 percent under subdivision (i)(d) of this  subparagraph, since the holding period for purposes of such subdivision  begins on the date such property is placed in service.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Section 1250 property is sold by a calendar year taxpayer  on March 31, 1974. The property was transferred to the taxpayer by gift  on December 31, 1970, and under section 1250(e)(2), the taxpayer's  holding period for the property for purposes of computing the applicable  percentage includes the transferor's holding period of 80 full months.  Subdivision (i)(c) of this subparagraph applies to the property in the  years 1970 through 1974. The applicable percentage under subdivision (i)  (c) of this subparagraph is 81 percent, since the period before January  1, 1970 (68 full months), and that portion of the period after December  31, 1969, during which such subdivision applied (51 full months) are  taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, the term applicable percentage means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In case of property with a holding period of 20 full months or  less, 100 percent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In case of property with a holding period of more than 20 full  months but less than 10 years, 100 percent minus 1 percentage point for  each full month the property is held after the date on which the  property is held 20 full months; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In case of property with a holding period of at least 10  years, zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Holding period. For purposes of this paragraph, the holding  period of property shall be determined under the rules of Sec. 1.1250- 4, and not under the rules of section 1223, notwithstanding that the  property was acquired on or before December 31, 1963. In the case of a  disposition of section 1250 property which consists of 2 or more  elements (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1250-5), the  holding period for each element shall be determined under the rules of  paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of Sec. 1.1250-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Full month. For purposes of this paragraph, the term full month  (or full months) means the period beginning on a date in 1 month and  terminating on the date before the corresponding date in the next  succeeding month (or in another succeeding month), or, if a particular  succeeding month does not have such a corresponding date, terminating on  the last day of such particular succeeding month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Property is purchased on January 17, 1959. Under  paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.1250-4, its holding period begins on January  18, 1959, and thus at any time during the period beginning on October  17, 1960, and ending on November 16, 1960, the property is considered  held 21 full months and has an applicable percentage under section  1250(a)(2) of 99 percent. On and after January 17, 1969, the property  has a holding period of at least 120 full months (10 years) and,  therefore, the applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(2) for the  property is zero. Accordingly, no gain would be recognized under section  1250(a)(2) upon disposition of the property. If, however, the property  consists of two or more elements, see the special rules of Sec. 1.1250- 5.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Property is purchased on January 31, 1968. Under  paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.1250-4 its holding period begins on February  1, 1968, and thus at any time during the period beginning on February  29, 1968, and ending on March 30, 1968, the property is considered held  1 full month. At any time during the period beginning on March 31, 1970,  and ending on April 29, 1970, the property is considered held 26 full  months. At any time during the period beginning on April 30, 1970, and  ending on May 30, 1970, the property is considered held 27 full months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Section 1250 property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition. The term section 1250  property means any real property (other than section 1245 property, as  defined in section 1245(a)(3) and Sec. 1.1245-3) which is or has been  property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation  provided in section 167. See section 1250(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Character of property. For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph, the term is or has been property of a character subject to  the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167 shall have the  same meaning as when used in paragraph (a) (1) and (3) of Sec. 1.1245- 3. Thus, if a father uses a house in his trade or business during a  period after December 31, 1963, and then gives the house to his son as a  gift for the son's personal use, the house is section 1250 property in  the hands of the son. For exception to the application of section  1250(a) upon disposition of a principal residence, see section  1250(d)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Real property. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph, the term real property means any property which is not  personal property within the meaning of paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1245-3.  The term section 1250 property includes three types of depreciable real  property. The first type is intangible real property. For purposes of  this paragraph, a leasehold of land or of section 1250 property is  intangible real property, and accordingly such a leasehold is section  1250 property. However, a fee simple interest in land is not  depreciable, and therefore is not section 1250 property. The second type  is a building or its structural components within the meaning of  paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1245-3. The third type is all other tangible  real property except (a) property described in section 1245(a)(3)(B) as  defined in paragraph (c)(1) of Sec. 1.1245-3 (relating to property used  as an integral part of a specified activity or as a   specified facility), and (b) property described in section  1245(a)(3)(D). An elevator or escalator (within the meaning of section  1245(a)(3)(C)) is not section 1250 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: A owns and leases to B for a single lump-sum payment of  $100,000 property consisting of land and a fully equipped factory  building thereon. If 30 percent of the fair market value of such  property is properly allocable to the land, 25 percent to section 1250  property (the building and its structural components), and 45 percent to  section 1245 property (the equipment), then 55 percent of B's leasehold  is section 1250 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> and (5) of Sec.  1.1245-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> of Sec. 1.1250-3. For treatment of  section 1250 property as an unrealized receivable, see section 751(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The principles of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Section 1250 property which has an adjusted basis of  $350,000 is sold for $630,000 on December 31, 1984. The property was  acquired by a calendar year taxpayer on December 31, 1969. For the  taxable years from 1970 through 1980, the property qualified as  residential rental property and the applicable percentage for those  years is 68 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(c) of this section). For  taxable years from 1981 through 1984, the property did not qualify as  residential rental property and the applicable percentage for those  years is 100 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(e) of this section). The  additional depreciation for the years from 1970 through 1980 is  $120,000. The additional depreciation for the years from 1981 through  1984 is $20,000. The gain realized is $280,000 (that is, amount  realized, $630,000, minus adjusted basis $350,000). The gain recognized  as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1) is computed in two steps.  First, since the additional depreciation attributable to the years 1970  through 1980 ($120,000) is lower than the gain realized attributable to  such years determined under paragraph (a)(6) of this section ($240,000,  that is, gain realized, $280,000, multiplied by \12/14\), the gain  recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1) in the first step  is $81,600, that is, 68 percent of $120,000. Second, since the  additional depreciation attributable to the years 1981 through 1984  ($20,000) is lower than the gain realized attributable to those years  ($40,000, that is, gain realized, $280,000, multiplied by \2/14\), the  gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1) for the  years from 1981 through 1984 is $20,000 (that is, 100 percent of  $20,000). The total gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) is $101,600  (that is, $81,600 plus $20,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Section 1250 property which has an adjusted basis of  $400,000 is sold for $472,000 on December 31, 1978. The property   was acquired on December 31, 1966. The additional depreciation  attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, is $40,000 and the  applicable percentage under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is zero  percent. The property qualifies as residential rental property for the  years 1970 through 1976, but fails to qualify for 1977 and 1978. Under  paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the applicable percentage for the  years 1970 through 1976 is 80 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(c) of this  section), and the applicable percentage for the years 1977 and 1978 is  100 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(e) of this section). The additional  depreciation attributable to the years 1970 through 1976 is $50,000, and  the additional depreciation attributable to the years 1977 and 1978 is  $10,000. The gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1)  is computed in two steps. First, since the additional depreciation  attributable to the years 1970 through 1976 ($50,000) is lower than the  gain realized attributable to such years ($60,000, that is, $72,000  multiplied by \5/6\), the gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) in  the first step is $40,000 (that is, 80 percent of $50,000). Second,  since the additional depreciation attributable to 1977 and 1978  ($10,000) is lower than the gain realized attributable to such years  ($12,000, that is, $72,000 multiplied by \1/6\), the gain recognized  under section 1250(a)(1) in the second step is $10,000 (that is, 100  percent of $10,000). In addition, section 1250(a)(2) applies. However,  since the applicable percentage is zero percent, none of the gain is  recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2). Thus, the  remaining $22,000 (that is, gain realized, $72,000, minus gain  recognized under section 1250(a), $50,000) of the gain may be treated as  gain from the sale or exchange of property described in section 1231.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example (2) except that the  property is disposed of on December 31, 1980. The property qualifies as  residential rental property for the years 1979 and 1980. Thus, the  applicable percentage for years 1970 through 1976, 1979, and 1980 is 56  percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(c) of this section). The applicable  percentage for the years 1977 and 1978 is 100 percent (paragraph  (d)(1)(i)(e) of this section). The additional depreciation for the years  1979 and 1980 is $8,000. The gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) is  computed in two steps. First, since the additional depreciation  attributable to the years 1970 through 1976, 1979, and 1980 ($58,000) is  lower than the gain realized attributable to such years ($61,412, that  is, $72,000 multiplied by $58,000/$68,000), the gain recognized under  section 1250(a)(1) in the first step is $32,480 (that is, 56 percent of  $58,000). Second, since the additional depreciation attributable to 1977  and 1978 ($10,000) is lower than the gain realized attributable to such  years ($10,588, that is, $72,000 multiplied by $10,000/$68,000) the gain  recognized under section 1250(a)(1) in the second step is $10,000 (that  is, 100 percent of $10,000). In addition section 1250(a)(2) applies.  However, since the applicable percentage is zero percent, none of the  gain is recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2). Thus,  the remaining $29,520 (that is, gain realized, $72,000, minus gain  recognized under section 1250(a), $42,480) of the gain may be treated as  gain from the sale or exchange of property described in section 1231.
