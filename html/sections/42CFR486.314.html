                            <p class="depth0">If an OPO's de-certification is due to involuntary termination or  non-renewal of its agreement with CMS, the OPO may appeal the de- certification on substantive and procedural grounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice of initial determination. CMS mails notice to the OPO of  an initial   de-certification determination. The notice contains the reasons for the  determination, the effect of the determination, and the OPO's right to  seek reconsideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reconsideration. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Filing request. If the OPO is dissatisfied  with the de-certification determination, it has 15 business days from  receipt of the notice of de-certification to seek reconsideration from  CMS. The request for reconsideration must state the issues or findings  of fact with which the OPO disagrees and the reasons for disagreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An OPO must seek reconsideration before it is entitled to seek a  hearing before a hearing officer. If an OPO does not request  reconsideration or its request is not made timely, the OPO has no right  to further administrative review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reconsideration determination. CMS makes a written reconsidered  determination within 10 business days of receipt of the request for  reconsideration, affirming, reversing, or modifying the initial  determination and the findings on which it was based. CMS augments the  administrative record to include any additional materials submitted by  the OPO, and a copy of the reconsideration decision and sends the  supplemented administrative record to the CMS hearing officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request for hearing. An OPO dissatisfied with the CMS  reconsideration decision, must file a request for a hearing before a CMS  hearing officer within 40 business days of receipt of the notice of the  reconsideration determination. If an OPO does not request a hearing or  its request is not received timely, the OPO has no right to further  administrative review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Administrative record. The hearing officer sends the  administrative record to both parties within 10 business days of receipt  of the request for a hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The administrative record consists of, but is not limited to,  the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Factual findings from the survey(s) on the OPO conditions for  coverage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Data from the outcome measures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Rankings of OPOs based on the outcome data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Correspondence between CMS and the affected OPO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The administrative record will not include any privileged  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Pre-Hearing conference. At any time before the hearing, the CMS  hearing officer may call a pre-hearing conference if he or she believes  that a conference would more clearly define the issues. At the pre- hearing conference, the hearing officer may establish the briefing  schedule, sets the hearing date, and addresses other administrative  matters. The hearing officer will issue an order reflecting the results  of the pre-hearing conference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Date of hearing. The hearing officer sets a date for the hearing  that is no more than 60 calendar days following the receipt of the  request for a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Conduct of hearing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The hearing is open to both parties, CMS  and the OPO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The hearing officer inquires fully into all the matters at issue  and receives in evidence the testimony of witnesses and any documents  that are relevant and material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The hearing officer provides the parties with an opportunity to  enter an objection to the inclusion of any document. The hearing officer  will consider the objection and will rule on the document's  admissibility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The hearing officer decides the order in which the evidence and  the arguments of the parties are presented and the conduct of the  hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The hearing officer rules on the admissibility of evidence and  may admit evidence that would be inadmissible under rules applicable to  court procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The hearing officer rules on motions and other procedural items.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The hearing officer regulates the course of the hearing and  conduct of counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The hearing officer may examine witnesses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The hearing officer takes any action authorized by the rules in  this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Parties' rights. CMS and the OPO may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appear by counsel or other authorized representative, in all  hearing proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Participate in any pre-hearing conference held by the hearing  officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Agree to stipulations as to facts which will be made a part of  the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Make opening statements at the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Present relevant evidence on the issues at the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Present witnesses, who then must be available for cross- examination, and cross-examine witnesses presented by the other party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Present oral arguments at the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Hearing officer's decision. The hearing officer renders a  decision on the appeal of the notice of de-certification within 20  business days of the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reversal of de-certification. If the hearing officer reverses  CMS' determination to de-certify an OPO in a case involving the  involuntary termination of the OPO's agreement, CMS will not terminate  the OPO's agreement and will not de-certify the OPO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> De-certification is upheld. If the de-certification  determination is upheld by the hearing officer, the OPO is de-certified  and it has no further administrative appeal rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Extension of agreement. If there is insufficient time prior to  expiration of an agreement with CMS to allow for competition of the  service area and, if necessary, transition of the service area to a  successor OPO, CMS may choose to extend the OPO's agreement with CMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Effects of de-certification. Medicare and Medicaid payments may  not be made for organ procurement services the OPO furnishes on or after  the effective date of de-certification. CMS will then open the de- certified OPO's service area for competition as set forth in Sec.  486.316(c).</p>
