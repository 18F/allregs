                                Sec. 236.204  Track signaled for movements in both directions,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">On track signaled for movements in both directions, a train shall  cause one or more opposing signals immediately ahead of it to display  the most restrictive aspect, the indication of which shall be not more  favorable than ``proceed at restricted speed.'' Signals shall be so  arranged and controlled that if opposing trains can simultaneously pass  signals displaying proceed aspects   and the next signal in advance of each such signal then displays an  aspect requiring a stop, or its most restrictive aspect, the distance  between opposing signals displaying such aspects shall be not less than  the aggregate of the stopping distances for movements in each direction.  Where such opposing signals are spaced stopping distance apart for  movements in one direction only, signals arranged to display restrictive  aspects shall be provided in approach to at least one of the signals.  Where such opposing signals are spaced less than stopping distance apart  for movements in one direction, signals arranged to display restrictive  aspects shall be provided in approach to both such signals. In absolute  permissive block signaling, when a train passes a head block signal, it  shall cause the opposing head block signal to display an aspect with an  indication not more favorable than ``stop.''
