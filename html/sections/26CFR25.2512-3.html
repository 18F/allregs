                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Care should be taken to arrive at an accurate valuation of any  interest in a business which the donor transfers without an adequate and  full consideration in money or money's worth. The fair market value of  any interest in a business, whether a partnership or a proprietorship,  is the net amount which a willing purchaser, whether an individual or a  corporation, would pay for the interest to a willing seller, neither  being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable  knowledge of the relevant facts. The net value is determined on the  basis of all relevant factors including--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A fair appraisal as of the date of the gift of all the assets of  the business, tangible and intangible, including good will;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The demonstrated earning capacity of the business; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The other factors set forth in paragraph (f) of Sec. 25.2512-2  relating to the valuation of corporate stock, to the extent applicable.  Special attention should be given to determining an adequate value of  the good will of the business. Complete financial and other data upon  which the valuation is based should be submitted with the return,  including copies of reports of examinations of the business made by  accountants, engineers, or any technical experts as of or near the date  of the gift.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p>
