                            <p class="depth0">Compromise or adjustment offers may be initiated by the debtor or by  RHS. RHS will approve only those compromises and adjustments that are in  the best interest of the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Compromise. A compromise is an agreement by RHS to release a  debtor from liability upon receipt of a specified lump sum that is less  than the total amount due.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustments. An adjustment is an agreement by RHS to release a  debtor from liability generally upon receipt of an initial lump sum  representing the maximum amount the debtor can afford to pay and  periodic additional payments over a period of up to 5 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timing of offers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a settlement offer to be considered,  secured debts must be fully matured under the terms of the debt  instrument or must have been accelerated by RHS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unsecured debts owed after the sale of the security property may  be proposed for compromise or adjustment at any time. Debts that were  never secured may be proposed for compromise or adjustment when they are  due and payable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Retention of security property. The debtor may retain the  security property if the compromise payment is at least equal to the net  recovery value, and it is in the best interest of the Government to  allow the debtor to retain the security property.
