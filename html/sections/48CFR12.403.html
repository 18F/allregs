                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The clause at 52.212-4 permits the Government to  terminate a contract for commercial items either for the convenience of  the Government or for cause. However, the paragraphs in 52.212-4  entitled ``Termination for the Government's Convenience'' and  ``Termination for Cause'' contain concepts which differ from those  contained in the termination clauses prescribed in part 49.  Consequently, the requirements of part 49 do not apply when terminating  contracts for commercial items and contracting officers shall follow the  procedures in this section. Contracting officers may continue to use  part 49 as guidance to the extent that part 49 does not conflict with  this section and the language of the termination paragraphs in 52.212-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Policy. The contracting officer should exercise the Government's  right to terminate a contract for commercial items either for  convenience or for cause only when such a termination would be in the  best interests of the Government. The contracting officer should consult  with counsel prior to terminating for cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination for cause. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The paragraph in 52.2124 entitled  ``Excusable Delay'' requires contractors notify the contracting officer  as soon as possible after commencement of any excusable delay. In most  situations, this requirement should eliminate the need for a show cause  notice prior to terminating a contract. The contracting officer shall  send a cure notice prior to terminating a contract for a reason other  than late delivery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Government's rights after a termination for cause shall  include all the remedies available to any buyer in the marketplace. The  Government's preferred remedy will be to acquire similar items from  another contractor and to charge the defaulted contractor with any  excess reprocurement costs together with any incidental or consequential  damages incurred because of the termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a termination for cause is appropriate, the contracting  officer shall send the contractor a written notification regarding the  termination. At a minimum, this notification shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Indicate the contract is terminated for cause;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specify the reasons for the termination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Indicate which remedies the Government intends to seek or  provide a date by which the Government will inform the contractor of the  remedy; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> State that the notice constitutes a final decision of the  contracting officer and that the contractor has the right to appeal  under the Disputes clause (see 33.211).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The contracting officer, in accordance with agency procedures,  shall ensure that information related to termination for cause notices  and any amendments are reported. In the event the termination for cause  is subsequently converted to a termination for convenience, or is  otherwise withdrawn, the contracting officer shall ensure that a notice  of the conversion or withdrawal is reported. All reporting shall be in  accordance with 42.1503(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Termination for the Government's convenience. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the  contracting officer terminates a contract for commercial items for the  Government's convenience, the contractor shall be paid--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The percentage of the contract price reflecting the  percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of the termination  for fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment contracts;  or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of  the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours  expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s)  in the Schedule; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any charges the contractor can demonstrate directly resulted  from the termination. The contractor may demonstrate such charges using  its standard record keeping system and is not required to comply with  the cost accounting standards or the contract   cost principles in part 31. The Government does not have any right to  audit the contractor's records solely because of the termination for  convenience.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Generally, the parties should mutually agree upon the  requirements of the termination proposal. The parties must balance the  Government's need to obtain sufficient documentation to support payment  to the contractor against the goal of having a simple and expeditious  settlement.
