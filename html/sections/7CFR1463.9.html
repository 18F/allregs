Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, payment of such assessments are due to CCC no later than the end of each calendar year quarter. If prior to 30 calendar days before the end of a calendar year quarter CCC has not notified an entity of the amount that is required to be remitted in that quarter, no interest will be assessed by CCC under paragraph (d) of this section until 30 calendar days have elapsed from the date CCC provided notification of the amount owed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payments due under this subpart must be submitted to CCC by electronic fund transfer unless prior written approval has been obtained from CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The final two calendar year quarterly payments due to CCC under this part shall be due to CCC on September 30, 2014.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if CCC has not received payment of assessments determined to be owed at the end of a calendar year quarter, CCC will assess interest on such unpaid amount beginning on the first day of the calendar year quarter immediately following the end of such prior quarter. Such interest will be at the rate CCC assesses on delinquent debts in accordance with part 1403 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> With respect to funds placed in escrow that are refunded to the domestic manufacturer or importer of tobacco products due to the resolution of an appeal, interest will be paid on such amount from the date of receipt by CCC until the date of the refund.
