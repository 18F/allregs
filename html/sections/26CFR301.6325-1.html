                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Release of lien--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Liability satisfied or unenforceable. The  appropriate official shall issue a certificate of release for a filed  notice of Federal tax lien, no later than 30 days after the date on  which he finds that the entire tax liability listed in such notice of  Federal tax lien either has been fully satisfied (as defined in  paragraph (a)(4) of this section) or has become legally unenforceable.  In all cases, the liability for the payment of the tax continues until  satisfaction of the tax in full or until the expiration of the statutory  period for collection, including such extension of the period for  collection as is agreed to.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Bond accepted. The appropriate official shall issue a  certificate of release of any tax lien if he is furnished and accepts a  bond that is conditioned upon the payment of the amount assessed  (together with all interest in respect thereof), within the time agreed  upon in the bond, but not later than 6 months before the expiration of  the statutory period for collection, including any agreed upon  extensions. For provisions relating to bonds, see sections 7101 and 7102  and Sec. Sec. 301.7101-1 and 301.7102-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certificate of release for a lien which has become legally  unenforceable. The appropriate official shall have the authority to file  a notice of Federal tax lien which also contains a certificate of  release pertaining to those liens which become legally unenforceable.  Such release will become effective as a release as of a date prescribed  in the document containing the notice of Federal tax lien and  certificate of release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Satisfaction of tax liability. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)  of this section, satisfaction of the tax liability occurs when--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The appropriate official determines that the entire tax  liability listed in a notice of Federal tax lien has been fully  satisfied. Such determination will be made as soon as practicable after  tender of payment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer provides the appropriate official with proof of  full payment (as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section) with  respect to the entire tax liability listed in a notice of Federal tax  lien together with the information and documents set forth in paragraph  (a)(7) of this section. See paragraph (a)(6) of this section if more  than one tax liability is listed in a notice of Federal tax lien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Proof of full payment. As used in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this  section, the term proof of full payment means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An internal revenue cashier's receipt reflecting full payment of  the tax liability in question;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A canceled check in an amount sufficient to satisfy the tax  liability for which the release is being sought;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A record, made in accordance with procedures prescribed by the  Commissioner, of proper payment of the tax liability by credit or debit  card or by electronic funds transfer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any other manner of proof acceptable to the appropriate  official.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Notice of a Federal tax lien which lists multiple liabilities.  When a notice of Federal tax lien lists multiple tax liabilities, the  appropriate official shall issue a certificate of release when all of  the tax liabilities listed in the notice of Federal tax lien have been  fully satisfied or have become legally unenforceable. In addition, if  the taxpayer requests that a certificate of release be issued with  respect to one or more tax liabilities listed in the notice of Federal  tax lien and such liability has been fully satisfied or has become  legally unenforceable, the appropriate official shall issue a  certificate of release. For example, if a notice of Federal tax lien  lists two separate liabilities and one of the liabilities is satisfied,  the taxpayer may request the issuance of a certificate of release with  respect to the satisfied tax liability and the appropriate official  shall issue a release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Taxpayer requests. A request for a certificate of release with  respect to a notice of Federal tax lien shall be submitted in writing to  the appropriate official. The request shall contain the information  required in the appropriate IRS Publication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Discharge of specific property from the lien--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Property  double the amount of the liability. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The appropriate official may, in  his discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the  property subject to a Federal tax lien   imposed under chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code if he determines  that the fair market value of that part of the property remaining  subject to the Federal tax lien is at least double the sum of the amount  of the unsatisfied liability secured by the Federal tax lien and of the  amount of all other liens upon the property which have priority over the  Federal tax lien. In general, fair market value is that amount which one  ready and willing but not compelled to buy would pay to another ready  and willing but not compelled to sell the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following example illustrates a case in which a certificate  of discharge may not be given under this subparagraph:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The Federal tax liability secured by a lien is $1,000. The  fair market value of all property which after the discharge will  continue to be subject to the Federal tax lien is $10,000. There is a  prior mortgage on the property of $5,000, including interest, and the  property is subject to a prior lien of $100 for real estate taxes.  Accordingly, the taxpayer's equity in the property over and above the  amount of the mortgage and real estate taxes is $4,900, or nearly five  times the amount required to pay the assessed tax on which the Federal  tax lien is based. Nevertheless, a discharge under this subparagraph is  not permissible. In the illustration, the sum of the amount of the  Federal tax liability ($1,000) and of the amount of the prior mortgage  and the lien for real estate taxes ($5,000+$100=$5,100) is $6,100.  Double this sum is $12,200, but the fair market value of the remaining  property is only $10,000. Hence, a discharge of the property is not  permissible under this subparagraph, since the Code requires that the  fair market value of the remaining property be at least double the sum  of two amounts, one amount being the outstanding Federal tax liability  and the other amount being all prior liens upon such property. In order  that the discharge may be issued, it would be necessary that the  remaining property be worth not less than $12,200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Part payment; interest of United States valueless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Part  payment. The appropriate official may, in his discretion, issue a  certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to a  Federal tax lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code  if there is paid over to him in partial satisfaction of the liability  secured by the Federal tax lien an amount determined by him to be not  less than the value of the interest of the United States in the property  to be so discharged. In determining the amount to be paid, the  appropriate official will take into consideration all the facts and  circumstances of the case, including the expenses to which the  government has been put in the matter. In no case shall the amount to be  paid be less than the value of the interest of the United States in the  property with respect to which the certificate of discharge is to be  issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest of the United States valueless. The appropriate  official may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any  part of the property subject to the Federal tax lien if he determines  that the interest of the United States in the property to be so  discharged has no value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Discharge of property by substitution of proceeds of sale. The  appropriate official may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of  discharge of any part of the property subject to a Federal tax lien  imposed under chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code if such part of  the property is sold and, pursuant to a written agreement with the  appropriate official, the proceeds of the sale are held, as a fund  subject to the Federal tax liens and claims of the United States, in the  same manner and with the same priority as the Federal tax liens or  claims had with respect to the discharged property. This paragraph does  not apply unless the sale divests the taxpayer of all right, title, and  interest in the property sought to be discharged. Any reasonable and  necessary expenses incurred in connection with the sale of the property  and the administration of the sale proceeds shall be paid by the  applicant or from the proceeds of the sale before satisfaction of any  Federal tax liens or claims of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Right of substitution of value--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Issuance of certificate of  discharge to property owner who is not the taxpayer. If an owner of  property subject to a Federal tax lien imposed under chapter 64 of the  Internal Revenue Code submits an application for a certificate of  discharge pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the appropriate  official shall issue a certificate of discharge of such property after  the owner either   deposits with the appropriate official an amount equal to the value of  the interest of the United States in the property, as determined by the  appropriate official pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section, or  furnishes an acceptable bond in a like amount. This paragraph does not  apply if the person seeking the discharge is the person whose  unsatisfied liability gave rise to the Federal tax lien. Thus, if the  property is owned by both the taxpayer and another person, the other  person may obtain a certificate of discharge of the property under this  paragraph, but the taxpayer may not.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Refund of deposit and release of bond. The appropriate official  may, in his discretion, determine that either the entire unsatisfied tax  liability listed on the notice of Federal tax lien can be satisfied from  a source other than the property sought to be discharged, or the value  of the interest of the United States is less than the prior  determination of such value. The appropriate official shall refund the  amount deposited with interest at the overpayment rate determined under  section 6621 or release the bond furnished to the extent that he makes  this determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Refund request. If a property owner desires an administrative  refund of his deposit or release of the bond, the owner shall file a  request in writing with the appropriate official. The request shall  contain such information as the appropriate IRS Publication may require.  The request must be filed within 120 days after the date the certificate  of discharge is issued. A refund request made under this paragraph  neither is required nor is effective to extend the period for filing an  action in court under section 7426(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Internal Revenue Service's use of deposit if court action not  filed. If no action is filed under section 7426(a)(4) for refund of the  deposit or release of the bond within the 120-day period specified  therein, the appropriate official shall, within 60 days after the  expiration of the 120-day period, apply the amount deposited or collect  on such bond to the extent necessary to satisfy the liability listed on  the notice of Federal tax lien, and shall refund, with interest at the  overpayment rate determined under section 6621, any portion of the  amount deposited that is not used to satisfy the liability. If the  appropriate official has not completed the application of the deposit to  the unsatisfied liability before the end of the 60-day period, the  deposit will be deemed to have been applied to the unsatisfied liability  as of the 60th day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Application for certificate of discharge. Any person desiring a  certificate of discharge under this paragraph (b) shall submit an  application in writing to the appropriate official. The application  shall contain the information required by the appropriate IRS  Publication. For purposes of this paragraph (b), any application for  certificate of discharge made by a property owner who is not the  taxpayer, and any amount submitted pursuant to the application, will be  treated as an application for discharge and a deposit under section  6325(b)(4) unless the owner of the property submits a statement, in  writing, that the application is being submitted under another paragraph  of section 6325 and not under section 6325(b)(4), and the owner in  writing waives the rights afforded under paragraph (b)(4), including the  right to seek judicial review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Valuation of interest of United States. For purposes of  paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4) of this section, in determining the value  of the interest of the United States in the property, or any part  thereof, with respect to which the certificate of discharge is to be  issued, the appropriate official shall give consideration to the value  of the property and the amount of all liens and encumbrances thereon  having priority over the Federal tax lien. In determining the value of  the property, the appropriate official may, in his discretion, give  consideration to the forced sale value of the property in appropriate  cases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Estate or gift tax liability fully satisfied or provided for-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Certificate of discharge. If the appropriate official determines  that the tax liability for estate or gift tax has been fully satisfied,  he may issue a certificate of discharge of any or all property from the  lien imposed thereon. If the appropriate official determines that the  tax liability   for estate or gift tax has been adequately provided for, he may issue a  certificate discharging particular items of property from the lien. If a  lien has arisen under section 6324B (relating to special lien for  additional estate tax attributable to farm, etc., valuation) and the  appropriate official determines that the liability for additional estate  tax has been fully secured in accordance with Sec. 20.6324B-1(c) of  this chapter, the appropriate official may issue a certificate of  discharge of the real property from the section 6324B lien. The issuance  of such a certificate is a matter resting within the discretion of the  appropriate official, and a certificate will be issued only in case  there is actual need therefor. The primary purpose of such discharge is  not to evidence payment or satisfaction of the tax, but to permit the  transfer of property free from the lien in case it is necessary to clear  title. The tax will be considered fully satisfied only when  investigation has been completed and payment of the tax, including any  deficiency determined, has been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application for certificate of discharge. An application for a  certificate of discharge of property from the lien for estate or gift  tax should be filed with the appropriate official responsible for the  collection of the tax. It should be made in writing under penalties of  perjury and should explain the circumstances that require the discharge,  and should fully describe the particular items for which the discharge  is desired. Where realty is involved each parcel sought to be discharged  from the lien should be described on a separate page and each such  description submitted in duplicate. In the case of an estate tax lien,  the application should show the applicant's relationship to the estate,  such as executor, heir, devisee, legatee, beneficiary, transferee, or  purchaser. If the estate or gift tax return has not been filed, a  statement under penalties of perjury may be required showing (i) the  value of the property to be discharged, (ii) the basis for such  valuation, (iii) in the case of the estate tax, the approximate value of  the gross estate and the approximate value of the total real property  included in the gross estate, (iv) in the case of the gift tax, the  total amount of gifts made during the calendar year and the prior  calendar years subsequent to the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1932  and the approximate value of all real estate subject to the gift tax  lien, and (v) if the property is to be sold or otherwise transferred,  the name and address of the purchaser or transferee and the  consideration, if any, paid or to be paid by him.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For provisions relating to transfer certificates in the case of  nonresident estates, see Sec. 20.6325-1 of this chapter (Estate Tax  Regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Subordination of lien--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> By payment of the amount  subordinated. The appropriate official may, in his discretion, issue a  certificate of subordination of a lien imposed under chapter 64 of the  Internal Revenue Code upon any part of the property subject to the lien  if there is paid over to the appropriate officialr an amount equal to  the amount of the lien or interest to which the certificate subordinates  the lien of the United States. For this purpose, the tax lien may be  subordinated to another lien or interest on a dollar-for-dollar basis.  For example, if a notice of a Federal tax lien is filed and a delinquent  taxpayer secures a mortgage loan on a part of the property subject to  the tax lien and pays over the proceeds of the loan to a appropriate  official after an application for a certificate of subordination is  approved, the appropriate official will issue a certificate of  subordination. This certificate will have the effect of subordinating  the tax lien to the mortgage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To facilitate tax collection--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The appropriate  official may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of subordination of  a lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code upon any  part of the property subject to the lien if the appropriate official  believes that the subordination of the lien will ultimately result in an  increase in the amount realized by the United States from the property  subject to the lien and will facilitate the ultimate collection of the  tax liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The provisions of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a farmer needs money in order to harvest his crop. A  Federal tax lien,   notice of which has been filed, is outstanding with respect to A's  property. B, a lending institution is willing to make the necessary loan  if the loan is secured by a first mortgage on the farm which is prior to  the Federal tax lien. Upon examination, the appropriate official  believes that ultimately the amount realizable from A's property will be  increased and the collection of the tax liability will be facilitated by  the availability of cash when the crop is harvested and sold. In this  case, the appropriate official may, in his discretion, subordinate the  tax lien on the farm to the mortgage securing the crop harvesting loan.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. C owns a commercial building which is deteriorating and  in unsalable condition. Because of outstanding Federal tax liens,  notices of which have been filed, C is unable to finance the repair and  rehabilitation of the building. D, a contractor, is willing to do the  work if his mechanic's lien on the property is superior to the Federal  tax liens. Upon examination, the appropriate official believes that  ultimately the amount realizable from C's property will be increased and  the collection of the tax liability will be facilitated by arresting  deterioration of the property and restoring it to salable condition. In  this case, the appropriate official may, in his discretion, subordinate  the tax lien on the building to the mechanic's lien.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. E, a manufacturer of electronic equipment, obtains  financing from F, a lending institution, pursuant to a security  agreement, with respect to which a financing statement was duly filed  under the Uniform Commercial Code on June 1, 1970. On April 15, 1971, F  gains actual notice or knowledge that notice of a Federal tax lien had  been filed against E on March 31, 1971, and F refuses to make further  advances unless its security interest is assured of priority over the  Federal tax lien. Upon examination, the appropriate official believes  that ultimately the amount realizable from E's property will be  increased and the collection of the tax liability will be facilitated if  the work in process can be completed and the equipment sold. In this  case, the appropriate official may, in his discretion, subordinate the  tax lien to F's security interest for the further advances required to  complete the work.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Suit is brought against G by H, who claims ownership of  property the legal title to which is held by G. A Federal tax lien  against G, notice of which has previously been filed, will be  enforceable against the property if G's title is confirmed. Because  section 6323(b)(8) is inapplicable, J, an attorney, is unwilling to  defend the case for G unless he is granted a contractual lien on the  property, superior to the Federal tax lien. Upon examination, the  appropriate official believes that the successful defense of the case by  G will increase the amount ultimately realizable from G's property and  will facilitate collection of the tax liability. In this case, the  appropriate official may, in his discretion, subordinate the tax lien to  J's contractual lien on the disputed property to secure J's reasonable  fees and expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Subordination of section 6324B lien. The appropriate official  may issue a certificate of subordination with respect to a lien imposed  by section 6324B if the appropriate official determines that the  interests of the United States will be adequately secured after such  subordination. For example, A, a qualified heir of qualified real  property, needs to borrow money for farming purposes. If the current  fair market value of the real property is $150,000, the amount of the  claim to which the special lien is to be subordinated is $40,000, the  potential liability for additional tax (as defined in section 2032A(c))  is less than $55,000, and there are no other facts to indicate that the  interest of the United States will not be adequately secured, the  appropriate official may issue a certificate of subordination. The  result would be the same if the loan were for bona fide purposes other  than farming.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Application for certificate of subordination. Any person  desiring a certificate of subordination under this paragraph shall  submit an application therefor in writing to the appropriate official  responsible for the collection of the tax. The application shall contain  such information as the appropriate official may require.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Nonattachment of lien. If the appropriate official determines  that, because of confusion of names or otherwise, any person (other than  the person against whom the tax was assessed) is or may be injured by  the appearance that a notice of lien filed in accordance with Sec.  301.6323(f)-1 refers to such person, the appropriate official may issue  a certificate of nonattachment. Such certificate shall state that the  lien, notice of which has been filed, does not attach to the property of  such person. Any person desiring a certificate of nonattachment under  this paragraph shall submit an application therefor in writing to the  appropriate official responsible for the collection of the tax. The  application shall contain such information as the appropriate official  may require.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effect of certificate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Conclusiveness. Except as provided in  subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, if a certificate is issued  under section 6325 by the appropriate official and the certificate is  filed in the same office as the notice of lien to which it relates (if  the notice of lien has been filed), the certificate shall have the  following effect--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a certificate of release issued under paragraph  (a) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that the tax  lien referred to in the certificate is extinguished;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a certificate of discharge issued under  paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the certificate shall be  conclusive that the property covered by the certificate is discharged  from the tax lien;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a certificate of subordination issued under  paragraph (d) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that  the lien or interest to which the Federal tax lien is subordinated is  superior to the tax lien; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a certificate of nonattachment issued under  paragraph (e) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that  the lien of the United States does not attach to the property of the  person referred to in the certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Revocation of certificate of release or nonattachment--(i) In  general. If the appropriate official determines that either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A certificate of release or a certificate of nonattachment of  the general tax lien imposed by section 6321 was issued erroneously or  improvidently, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A certificate of release of such lien was issued in connection  with a compromise agreement under section 7122 which has been breached,  and if the period of limitation on collection after assessment of the  tax liability has not expired, the appropriate official may revoke the  certificate and reinstate the tax lien. The provisions of this  subparagraph do not apply in the case of the lien imposed by section  6324 relating to estate and gift taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Method of revocation and reinstatement. The revocation and  reinstatement described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is  accompanied by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Mailing notice of the revocation to the taxpayer at his last  known address (see Sec. 301.6212-2 for further guidance regarding the  definition of last known address); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Filing notice of the revocation of the certificate in the same  office in which the notice of lien to which it relates was filed (if the  notice of lien has been filed).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effect of reinstatement--(a) Effective date. A tax lien  reinstated in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph is  effective on and after the date the notice of revocation is mailed to  the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (ii)(a) of  this subparagraph, but the reinstated lien is not effective before the  filing of notice of revocation, in accordance with the provisions of  subdivision (ii)(b) of this subparagraph, if the filing is required by  reason of the fact that a notice of the lien had been filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Treatment of reinstated lien. As of the effective date of  reinstatement, a reinstated lien has the same force and effect as a  general tax lien imposed by section 6321 which arises upon assessment of  a tax liability. The reinstated lien continues in existence until the  expiration of the period of limitation on collection after assessment of  the tax liability to which it relates. The reinstatement of the lien  does not retroactively reinstate a previously filed notice of lien. The  reinstated lien is not valid against any holder of a lien or interest  described in Sec. 301.6323(a)-1 until notice of the reinstated lien has  been filed in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 301.6323(f)-1  subsequent to or concurrent with the time the reinstated lien became  effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated  by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. On March 1, 1967, an assessment of an unpaid Federal tax  liability is made against A. On March 1, 1968, notice of the Federal tax  lien, which arose at the time of assessment, is filed. On April 1, 1968,  A executes a bona fide mortgage on property belonging to him to B. On  May 1, 1968, a certificate of release of the tax lien is erroneously  issued and is filed by A in the same office in which the notice of lien  was filed. On June 3, 1968, the lien is reinstated in accordance with  the provisions of this subparagraph. On   July 1, 1968, A executes a bona fide mortgage on property belonging to  him to C. On August 1, 1968, a notice of the lien which was reinstated  is properly filed in accordance with the provisions of Sec.  301.6323(f)-1. The mortgages of both B and C will have priority over the  rights of the United States with respect to the tax liability in  question. Because a reinstated lien continues in existence only until  the expiration of the period of limitation on collection after  assessment of the tax liability to which the lien relates, in the  absence of any extension or suspension of the period of limitation on  collection after assessment, the reinstated lien will become  unenforceable by reason of lapse of time after February 28, 1973.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certificates void under certain conditions. Notwithstanding any  other provisions of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code, any lien  for Federal taxes attaches to any property with respect to which a  certificate of discharge has been issued if the person liable for the  tax reacquires the property after the certificate has been issued. Thus,  if property subject to a Federal tax lien is discharged therefrom and is  later reacquired by the delinquent taxpayer at a time when the lien is  still in existence, the tax lien attaches to the reacquired property and  is enforceable against it as in the case of after-acquired property  generally.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Filing of certificates and notices.
