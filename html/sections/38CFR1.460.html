Whenever such diagnosis or other information, not originally received or obtained for the purpose of obtaining or providing one of the above program or activity functions, is subsequently used in connection with such program or activity functions, those original entries become a ``record'' and Sec. Sec.  1.460 through 1.499 of this part thereafter apply to those entries. Segregability: these regulations do not apply to records or information contained therein, the disclosure of which (the circumstances surrounding the disclosure having been considered) could not reasonably be expected to disclose the fact that a patient has been connected with a VA program or activity function relating to drug abuse, alcoholism, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, or sickle cell anemia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The following are examples of instances whereby records or information related to alcoholism or drug abuse are covered by the provisions of Sec.

The patient states that continued treatment and follow-up will be obtained from private physicians and VA treatment for the drug abuse is not sought by the patient nor provided or offered by the staff.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> A patient is admitted to the emergency room suffering from a possible drug overdose.
