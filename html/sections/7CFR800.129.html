                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> of this  paragraph, official certificates shall be issued according to Sec.  800.160 and the instructions. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section, only the result of the reinspection service shall be  reported.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Results of material portion sublots. When results of a  reinspection on a material portion do not detect a material error, they  shall be averaged with the original inspection results. For purposes of  this section, a material error is defined as results differing by more  than two standard deviations. The averaged inspection results shall  replace the original inspection results recorded on the official  inspection log. Reinspection results shall replace the original  inspection results recorded on the official inspection log if a material  error is detected. No certificates will be issued unless requested by  the applicant or deemed necessary by official personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reporting review of weighing results. When the review of  weighing service results indicate that the original weighing results  were correct, the applicant will be notified in writing. When the  original weighing service results are incorrect, a corrected weight  certificate or, if applicable, a corrected combination inspection and  Class X weight certificate will be issued according to the provisions of  Sec. 800.165.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required statements on reinspection certificates. Each  reinspection certificate shall show the statements required by this  section, Sec. 800.161, and applicable instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each reinspection certificate must clearly show (i) the term  ``Reinspection'' and (ii) a statement identifying the superseded  certificate. The superseded certificate will be considered null and void  as of the date of the reinspection certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When official grade or official factors, Class X weighing  results, and official criteria are reported on the same certificate, the  reinspection certificate shall show a statement indicating that the  reinspection results are based on official grade, or official factors,  or official criteria and that all other results are those of the  original service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the superseded certificate is in the custody of the agency or  field office, the superseded certificate shall be marked ``Void.'' If  the superseded certificate is not in the custody of the agency or field  office at the time the reinspection certificate is issued, a statement  indicating that the superseded certificate has not been surrendered  shall be shown on the reinspection certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As of the date of issuance of the official certificate, the  superseded certificate for the original service will be void and shall  not be used to represent the grain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When certificates are issued under paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, the reinspection certificate shall show a statement indicating  that the results replaced the original results and that the reinspection  certificate is not valid for trading purposes.
