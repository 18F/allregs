The  tanks may not vent to the atmosphere when attached to an engine. An  integrated or external manually activated device may be included in the  fuel tank design to temporarily relieve pressure before refueling or  connecting the fuel tank to the engine. However, the default setting for  such a vent must be consistent with the requirement in paragraph (c)(2)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> They must remain sealed up to a positive pressure of 24.5 kPa  (3.5 psig); however, they may contain air inlets that open when there is  a vacuum pressure inside the tank. Such fuel tanks may not contain air  outlets that vent to the atmosphere at pressures below 34.5 kPa (5.0  psig).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Detachable fuel lines that are intended for use with portable  marine fuel tanks must have connection points that are self-sealing when  not attached to the engine or fuel tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>  are subject to all the referenced requirements as if these  specifications were mandatory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The following general provisions apply for controlling diurnal  emissions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you are subject to both running loss and diurnal emission  standards, use good engineering judgment to ensure that the emission  controls are compatible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may not use diurnal emission controls that increase the  occurrence of fuel spitback or spillage during in-use refueling. Also,  if you use a carbon canister, you must incorporate design features that  prevent liquid gasoline from reaching the canister during refueling or  as a result of fuel sloshing or fuel expansion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must meet the following provisions from ABYC H-25, July 2010  (incorporated by reference in Sec.  1060.810) with respect to portable  marine fuel tanks:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide information related to the pressure relief method  (25.8.2.1 and 25.8.2.1.1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Perform system testing (25.10 through 25.10.5).
