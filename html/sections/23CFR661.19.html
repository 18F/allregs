                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">To be eligible for replacement, the bridge must be considered  structurally deficient or functionally obsolete and must be in  accordance with 23 CFR part 650.409(a) for bridge replacement. After an  existing bridge is replaced under the IRRBP, it must be taken completely  out of service and removed from the inventory. If the original bridge is  considered historic, it must still be removed from the inventory,  however the Tribe is allowed to request an exemption from the BIA  Division of Transportation (BIADOT) to allow the bridge to remain in  place.</p>
