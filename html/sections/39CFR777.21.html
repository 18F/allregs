                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Planning Prior to Site Selection. When acquisition of a site  under consideration would likely involve displacement of a person  eligible under Sec. 777.13 for relocation assistance, the Postal  Service representative shall prepare a relocation needs and availability  analysis. The Postal Service representative shall include in the  analysis a complete inventory of persons who may be displaced and  specifically identify their needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Planning Subsequent to Site Selection. Subsequent to site  selection, the Postal Service must review the relocation needs and  availability analysis   and establish a specific plan for providing the assistance covered by  these regulations to any eligible displaced persons. It will further  determine the necessity of establishing an on-site relocation office  which would be accessible to displaced persons and would be staffed with  relocation personnel qualified to render all relocation services. The  Postal Service will assure that cost estimates reflect current market  conditions and that funding is available for all relocation assistance  and activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracting for Relocation Services. When the Postal Service  determines it to be advantageous, it may enter into a relocation  assistance service contract with a public agency or private firm having  expertise in relocation assistance. The contract must require the  contractor to follow Postal Service relocation assistance regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice to Vacate, Ninety Day Requirement. Postal Service notices  to vacate must be issued at least 90 days prior to the date the property  must be vacated. Any such notice must be in writing and delivered in  person with receipt acknowledged, or by certified mail, return receipt  requested. The 90-day requirement does not apply to any such notice  issued subsequent to a valid notice to vacate issued by the prior owner  of the property. A 90-day notice may be given with, or such notice may  be combined with, but such notice must not be given before, the notice  of displacement referred to in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Shorter Notice Period, Unusual Circumstances. An occupant may be  required to vacate the property on less than 90 days advance written  notice if the Postal Service determines that a 90-day notice is  impracticable. An example of such a situation is when the person's  continued occupancy of the property would constitute a substantial  danger to the person's health or safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice of Displacement. Normally, a notice of displacement will  be given at the time of acquisition or later. Such notice must not be  given earlier than the time of contracting, except in the case of  acquisitions by eminent domain or by the threat of eminent domain. Such  notice may be given at the time of contracting or between the time of  contracting and the time of acquisition if the Postal Service considers  it wise to start the displacement process then and if, in the judgment  of the Postal Service, it is clear that person will in fact be a  displaced person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of Availability of Advisory Services. The notice of  displacement will state that relocation assistance advisory services  will be available to the displaced person and will designate who will  provide such services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Eviction for cause. Any person occupying real property and not  in unlawful occupancy on the date of initiation of negotiations is  presumed to be entitled to relocation payments and other assistance  unless the Postal Service determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The person received an eviction notice prior to initiation of  negotiations and, as a result of that notice, is later evicted; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The person is evicted after initiation of negotiations for  serious or repeated violation of material terms of the lease or  occupancy agreement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In either case the eviction is not undertaken for the purpose of  evading the obligation to make the relocation payments and other  assistance available.
