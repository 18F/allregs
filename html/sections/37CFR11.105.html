                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A practitioner shall not make an agreement for, charge, or  collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses. The  factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee  include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the  questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service  properly;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance  of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the  practitioner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal  services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The amount involved and the results obtained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The time limitations imposed by the client or by the  circumstances;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The nature and length of the professional relationship with the  client;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The experience, reputation, and ability of the practitioner or  practitioners performing the services; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The scope of the representation and the basis or rate of the fee  and expenses for which the client will be responsible shall be  communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a  reasonable time after commencing the representation, except when the  practitioner will charge a regularly represented client on the same  basis or rate. Any changes in the basis or rate of the fee or expenses  shall also be communicated to the client.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A fee may be contingent on the outcome of the matter for which  the service is rendered, except in a matter in which a contingent fee is  prohibited by law. A contingent fee agreement shall be in a writing  signed by the client and shall state the method by which the fee is to  be determined, including the percentage or percentages that shall accrue  to the practitioner in the event of settlement, trial or appeal;  litigation and other expenses to be deducted from the recovery; and  whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after the contingent  fee is calculated. The agreement must clearly notify the client of any  expenses for which the client will be liable whether or not the client  is the prevailing party. Upon conclusion of a contingent   fee matter, the practitioner shall provide the client with a written  statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery,  showing the remittance to the client and the method of its  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A division of a fee between practitioners who are not in the  same firm may be made only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The division is in proportion to the services performed by each  practitioner or each practitioner assumes joint responsibility for the  representation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The client agrees to the arrangement, including the share each  practitioner will receive, and the agreement is confirmed in writing;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The total fee is reasonable.</p>
