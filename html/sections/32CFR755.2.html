Claims for damage, loss, or destruction of privately owned property caused by a person or persons in the naval service, are payable under Article 139, UCMJ, only if such damage, loss, or destruction is caused by riotous conduct, willful conduct, or acts showing such reckless or wanton disregard of the property rights of others that willful damage or destruction is implied. Acts of the type punishable under Article 109, UCMJ, are cognizable under Article 139, UCMJ. Charges against pay under these regulations shall be made only against the pay of persons shown to have been principal offenders or accessories.</p>
