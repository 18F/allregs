The financial assistance may not be transferred by the applicant for use for another project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If State or local governments raise objections to a proposed project under the intergovernmental review process that are not resolved within 90 days of the Administrator's selection of the application, the Administrator will rescind the selection and written notice to that effect will be sent to the applicant. The Administrator, in his sole discretion may extend the 90 day period if it appears resolution is imminent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> RUS may request additional information to complete the appropriate documents covering financial assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Financial assistance documents.
