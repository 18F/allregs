                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State and local governments. When a State submits a modification to its agreement under section 218 of the Act, which extends coverage to periods prior to 1987, SSA will assign a special identification number to each political subdivision included in that modification. SSA will send the State a Form SSA-214-CD, ``Notice of Identifying Number,'' to inform the State of the special identification number(s). The special number will be used for reporting the pre-1987 wages to SSA. The special number will also be assigned to an interstate instrumentality if pre-1987 coverage is obtained and SSA will send a Form SSA-214-CD to the interstate instrumentality to notify it of the number assigned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Coverage group number for coverage groups. If a State's agreement provides coverage for a State or a political subdivision based on designated proprietary or governmental functions, the State shall furnish a list of those groups. The list shall identify each designated function and the title and business address of the official responsible for filing each designated group's wage report. SSA assigns a coverage group number to each designated group based on the information furnished in the list.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unit numbers for payroll record units. SSA assigns, at a State's request, unit numbers to payroll record units within a State or political subdivision. When a State requests separate payroll record unit numbers, it must furnish the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of each payroll record unit for the coverage group; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The title and business address of the official responsible for each payroll unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unit numbers where contribution amounts are limited--for wages paid prior to 1987. An agreement, or modification of an agreement, may provide for the computation of contributions as prescribed in Sec. 404.1256 for some employees of a political subdivision. In this situation, SSA assigns special unit numbers to the political subdivision to identify those employees. SSA does not assign a special unit number to a political subdivision in which the contributions for all employees are computed as prescribed in Sec. 404.1256.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use. For wages paid prior to 1987, the employer shall show the appropriate SSA-issued identifying number, including any coverage group or payroll record unit number, on records, reports, returns, and claims to report wages, adjustments, and contributions.
