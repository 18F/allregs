                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The president of the NDRB may forward cases for  consideration by the Secretarial Review Authority (SRA). There is no  requirement that the president submit a recommendation when a case is  forwarded to the SRA. If the president makes a recommendation with  respect to the character of or reason for discharge, however, the  recommendation shall be prepared under the guidance in Sec. 724.813b.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Format for recommendation. If a recommendation is provided, it  shall contain the president's view whether there should be a change in  the character of or reason for discharge (or both). If the president  recommends such a change, the particular change to be made shall be  specified. The recommendation shall set forth the president's position  on decisional issues and issues submitted by the applicant under the  following guidance:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adoption of the NDRB's decisional document. The recommendation  may state that the president has adopted the decisional document  prepared by the majority. The president shall ensure that the decisional  document meets the requirements of this enclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adoption of the specific statements from the majority. If the  President adopts the views of the majority only in part, the  recommendation shall cite the specific matter adopted from the majority.  If the president modifies a statement submitted by the majority, the  recommendation shall set forth the modification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Response to issues not included in matter adopted from the  majority. The recommendation shall set forth the following if not  adopted in whole or in part from the majority:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The issues on which the president's recommendation is based.  Each such decisional issue shall be addressed by the president.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The president's response to items submitted as issues by the  applicant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reasons for rejecting the conclusion of the majority with  respect to the decisional document which, if resolved in the applicant's  favor, would have resulted in greater relief for the applicant than that  afforded by the president's recommendation. Such issues shall be  addressed under the principles in Sec. 724.806.</p>
