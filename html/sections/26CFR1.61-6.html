                                Sec. 1.61-6  Gains derived from dealings in property.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Gain realized on the sale or exchange of property is  included in gross income, unless excluded by law. For this purpose  property includes tangible items, such as a building, and intangible  items, such as goodwill. Generally, the gain is the excess of the amount  realized over the unrecovered cost or other basis for the property sold  or exchanged. The specific rules for computing the amount of gain or  loss are contained in section 1001 and the regulations thereunder. When  a part of a larger property is sold, the cost or other basis of the  entire property shall be equitably apportioned among the several parts,  and the gain realized or loss sustained on the part of the entire  property sold is the difference between the selling price and the cost  or other basis allocated to such part. The sale of each part is treated  as a separate transaction and gain or loss shall be computed separately  on each part. Thus, gain or loss shall be determined at the time of sale  of each part and not deferred until the entire property has been  disposed of.   This rule may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A, a dealer in real estate, acquires a 10-acre tract for  $10,000, which he divides into 20 lots. The $10,000 cost must be  equitably apportioned among the lots so that on the sale of each A can  determine his taxable gain or deductible loss.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. B purchases for $25,000 property consisting of a used car  lot and adjoining filling station. At the time, the fair market value of  the filling station is $15,000 and the fair market value of the used car  lot is $10,000. Five years later B sells the filling station for $20,000  at a time when $2,000 has been properly allowed as depreciation thereon.  B's gain on this sale is $7,000, since $7,000 is the amount by which the  selling price of the filling station exceeds the portion of the cost  equitably allocable to the filling station at the time of purchase  reduced by the depreciation properly allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nontaxable exchanges. Certain realized gains or losses on the  sale or exchange of property are not ``recognized'', that is, are not  included in or deducted from gross income at the time the transaction  occurs. Gain or loss from such sales or exchanges is generally  recognized at some later time. Examples of such sales or exchanges are  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certain formations, reorganizations, and liquidations of  corporations, see sections 331, 333, 337, 351, 354, 355, and 361;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain formations and distributions of partnerships, see  sections 721 and 731;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exchange of certain property held for productive use or  investment for property of like kind, see section 1031;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A corporation's exchange of its stock for property, see section  1032;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Certain involuntary conversions of property if replaced, see  section 1033;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Sale or exchange of residence if replaced, see section 1034;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Certain exchanges of insurance policies and annuity contracts,  see section 1035; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Certain exchanges of stock for stock in the same corporation,  see section 1036.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Character of recognized gain. Under Subchapter P, Chapter 1 of  the Code, relating to capital gains and losses, certain gains derived  from dealings in property are treated specially, and under certain  circumstances the maximum rate of tax on such gains is 25 percent, as  provided in section 1201. Generally, the property subject to this  treatment is a ``capital asset'', or treated as a ``capital asset''. For  definition of such assets, see sections 1221 and 1231, and the  regulations thereunder. For some of the rules either granting or denying  this special treatment, see the following sections and the regulations  thereunder:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transactions between partner and partnership, section 707;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sale or exchange of property used in the trade or business and  involuntary conversions, section 1231;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Payment of bonds and other evidences of indebtedness, section  1232;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Gains and losses from short sales, section 1233;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Options to buy or sell, section 1234;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Sale or exchange of patents, section 1235;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Securities sold by dealers in securities, section 1236;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Real property subdivided for sale, section 1237;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Amortization in excess of depreciation, section 1238;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Gain from sale of certain property between spouses or between  an individual and a controlled corporation, section 1239;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Taxability to employee of termination payments, section 1240.</p>
