                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. This section applies to the deenergizing of  transmission and distribution lines and equipment for the purpose of  protecting employees. Conductors and parts of electric equipment that  have been deenergized under procedures other than those required by this  section shall be treated as energized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> System operator. If a system operator is in charge  of the lines or equipment and their means of disconnection, the employer  shall designate one employee in the crew to be in charge of the  clearance and shall comply with all of the requirements of paragraph (c)  of this section in the order specified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No system operator. If no system operator is in charge of the  lines or equipment and their means of disconnection, the employer shall  designate one employee in the crew to be in charge of the clearance and  to perform the functions that the system operator would otherwise  perform under this section. All of the requirements of paragraph (c) of  this section apply, in the order specified, except as provided in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>,  and (c)(5) of this section do not apply. Additionally, the employer does  not need to use the tags required by the remaining provisions of  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Multiple crews. If two or more crews will be working on the same  lines or equipment, then:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The crews shall coordinate their activities under this section  with a single employee in charge of the clearance for all of the crews  and follow the requirements of this section as if all of the employees  formed a single crew, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each crew shall independently comply with this section and, if  there is no system operator in charge of the lines or equipment, shall  have separate tags and coordinate deenergizing and reenergizing the  lines and equipment with the other crews.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Disconnecting means accessible to general public. The employer  shall render any disconnecting means that are accessible to individuals  outside the employer's control (for example, the general public)  inoperable while   the disconnecting means are open for the purpose of protecting  employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deenergizing lines and equipment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Request to deenergize. The  employee that the employer designates pursuant to paragraph (b) of this  section as being in charge of the clearance shall make a request of the  system operator to deenergize the particular section of line or  equipment. The designated employee becomes the employee in charge (as  this term is used in paragraph (c) of this section) and is responsible  for the clearance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Open disconnecting means. The employer shall ensure that all  switches, disconnectors, jumpers, taps, and other means through which  known sources of electric energy may be supplied to the particular lines  and equipment to be deenergized are open. The employer shall render such  means inoperable, unless its design does not so permit, and then ensure  that such means are tagged to indicate that employees are at work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Automatically and remotely controlled switches. The employer  shall ensure that automatically and remotely controlled switches that  could cause the opened disconnecting means to close are also tagged at  the points of control. The employer shall render the automatic or remote  control feature inoperable, unless its design does not so permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Network protectors. The employer need not use the tags mentioned  in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section on a network protector  for work on the primary feeder for the network protector's associated  network transformer when the employer can demonstrate all of the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Every network protector is maintained so that it will  immediately trip open if closed when a primary conductor is deenergized;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Employees cannot manually place any network protector in a  closed position without the use of tools, and any manual override  position is blocked, locked, or otherwise disabled; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The employer has procedures for manually overriding any  network protector that incorporate provisions for determining, before  anyone places a network protector in a closed position, that: The line  connected to the network protector is not deenergized for the protection  of any employee working on the line; and (if the line connected to the  network protector is not deenergized for the protection of any employee  working on the line) the primary conductors for the network protector  are energized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Tags. Tags shall prohibit operation of the disconnecting means  and shall indicate that employees are at work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Test for energized condition. After the applicable requirements  in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section have been followed  and the system operator gives a clearance to the employee in charge, the  employer shall ensure that the lines and equipment are deenergized by  testing the lines and equipment to be worked with a device designed to  detect voltage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Install grounds. The employer shall ensure the installation of  protective grounds as required by Sec. 1926.962.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Consider lines and equipment deenergized. After the applicable  requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7) of this section have  been followed, the lines and equipment involved may be considered  deenergized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Transferring clearances. To transfer the clearance, the employee  in charge (or the employee's supervisor if the employee in charge must  leave the worksite due to illness or other emergency) shall inform the  system operator and employees in the crew; and the new employee in  charge shall be responsible for the clearance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Releasing clearances. To release a clearance, the employee in  charge shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notify each employee under that clearance of the pending release  of the clearance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ensure that all employees under that clearance are clear of the  lines and equipment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ensure that all protective grounds protecting employees under  that clearance have been removed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Report this information to the system operator and then release  the clearance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Person releasing clearance. Only the employee in charge who  requested   the clearance may release the clearance, unless the employer transfers  responsibility under paragraph (c)(9) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Removal of tags. No one may remove tags without the release of  the associated clearance as specified under paragraphs (c)(10) and  (c)(11) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Reenergizing lines and equipment. The employer shall ensure  that no one initiates action to reenergize the lines or equipment at a  point of disconnection until all protective grounds have been removed,  all crews working on the lines or equipment release their clearances,  all employees are clear of the lines and equipment, and all protective  tags are removed from that point of disconnection.</p>
