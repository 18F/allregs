                            <p class="depth0">This section contains the requirements for acceptance and handling of intrastate and interstate job clearance orders seeking workers to perform agricultural or food processing work on a less than year round basis. Orders seeking workers to perform agricultural or food processing work on a year round basis which involves permanent relocation are not subject to the requirements of this subpart. This section, therefore, contains requirements which affect not only applicants who are categorized as MSFWs based on their past employment, but all workers who are recruited through the JS intrastate and interstate clearance systems for less than year round agricultural or food processing work.</p>
