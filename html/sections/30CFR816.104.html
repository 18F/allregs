                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. Thin overburden means insufficient spoil and other  waste materials available from the entire permit area to restore the  disturbed area to its approximate original contour. Insufficient spoil  and other waste materials occur where the overburden thickness times the  swell factor, plus the thickness of other available waste materials, is  less than the combined thickness of the overburden and coal bed prior to  removing the coal, so that after backfilling and grading the surface  configuration of the reclaimed area would not:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Closely resemble the surface configuration of the land prior to  mining; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Blend into and complement the drainage pattern of the  surrounding terrain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Performance standards. Where thin overburden occurs within the  permit area, the permittee at a minimum shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use all spoil and other waste materials available from the  entire permit area to attain the lowest practicable grade, but not more  than the angle of repose; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> through (j) of  this part.
