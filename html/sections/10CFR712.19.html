                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Immediate removal. A supervisor who has a reasonable belief that  an HRP-certified individual is not reliable, based on either a safety or  security concern, must immediately remove that individual from HRP  duties pending a determination of the individual's reliability. A  supervisor also must immediately remove an individual from HRP duties  when requested to do so by the HRP certifying official. The supervisor  must, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Require the individual to stop performing HRP duties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Take action to ensure the individual is denied both escorted and  unescorted access to the material access areas; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide, within 24 hours, to the individual and the HRP  management official, a written reason for these actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The temporary removal of an HRP-certified individual from HRP  duties pending a determination of the individual's reliability is an  interim, precautionary action and does not constitute a determination  that the individual is not fit to perform his or her required duties.  Removal is not, in itself, cause for loss of pay, benefits, or other  changes in employment status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Temporary removal. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an HRP management official receives a  supervisor's written notice of the immediate removal of an HRP-certified  individual, that official must direct the temporary removal of the  individual pending an evaluation and determination of the individual's  reliability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If removal is based on a security concern, the HRP management  official must notify the HRP certifying official and the applicable DOE  personnel security office. The security concern will be resolved under  the criteria and procedures in 10 CFR part 710, subpart A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If removal is based on a concern that is not security related,  the HRP management official must conduct an evaluation of the  circumstances or information that led the supervisor to remove the  individual from HRP duties. The HRP management official must prepare a  written report of the evaluation that includes a determination of the  individual's reliability for continuing HRP certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the HRP management official determines that an individual who  has been temporarily removed continues to meet the requirements for  certification, the HRP management official must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notify the individual's supervisor of the determination and  direct that the individual be allowed to return to HRP duties;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notify the individual; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notify the HRP certifying official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the HRP management official determines that an individual who  has been temporarily removed does not meet the HRP requirements for  certification, the HRP management official must forward the written  report to the HRP certifying official. If the HRP certifying official is  not the Manager, the HRP certifying official must review the written  report and take one of the following actions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Direct that the individual be reinstated and provide written  explanation of the reasons and factual bases for the action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Direct continuation of the temporary removal pending completion  of specified actions (e.g., medical assessment, treatment) to resolve  the concerns about the individual's reliability; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Recommend to the Manager the revocation of the individual's  certification and provide written explanation of the reasons and factual  bases for the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Manager, on receiving the HRP management official's written  report and the HRP certifying official's recommendation (if any), must  take one of the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct reinstatement of the individual and provide written  explanation of the reasons and factual bases for the action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Direct revocation of the individual's HRP certification; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Direct continuation of the temporary removal pending completion  of specified actions (e.g., medical assessment, treatment) to resolve  the concerns about the individual's reliability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the action is revocation, the Manager must provide the  individual a copy of the HRP management official's report. The Manager  may withhold such a report, or portions thereof, to the extent that he  or she determines that the report, or portions thereof, may be exempt  from access by the employee under the Privacy Act or the Freedom of  Information Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If an individual is directed by the Manager to take specified  actions to resolve HRP concerns, he or she must be reevaluated by the  HRP management official and HRP certifying official after those actions  have been completed. After considering the HRP management and HRP  certifying officials' report and recommendation, the Manager must direct  either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reinstatement of the individual; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Revocation of the individual's HRP certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notification of Manager's initial decision. The Manager must  send by certified mail (return receipt requested) a written decision,  including rationale, to the HRP-certified individual whose certification  is revoked. The Manager's decision must be accompanied by notification  to the individual, in writing, of the procedures pertaining to  reconsideration or a hearing on the Manager's decision.</p>
