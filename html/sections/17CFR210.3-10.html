                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Every issuer of a registered security that is  guaranteed and every guarantor of a registered security must file the  financial statements required for a registrant by Regulation S-X.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operation of this rule. Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of  this section are exceptions to the general rule of paragraph (a)(1) of  this section. Only one of these paragraphs can apply to a single issuer  or guarantor. Paragraph (g) of this section is a special rule for  recently acquired issuers or guarantors that overrides each of these  exceptions for a specific issuer or guarantor. Paragraph (h) of this  section defines the following terms used in this section: 100% owned,  full and unconditional, annual   report, quarterly report, no independent assets or operations, minor,  finance subsidiary and operating subsidiary. Paragraph (i) of this  section states the requirements for preparing the condensed  consolidating financial information required by paragraphs (c), (d), (e)  and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (a)(2).</p><p class="depth3">Where paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this section specify  the filing of financial statements of the parent company, the financial  statements of an entity that is not an issuer or guarantor of the  registered security cannot be substituted for those of the parent  company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Foreign private issuers. Where any provision of this section  requires compliance with Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 3-02, a foreign private  issuer may comply by providing financial statements for the periods  specified by Item 8.A of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Finance subsidiary issuer of securities guaranteed by its parent  company. When a finance subsidiary issues securities and its parent  company guarantees those securities, the registration statement, parent  company annual report, or parent company quarterly report need not  include financial statements of the issuer if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The issuer is 100% owned by the parent company guarantor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The guarantee is full and unconditional;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees the  securities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The parent company's financial statements are filed for the  periods specified by Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 and include a  footnote stating that the issuer is a 100%-owned finance subsidiary of  the parent company and the parent company has fully and unconditionally  guaranteed the securities. The footnote also must include the narrative  disclosures specified in paragraphs (i)(9) and (i)(10) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth3">Paragraph (b) is available if a subsidiary issuer satisfies the  requirements of this paragraph but for the fact that, instead of the  parent company guaranteeing the security, the subsidiary issuer co- issued the security, jointly and severally, with the parent company. In  this situation, the narrative information required by paragraph (b)(4)  must be modified accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Operating subsidiary issuer of securities guaranteed by its  parent company. When an operating subsidiary issues securities and its  parent company guarantees those securities, the registration statement,  parent company annual report, or parent company quarterly report need  not include financial statements of the issuer if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The issuer is 100% owned by the parent company guarantor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The guarantee is full and unconditional;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees the  securities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The parent company's financial statements are filed for the  periods specified by Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 and include, in a  footnote, condensed consolidating financial information for the same  periods with a separate column for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The parent company;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The subsidiary issuer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any other subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined  basis;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Consolidating adjustments; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The total consolidated amounts.</p><p class="depth4">Notes to paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth4">1. Instead of the condensed consolidating financial information  required by paragraph (c)(4), the parent company's financial statements  may include a footnote stating, if true, that the parent company has no  independent assets or operations, the guarantee is full and  unconditional, and any subsidiaries of the parent company other than the  subsidiary issuer are minor. The footnote also must include the  narrative disclosures specified in paragraphs (i)(9) and (i)(10) of this  section.</p><p class="depth4">2. If the alternative disclosure permitted by Note 1 to this  paragraph is not applicable because the parent company has independent  assets or operations, the condensed consolidating financial information  described in paragraph (c)(4) may omit the column for ``any other  subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined basis'' if those other  subsidiaries are minor.</p><p class="depth4">3. Paragraph (c) is available if a subsidiary issuer satisfies the  requirements of this paragraph but for the fact that, instead of the  parent company guaranteeing the security, the subsidiary issuer co- issued the security, jointly and severally, with the parent company. In  this situation, the narrative information required by paragraph (i)(8)  of this section must be modified accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subsidiary issuer of securities guaranteed by its parent company  and one or more other subsidiaries of that parent   company. When a subsidiary issues securities and both its parent company  and one or more other subsidiaries of that parent company guarantee  those securities, the registration statement, parent company annual  report, or parent company quarterly report need not include financial  statements of the issuer or any subsidiary guarantor if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The issuer and all subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned by the  parent company guarantor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The guarantees are full and unconditional;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The guarantees are joint and several; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The parent company's financial statements are filed for the  periods specified by Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 and include, in a  footnote, condensed consolidating financial information for the same  periods with a separate column for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The parent company;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The subsidiary issuer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The guarantor subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined  basis;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any other subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined  basis;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Consolidating adjustments; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The total consolidated amounts.</p><p class="depth4">Notes to paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth4">1. Paragraph (d) applies in the same manner whether the issuer is a  finance subsidiary or an operating subsidiary.</p><p class="depth4">2. The condensed consolidating financial information described in  paragraph (d)(4) may omit the column for ``any other subsidiaries of the  parent company on a combined basis'' if those other subsidiaries are  minor.</p><p class="depth4">3. Paragraph (d) is available if a subsidiary issuer satisfies the  requirements of this paragraph but for the fact that, instead of the  parent company guaranteeing the security, the subsidiary issuer co- issued the security, jointly and severally, with the parent company. In  this situation, the narrative information required by paragraph (i)(8)  of this section must be modified accordingly.</p><p class="depth4">4. If all of the requirements in paragraph (d) are satisfied except  that the guarantee of a subsidiary is not joint and several with, as  applicable, the parent company's guarantee or the guarantees of the  parent company and the other subsidiaries, then each subsidiary  guarantor whose guarantee is not joint and several need not include  separate financial statements, but the condensed consolidating financial  information should include a separate column for each guarantor whose  guarantee is not joint and several.</p><p class="depth4">5. Instead of the condensed consolidating financial information  required by paragraph (d)(4), the parent company's financial statements  may include a footnote stating, if true, that the parent company has no  independent assets or operations, the subsidiary issuer is a 100% owned  finance subsidiary of the parent company, the parent company has  guaranteed the securities, all of the parent company's subsidiaries  other than the subsidiary issuer have guaranteed the securities, all of  the guarantees are full and unconditional, and all of the guarantees are  joint and several. The footnote also must include the narrative  disclosures specified in paragraphs (i)(9) and (i)(10) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Single subsidiary guarantor of securities issued by the parent  company of that subsidiary. When a parent company issues securities and  one of its subsidiaries guarantees those securities, the registration  statement, parent company annual report, or parent company quarterly  report need not include financial statements of the subsidiary guarantor  if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The subsidiary guarantor is 100% owned by the parent company  issuer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The guarantee is full and unconditional;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No other subsidiary of that parent guarantees the securities;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The parent company's financial statements are filed for the  periods specified by Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 and include, in a  footnote, condensed consolidating financial information for the same  periods with a separate column for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The parent company;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The subsidiary guarantor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any other subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined  basis;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Consolidating adjustments; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The total consolidated amounts.</p><p class="depth4">Notes to paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth4">1. Paragraph (e) applies in the same manner whether the guarantor is  a finance subsidiary or an operating subsidiary.</p><p class="depth4">2. Instead of the condensed consolidating financial information  required by paragraph (e)(4), the parent company's financial statements  may include a footnote stating, if true, that the parent company has no  independent assets or operations, the guarantee is full and  unconditional, and any subsidiaries of the parent company other than the  subsidiary guarantor are minor. The footnote also must include the  narrative disclosures specified in paragraphs (i)(9) and (i)(10) of this  section.</p><p class="depth4">3. If the alternative disclosure permitted by Note 2 to this  paragraph is not applicable because the parent company has independent  assets or operations, the condensed consolidating financial information  described in paragraph (e)(4) may omit the column for ``any other  subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined basis'' if those other  subsidiaries are minor.</p><p class="depth4">4. If, instead of guaranteeing the subject security, a subsidiary  co-issues the security jointly and severally with its parent company,  this paragraph (e) does not apply. Instead, the appropriate financial  information requirement would depend on whether the subsidiary is a  finance subsidiary or an operating subsidiary. If the subsidiary is a  finance subsidiary, paragraph (b) applies. If the subsidiary is an  operating company, paragraph (c) applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Multiple subsidiary guarantors of securities issued by the  parent company of those subsidiaries. When a parent company issues  securities and more than one of its subsidiaries guarantee those  securities, the registration statement, parent company annual report, or  parent company quarterly report need not include financial statements of  the subsidiary guarantors if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each of the subsidiary guarantors is 100% owned by the parent  company issuer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The guarantees are full and unconditional;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The guarantees are joint and several; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The parent company's financial statements are filed for the  periods specified by Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 and include, in a  footnote, condensed consolidating financial information for the same  periods with a separate column for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The parent company;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The subsidiary guarantors on a combined basis;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any other subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined  basis;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Consolidating adjustments; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The total consolidated amounts.</p><p class="depth4">Notes to paragraph (f):</p><p class="depth4">1. Instead of the condensed consolidating financial information  required by paragraph (f)(4), the parent company's financial statements  may include a footnote stating, if true, that the parent company has no  independent assets or operations, the guarantees are full and  unconditional and joint and several, and any subsidiaries of the parent  company other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor. The footnote  also must include the narrative disclosures specified in paragraphs  (i)(9) and (i)(10) of this section.</p><p class="depth4">2. If the alternative disclosure permitted by Note 1 to this  paragraph is not applicable because the parent company has independent  assets or operations, the condensed consolidating financial information  described in paragraph (f)(4) may omit the column for ``any other  subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined basis'' if those other  subsidiaries are minor.</p><p class="depth4">3. If any of the subsidiary guarantees is not joint and several with  the guarantees of the other subsidiaries, then each subsidiary guarantor  whose guarantee is not joint and several need not include separate  financial statements, but the condensed consolidating financial  information must include a separate column for each subsidiary guarantor  whose guarantee is not joint and several.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Recently acquired subsidiary issuers or subsidiary guarantors.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Securities Act registration statement of the parent company must  include the financial statements specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this  section for any subsidiary that otherwise meets the conditions in  paragraph (c), (d), (e) or (f) of this section for omission of separate  financial statements if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subsidiary has not been included in the audited consolidated  results of the parent company for at least nine months of the most  recent fiscal year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The net book value or purchase price, whichever is greater, of  the subsidiary is 20% or more of the principal amount of the securities  being registered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Financial statements required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Audited financial statements for a subsidiary described in  paragraph (g)(1) of this section must be filed for the subsidiary's most  recent fiscal year preceding the acquisition. In addition, unaudited  financial statements must be filed for any interim periods specified in  Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The financial statements must conform to the requirements of  Regulation S-X (Sec. Sec. 210.1-01 through 12-29), except that  supporting schedules need not be filed. If the subsidiary is a foreign  business, financial statements of the subsidiary meeting the  requirements of Item 17 of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f) will satisfy this  item.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Instructions to paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The significance test of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section  should be computed using net book value of the subsidiary as of the most  recent fiscal year end preceding the acquisition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information required by this paragraph (g) is not required to  be included in an annual report or quarterly report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Acquisitions of a group of subsidiary issuers or subsidiary  guarantors that are related prior to their acquisition shall be  aggregated for purposes of applying the 20% test in paragraph (g)(1)(ii)  of this section. Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be related prior to  their acquisition if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> They are under common control or management;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The acquisition of one subsidiary is conditioned on the  acquisition of each subsidiary; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The acquisition of each subsidiary is conditioned on a single  common event.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A subsidiary is ``100% owned'' if all of its outstanding voting  shares are owned, either directly or indirectly, by its parent company.  A subsidiary not in corporate form is 100% owned if the sum of all  interests are owned, either directly or indirectly, by its parent  company other than:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Securities that are guaranteed by its parent and, if applicable,  other 100%-owned subsidiaries of its parent; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Securities that guarantee securities issued by its parent and,  if applicable, other 100%-owned subsidiaries of its parent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A guarantee is ``full and unconditional,'' if, when an issuer of  a guaranteed security has failed to make a scheduled payment, the  guarantor is obligated to make the scheduled payment immediately and, if  it doesn't, any holder of the guaranteed security may immediately bring  suit directly against the guarantor for payment of all amounts due and  payable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Annual report refers to an annual report on Form 10-K or Form  20-F (Sec. 249.310 or Sec. 249.220f of this chapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Quarterly report refers to a quarterly report on Form 10-Q  (Sec. 249.308a of this chapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A parent company has no independent assets or operations if each  of its total assets, revenues, income from continuing operations before  income taxes, and cash flows from operating activities (excluding  amounts related to its investment in its consolidated subsidiaries) is  less than 3% of the corresponding consolidated amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A subsidiary is minor if each of its total assets, stockholders'  equity, revenues, income from continuing operations before income taxes,  and cash flows from operating activities is less than 3% of the parent  company's corresponding consolidated amount.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (h)(6).</p><p class="depth3">When considering a group of subsidiaries, the definition applies to  each subsidiary in that group individually and to all subsidiaries in  that group in the aggregate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A subsidiary is a finance subsidiary if it has no assets,  operations, revenues or cash flows other than those related to the  issuance, administration and repayment of the security being registered  and any other securities guaranteed by its parent company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A subsidiary is an operating subsidiary if it is not a finance  subsidiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Instructions for preparation of condensed consolidating  financial information required by paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Follow the general guidance in Sec. 210.10-01 for the form and  content for condensed financial statements and present the financial  information in sufficient detail to allow investors to determine the  assets, results of operations and cash flows of each of the  consolidating groups;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The financial information should be audited for the same periods  that the parent company financial statements are required to be audited;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The parent company column should present investments in all  subsidiaries based upon their proportionate share of the subsidiary's  net assets;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The parent company's basis shall be ``pushed down'' to the  applicable subsidiary columns to the extent that push down would be  required or permitted in separate financial statements of the  subsidiary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All subsidiary issuer or subsidiary guarantor columns should  present the   following investments in subsidiaries under the equity method:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Non-guarantor subsidiaries;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subsidiary issuers or subsidiary guarantors that are not 100%  owned or whose guarantee is not full and unconditional;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subsidiary guarantors whose guarantee is not joint and several  with the guarantees of the other subsidiaries; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Subsidiary guarantors with differences in domestic or foreign  laws that affect the enforceability of the guarantees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Provide a separate column for each subsidiary issuer or  subsidiary guarantor that is not 100% owned, whose guarantee is not full  and unconditional, or whose guarantee is not joint and several with the  guarantees of other subsidiaries. Inclusion of a separate column does  not relieve that issuer or guarantor from the requirement to file  separate financial statements under paragraph (a) of this section.  However, paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section will provide this  relief if the particular paragraph is satisfied except that the  guarantee is not joint and several;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Provide separate columns for each guarantor by legal  jurisdiction if differences in domestic or foreign laws affect the  enforceability of the guarantees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Include the following disclosure, if true:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each subsidiary issuer or subsidiary guarantor is 100% owned by  the parent company;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All guarantees are full and unconditional; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where there is more than one guarantor, all guarantees are  joint and several;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Disclose any significant restrictions on the ability of the  parent company or any guarantor to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by  dividend or loan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Provide the disclosures prescribed by Sec. 210.4-08(e)(3) with  respect to the subsidiary issuers and subsidiary guarantors;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The disclosure:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> May not omit any financial and narrative information about each  guarantor if the information would be material for investors to evaluate  the sufficiency of the guarantee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Shall include sufficient information so as to make the  financial information presented not misleading; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Need not repeat information that would substantially duplicate  disclosure elsewhere in the parent company's consolidated financial  statements; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Where the parent company's consolidated financial statements  are prepared on a comprehensive basis other than U.S. Generally Accepted  Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards as  issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, reconcile the  information in each column to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles to the extent necessary to allow investors to evaluate the  sufficiency of the guarantees. The reconciliation may be limited to the  information specified by Item 17 of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this  chapter).
