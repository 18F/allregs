Borrowers must set tenant contributions to rent at the highest of the following standards but never more than the note rent:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Thirty percent of monthly adjusted income;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ten percent of gross monthly income;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An amount equal to the portion of an assistance payment specifically designated to meet the household's shelter costs if the household is receiving assistance payments from a public agency; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The basic rent, unless RHS rental assistance is provided to the household.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tenant contribution surcharge. Tenants in a Plan I housing project with incomes above the eligibility standards set in Sec. 3560.152(a)(1) must pay a 25 percent surcharge in addition to note rent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustment of tenant contribution. Borrowers must adjust the tenant contribution whenever there is a change in tenant household status or income sufficient to generate a revised tenant certification in accordance with Sec. 3560.152(e) or an Agency approved rent or utility allowance change that affects the tenant contribution amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Overage. If a tenant's tenant contribution is higher than basic rent, borrowers must remit to the Agency the rent collected in excess of the basic rent and up to the note rent.</p>
