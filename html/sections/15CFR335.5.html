The license is subject to the surrender and reallocation provisions in Sec. 335.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A license may be exercised only for fabric entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, during the Tariff Rate Quota Year specified in the license. A license will be debited on the basis of date of entry for consumption or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A Licensee may import fabric certified by the importer as suitable for use in making suits, suit-type jackets,

or trousers under the appropriate Tariff Rate Quota as specified in the license (i.e., under the Tariff Rate Quota for fabric of worsted wool with average fiber diameters greater than 18.5 micron or the Tariff Rate Quota for fabric of worsted wool with average fiber diameters of 18.5 micron or less) up to the quantity specified in the license subject to the Tariff Rate Quota duty rate.
