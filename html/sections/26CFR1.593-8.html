                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. In the case of a taxpayer described in Sec. 1.593- 4, if the amount of pre-1963 reserves allocated (under paragraph  (b)(3)(i) of Sec. 1.593-7) to the opening balance of the reserve for  losses on qualifying real property loans is less than an amount equal to  the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The total amount of qualifying real property loans outstanding  at the close of December 31, 1962, multiplied by 3 percent, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this paragraph.

For purposes of this  section and Sec. 1.593-7, the term pre-1952 surplus means an amount  equal to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sum of the taxpayer's surplus, undivided profits, and  reserves determined (under the principles of paragraph (d)(2) of  Sec. 1.593-1) as of the close of the taxpayer's last taxable year  beginning before January 1, 1952 (including any amount acquired from  another taxpayer), minus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of any impairments of such sum (as determined under  paragraph (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reduction for certain excludable interest. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount  otherwise determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may, at  the option of the taxpayer, be reduced by the portion, if any, of such  amount which is attributable to interest which would have been  excludable from gross income of such taxpayer under section 22(b)(4) of   the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (relating to interest on governmental  obligations) or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, had  such taxpayer been subject, when such interest was received or accrued,  to the income tax imposed by such Code or prior revenue laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the  portion of the amount otherwise determined under subparagraph (1) of  this paragraph which is attributable to interest which would have been  excludable from gross income shall be determined by multiplying such  amount by the ratio which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The total amount of such excludable interest for the period  before the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after December 31,  1951, bears to</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The total amount of the taxpayer's gross income, plus the total  amount of such excludable interest, for such period   If the amount determined under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph  includes any amount acquired from another taxpayer, then the gross  income and excludable interest of the taxpayer for the period before its  first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1951, shall include the  gross income and excludable interest (for the same period) of such other  taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Impairment of surplus, undivided profits, and reserves--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  General rule.

In the case of a taxable year beginning before  January 1, 1963, and ending after December 31, 1962, the part of such  year which occurs before January 1, 1963, shall be considered to be a  taxable year for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rules for applying subparagraph (1).

For such limited purpose,  such portion shall be deemed to remain in, and constitute a part of, the  reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans. For all other  purposes, such portion will retain its character as part of the  taxpayer's pre-1952 surplus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Example. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Facts. X Corporation, a mutual savings bank organized  in 1934, makes its returns on the basis of the calendar year and the  reserve method of accounting for bad debts. For the taxable years 1934  through 1951, X's gross income was $2.7 million, in addition to which X  received $300,000 of interest which would have been excludable from  gross income under section 22(b)(4) of the Internal   Revenue Code of 1939, or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue  laws, if X had been subject to the income tax imposed by such Code or  prior revenue laws when such interest was received. At the close of  1951, the sum of X's surplus, undivided profits, and reserves was  $650,000. At the close of 1954, X had pre-1963 reserves of $10,000, and  surplus, undivided profits, and reserves of $630,000. At the close of  1955, X had pre-1963 reserves of $15,000, and surplus, undivided  profits, and reserves of $625,000. At the close of 1962, X had pre-1963  reserves of $55,000, nonqualifying loans of $4 million, and qualifying  real property loans of $10 million. It is assumed that, under  Sec. 1.166-4, $16,000 would constitute a reasonable addition to the  reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans for a period in which such  loans increased from zero to $4 million and $20,000 would constitute a  reasonableaddition to the reserve for losses on qualifying real property  loans for a period in which such loans increased from zero to $10  million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Impairment of surplus, undivided profits, and reserves for 1954.  The sum of X's surplus, undivided profits, and reserves at the close of  1951 was impaired during 1954 by $30,000, computed as follows:  Sum of surplus, undivided profits, and reserves at close of     $650,000</p><p class="depth0">1951....................................................... Less:</p><p class="depth0">Sum of surplus, undivided profits, and reserves at close       620,000</p><p class="depth0">of 1954, excluding pre-1963 reserves at close of such</p><p class="depth0">year ($630,000 minus $10,000)............................</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">30,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Impairment of surplus, undivided profits, and reserves for 1955.  The sum of X's surplus, undivided profits, and reserves at the close of  1951 was further impaired during 1955 by $10,000, computed as follows:  Sum of surplus, undivided profits, and reserves at close of     $620,000</p><p class="depth0">1951, decreased by amount of 1954 impairment ($650,000</p><p class="depth0">minus $30,000)............................................. Less:</p><p class="depth0">Sum of surplus, undivided profits, and reserves at close       610,000</p><p class="depth0">of 1955, excluding pre-1963 reserves at close of such</p><p class="depth0">year ($625,000 minus $15,000)............................</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">10,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Pre-1952 surplus. X's pre-1952 surplus is $549,000, computed as  follows:  Sum of surplus, undivided profits and reserves      $650,000</p><p class="depth0">at close of 1951............................... Less:</p><p class="depth0">Sum of impairments for 1954 and 1955 ($30,000       40,000</p><p class="depth0">plus $10,000)................................</p><p class="depth0">-------------</p><p class="depth0">..........    $610,000 Less:</p><p class="depth0">Portion of such $610,000 which is attributable  ..........      61,000</p><p class="depth0">to excludable interest ($610,000 multiplied</p><p class="depth0">by $300,000/$3 million)......................</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">..........     549,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Allocation of pre-1963 reserves to reserve for losses on  nonqualifying loans and to reserve for losses on qualifying real  property loans. Of the $55,000 of pre-1963 reserves at the close of  1962, $16,000 (the amount which would constitute a reasonable addition  to the reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans for a period in which  such loans increased from zero to $4 million) shall be allocated to, and  constitute the opening balance of, the reserve for losses on  nonqualifying loans, and the balance of $39,000 ($55,000 minus $16,000)  shall be allocated to, and constitute a part of the opening balance of,  the reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Allocation of pre-1952 surplus to reserve for losses on  qualifying real property loans. X's pre-1963 reserves are not sufficient  to bring the opening balance of the reserve for losses on qualifying  real property loans to $300,000, which is an amount equal to the greater  of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> $300,000 (i.e., $10 million of qualifying real property loans  outstanding at the close of 1962, multiplied by 3 percent), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> $20,000 (the amount which would constitute a reasonable  addition to the reserve for losses on such loans under Sec. 1.166-4 for  a period in which the amount of such loans increased from zero to the  $10 million).   Therefore, $261,000 ($300,000 minus $39,000) of X's pre-1952 surplus of  $549,000 shall be deemed to be included in the opening balance of such  reserve in order to increase such opening balance to $300,000.
