Critical habitat includes the stream channels within the designated stream reaches, and includes a lateral extent as defined by the ordinary high-water line (33 CFR 329.11). In areas where the ordinary high-water line has not been defined, the lateral extent will be defined by the bankfull elevation. Bankfull elevation is the level at which water begins to leave the channel and move into the floodplain and is reached at a discharge which generally has a recurrence interval of 1 to 2 years on the annual flood series. Critical habitat in estuaries (e.g. San Francisco-San Pablo-Suisun Bay, Humboldt Bay, and Morro Bay) is defined by the perimeter of the water body as displayed on standard 1:24,000 scale topographic maps or the elevation of extreme high water, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Primary constituent elements. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements essential for the conservation of these ESUs are those sites and habitat components that support one or more life stages, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Freshwater spawning sites with water quantity and quality conditions and substrate supporting spawning, incubation and larval development;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Freshwater rearing sites with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Water quantity and floodplain connectivity to form and maintain physical habitat conditions and support juvenile growth and mobility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Water quality and forage supporting juvenile development; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Natural cover such as shade, submerged and overhanging large wood, log jams and beaver dams, aquatic vegetation, large rocks and boulders, side channels, and undercut banks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Freshwater migration corridors free of obstruction and excessive predation with water quantity and quality conditions and natural cover such as submerged and overhanging large wood, aquatic vegetation, large rocks and boulders, side channels, and undercut banks supporting juvenile and adult mobility and survival.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Estuarine areas free of obstruction and excessive predation with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Water quality, water quantity, and salinity conditions supporting juvenile and adult physiological transitions between fresh- and saltwater;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Natural cover such as submerged and overhanging large wood, aquatic vegetation, large rocks and boulders, side channels; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Juvenile and adult forage, including aquatic invertebrates and fishes, supporting growth and maturation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exclusion of Indian lands.
