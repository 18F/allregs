                            <p class="depth0">Waiting lists are maintained for each designated refugee group of  special humanitarian concern. Each applicant whose application is  accepted for filing by USCIS shall be registered as of the date of  filing. The date of filing is the priority date for purposes of case  control. Refugees or groups of refugees may be selected from these lists  in a manner that will best support the policies and interests of the  United States. The Secretary may adopt appropriate criteria for  selecting the refugees and assignment of processing priorities for each  designated group based upon such considerations as reuniting families,  close association with the United States, compelling humanitarian  concerns, and public interest factors.
