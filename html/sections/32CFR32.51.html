Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the audit requirements as delineated in Sec. 32.26.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The award terms and conditions shall prescribe the frequency with which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the award year; quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 calendar days after the reporting period. DoD Components may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. However, unit costs are generally inappropriate for research (see Sec. 32.21 (a) and (b)(4)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Recipients shall immediately notify the grants officer of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> DoD Components' representatives may make site visits, as needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> DoD Components shall comply with applicable clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance data from recipients.</p>
