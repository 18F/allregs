These products are listed in Annex II. Registered users will be able to obtain steel import licenses on the Steel Import Monitoring and Analysis (SIMA) System Web site. This Web site contains two sections related to import licensing--the online registration system and the automatic steel import license issuance system.

Information gathered from these licenses will be aggregated and posted on the import monitoring section of the SIMA system Web site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A single license may cover multiple products as long as certain information on the license (e.g., importer, exporter, manufacturer and country of origin) remains the same. However, separate licenses for steel entered under a single entry will be required if the information differs. As a result, a single Customs entry may require more than one steel import license. The applicable license(s) must cover the total quantity of steel entered and should cover the same information provided on the Customs entry summary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Entries for consumption. All entries for consumption of covered steel products, other than the exception for ``informal entries'' listed in paragraph (d) of this section, will require an import license prior to the filing of Customs entry summary documents. The license number(s) must be reported on the entry summary (Customs Form 7501) at the time of filing. There is no requirement to present physical copies of the license forms at the time of entry summary. However, copies must be maintained in accordance with Customs' normal requirements. Entry summaries submitted without the required license number(s) will be considered incomplete and will be subject to liquidated damages for violation of the bond condition requiring timely completion of entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Foreign Trade Zone entries. All shipments of covered steel products into a foreign trade zones (FTZ), known as FTZ admissions, will require an import license prior to the filing of FTZ admission documents. The license number(s) must be reported on the application for FTZ admission and/or status designation (Customs form 214) at the time of filing. There is no requirement to present physical copies of the license forms at the time of FTZ admission; however, copies must be maintained in accordance with Customs' normal requirements. FTZ admission documents submitted without the required license number(s) will not be considered complete and will be subject to liquidated damages for violation of the bond condition requiring timely completion of admission. A further steel license will not be required for shipments from zones into the commerce of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Informal entries. No import license shall be required on informal entries of covered steel products, such as merchandise valued at less than $2,000. This exemption applies to informal entries only, imports of steel valued at less than $2,000 that are part of a formal entry will require a license. For additional information, refer to 19 CFR 143.21 through 143.28.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other non-consumption entries. Import licenses are not required on temporary importation bond (TIB) entries, transportation and exportation (T&E;) entries or entries into a bonded warehouse. Covered steel products withdrawn for consumption from a bonded warehouse will require a license at the entry summary.</p>
