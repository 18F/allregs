(If both spouse and divorced spouse annuities are payable, the reduction amount is divided and applied in equal amounts to both the spouse and divorced spouse tier I benefits.) The employee tier I is reduced by the difference between the total reduction amount, described in Sec. 226.71 of this part, and the reduction in the spouse and divorced spouse tier I benefits.</p>
