Such a statement must reflect the Toxicity Category(ies) of the diluted product, based upon data for the route of exposure (or calculations if appropriate). If the labeling provides for a range of use dilutions, only that use dilution representing the highest concentration allowed by labeling may be used as the basis for a statement pertaining to the diluted product.
