However, the CSB will provide a copy of such indexes to a member of the public upon request, at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication and mailing, if sending records by other than ordinary mail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The CSB maintains a public reading room at its headquarters: 2175 K Street, NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC 20037-1809.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Copying. The cost of copying information available in the offices of the CSB shall be imposed on a requester in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec.  1601.30 through 1601.33.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The CSB also makes reading room records available electronically through the agency's World Wide Web site (which can be found at http://www.csb.gov).
