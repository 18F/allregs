                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The purpose of this part is to set forth the  methodology and formulas by which the Administrator of the RUS allocates  program funds to the States. (The term ``State'' means any of the States  of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or  possession of the United States, or the Western Pacific Areas.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The formulas in this part are used to allocate program loan and  grant   funds to Rural Development State offices so that the overall mission of  the Agency can be carried out. Considerations used when developing the  formulas include enabling legislation, congressional direction, and  administration policies. Allocation formulas ensure that program  resources are available on an equal basis to all eligible individuals  and organizations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The actual amounts of funds, as computed by the methodology and  formulas contained herein, allocated to a State for a funding period,  are distributed to each State office. The allocated amounts are  available for review in any Rural Development State office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amount available for allocations. Funds  appropriated or otherwise made available to the Agency for use in  authorized programs. On occasion, the allocation of funds to States may  not be practical for a particular program due to funding or  administrative constraints. In these cases, funds will be controlled by  the National Office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Basic formula criteria, data source and weight. Basic formulas  are used to calculate a basic State factor as a part of the methodology  for allocating funds to the States. The formulas take a number of  criteria that reflect the funding needs for a particular program and  through a normalization and weighting process for each of the criteria  calculate the basic State factor (SF). The data sources used for each  criteria are believed to be the most current and reliable information  that adequately quantifies the criterion. The weight, expressed as a  percentage, gives a relative value to the importance of each of the  criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Basic formula allocation. The result of multiplying the amount  available for allocation less the total of any amounts held in reserve  or distributed by base or administrative allocation times the basic  State factor for each State. The basic formula allocation (BFA) for an  individual State is equal to:  BFA=(Amount available for allocation-NO reserve-total base and  administrative allocations)xSF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transition formula. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A formula based on a proportional amount  of previous year allocation used to maintain program continuity by  preventing large fluctuations in individual State allocations. The  transition formula limits allocation shifts to any particular State in  the event of changes from year to year of the basic formula, the basic  criteria, or the weights given the criteria. The transition formula  first checks whether the current year's basic formula allocation is  within the transition range (plus or minus 20 percentage points of the  proportional amount of the previous year's BFA). The formula follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19JN97.000</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the current year's State BFA is not within the transition  range in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the State formula  allocation is changed to the amount of the transition range limit  closest to the BFA amount. After having performed this transition  adjustment for each State, the sum of the funds allocated to all States  will differ from the amount of funds available for BFA. This difference,  whether a positive or negative amount, is distributed to all States  receiving a formula allocation by multiplying the difference by the SF.  The end result is the transition formula allocation. The transition  range will not exceed 40% (plus or minus 20%), but when a smaller range  is used it will be stated in the individual program section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Base allocation. An amount that may be allocated to each State  dependent upon the particular program to provide the opportunity for  funding at least one typical loan or grant in each Rural Development  State office. The amount of the base allocation may be determined by  criteria other than that used in the basic formula allocation such as  Agency historic data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Administrative allocations.Allocations made by the Administrator  in cases where basic formula criteria information is not available. This  form of allocation may be used when the Administrator determines the  program objectives cannot be adequately met with a formula allocation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Reserve.An amount retained under the National Office control for  each loan and grant program to provide flexibility in meeting situations  of unexpected or justifiable need occurring during the fiscal year. The  Administrator may make distributions from this reserve to any State when  it is determined necessary to meet a program need or Agency objective.  The Administrator may retain additional amounts to fund authorized  demonstration programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Pooling of funds. A technique used to ensure that available  funds are used in an effective, timely and efficient manner. At the time  of pooling those funds within a State's allocation for the fiscal year  or portion of the fiscal year, depending on the type of pooling, that  have not been obligated by the State are placed in the National Office  reserve. The Administrator will establish the pooling dates for each  affected program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mid-year: Mid-year pooling occurs near the midpoint of the  fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Year-end: Year-end pooling usually occurs near the first of  August.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Emergency: The Administrator may pool funds at any time that  it is determined the conditions upon the initial allocation was based  have changed to such a degree that it is necessary to pool funds in  order to efficiently carry out the Agency mission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Availability of the allocation. Program funds are made available  to the Agency on a quarterly basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Suballocation by the Rural Development State Director. The  State Director may be directed or given the option of suballocating the  State allocation to processing offices. When suballocating the State  Director may retain a portion of the funds in a State office reserve to  provide flexibility in situations of unexpected or justified need. When  performing a suballocation the State Director will use the same formula,  criteria and weights as used by the National Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Water and waste disposal loans and grants--(1) Amount available  for allocations. See paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The criteria used in the basic formula are:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> State's percentage of national rural population will be 50  percent.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> State's percentage of national rural population with incomes  below the poverty level will be 25 percent.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> State's percentage of national nonmetropolitan unemployment will  be 25 percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section x 25 percent) +  (criterion in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section x 25 percent)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section.  States receiving administrative allocations do not receive formula  allocations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> of this section. The  percentage range for the transition formula equals 30 percent (plus or  minus 15%).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> of this section. States  receiving administrative allocations do not receive base allocations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> of this section.  States participating in the formula and base allocation procedures do  not receive administrative allocations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> of this section. Any State may  request reserve funds by forwarding a request to the National Office.  Generally, a request for additional funds will not be   honored unless the State has insufficient funds to obligate the loan  requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> of this section. Funds  are generally pooled at mid-year and year-end. Pooled funds will be  placed in the National Office reserve and will be made available  administratively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> of this  section. The allocation of funds is made available for States to  obligate on an annual basis although the Office of Management and Budget  apportions it to the Agency on a quarterly basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> of  this section. The State Director has the option to suballocate funds to  processing offices.</p>
