                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General criteria for the underground facility. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  orientation, geometry, layout, and depth of the underground facility,  and the design of any engineered barriers that are part of the  underground facility shall contribute to the containment and isolation  of radionuclides.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The underground facility shall be designed so that the effects  of credible disruptive events during the period of operations, such as  flooding, fires and explosions, will not spread through the facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Flexibility of design. The underground facility shall be  designed with sufficient flexibility to allow adjustments where  necessary to accommodate specific site conditions identified through in  situ monitoring, testing, or excavation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Retrieval of waste. The underground facility shall be designed  to permit retrieval of waste in accordance with the performance  objectives of Sec. 60.111.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Control of water and gas. The design of the underground facility  shall provide for control of water or gas intrusion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Underground openings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Openings in the underground facility  shall be designed so that operations can be carried out safely and the  retrievability option maintained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Openings in the underground facility shall be designed to reduce  the potential for deleterious rock movement or fracturing of overlying  or surrounding rock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Rock excavation. The design of the underground facility shall  incorporate excavation methods that will limit the potential for  creating a preferential pathway for groundwater to contact the waste  packages or radionuclide migration to the accessible environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Underground facility ventilation. The ventilation system shall  be designed to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Control the transport of radioactive particulates and gases  within and releases from the underground facility in accordance with the  performance objectives of Sec. 60.111(a),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assure the ability to perform essential safety functions  assuming occurrence of design basis events.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Separate the ventilation of excavation and waste emplacement  areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Engineered barriers. Engineered barriers shall be designed to  assist the geologic setting in meeting the performance objectives for  the period following permanent closure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Thermal loads. The underground facility shall be designed so  that the performance objectives will be met taking into account the  predicted thermal and thermomechanical response of the host rock, and  surrounding strata, groundwater system.
