When the employer incurs liability for the  taxes imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act with respect to  any such cash remuneration which he did not previously expect would be  subject to the taxes, the amount of any such cash remuneration not  previously made a matter of record shall be determined by the employer  to the best of his knowledge and belief.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The amount of employee tax, or any amount equivalent to  employee tax, collected with respect to such cash remuneration and the  calendar month in which collected.
