Quick closeout procedures (see 42.708) should be used, when appropriate, to reduce administrative costs and to enable deobligation of excess funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A contract file shall not be closed if (1) the contract is in litigation or under appeal, or (2) in the case of a termination, all termination actions have not been completed.
