                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes, provided the plan is a defined benefit plan. If the employee  received a distribution of all or part of the accrued benefit from a  defined benefit plan in connection with his or her service in the  uniformed services before he or she became reemployed, he or she must be  allowed to repay the withdrawn amounts when he or she is reemployed. The  amount the employee must repay includes any interest that would have  accrued had the monies not been withdrawn. The employee must be allowed  to repay these amounts during a time period starting with the date of  reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length of the  employee's immediate past period of uniformed service, with the  repayment period not to exceed five years (or such longer time as may be  agreed to between the employer and the employee), provided the employee  is employed with the post-service employer during this period.</p>
