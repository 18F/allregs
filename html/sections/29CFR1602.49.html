                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any personnel or employment record (including but not  necessarily limited to requests for reasonable accommodation,  application forms submitted by applicants and other records having to do  with hiring, promotion, tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, or  termination, rates of pay or other   terms of compensation, and selection for training) made or kept by an  institution of higher education shall be preserved by such institution  of higher education for a period of two years from the date of the  making of the personnel action or record involved, whichever occurs  later. In the case of the involuntary termination of an employee, the  personnel records of the individual terminated shall be kept for a  period of two years from the date of termination. Where a charge of  discrimination has been filed, or a civil action brought against an  institution of higher education by the Commission or the Attorney  General, the respondent shall preserve similarly at the central  administrative office of the institution of higher education, at the  central office of a separate campus or branch, or at the individual  school which is the subject of the charge or action, where more  convenient, all personnel records relevant to the charge or action until  final disposition thereof. The term ``personnel records relevant to the  charge,'' for example, would include personnel or employment records  relating to the person claiming to be aggrieved and to all other  employees holding positions similar to that held or sought by the person  claiming to be aggrieved; it would also include application forms or  test papers completed by an unsuccessful applicant and by all other  candidates for the same position as that for which the person claiming  to be aggrieved applied and was rejected. The date of ``final  disposition of the charge or the action'' means the date of expiration  of the statutory period within which a person claiming to be aggrieved  may bring an action in the United States District Court, or, where an  action is brought against an institution of higher education by a person  claiming to be aggrieved, the Commission, or the Attorney General, the  date on which such litigation is terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not  apply to application forms and other preemployment records of non- student applicants for positions known to non-student applicants to be  of a temporary or seasonal nature.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  3046-0040)  [40 FR 25188, June 12, 1975, as amended at 46 FR 63268, Dec. 31, 1981;  56 FR 35756, July 26, 1991]</p>
