                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(E), USAID is  authorized to provide appropriate incentives to encourage subcontracting  opportunities for small business consistent with the efficient and  economical performance of the contract. This authority is limited to  negotiated procurements. (48 CFR) FAR 19.202-1 provides additional  guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Costs incurred by a Mentor to provide developmental assistance,  as described in 719.273-8 to fulfill the terms of their agreement(s)  with a Protege firm(s), are not reimbursable as a direct cost under a  USAID contract. If USAID is the mentor's responsible audit agency under  (48 CFR) FAR 42.703-1, USAID will consider these costs in determining  indirect cost rates. If USAID is not the responsible audit agency,  mentors are encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with their  responsible audit agency on the treatment of such costs when determining  indirect cost rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to subparagraph (b) above, contracting officers may  give Mentors evaluation credit under (48 CFR) FAR 15.101-1  considerations for subcontracts awarded pursuant to their Mentor-Protege  Agreements and their subcontracting plans. Therefore:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contracting officers may evaluate subcontracting plans  containing Mentor-Protege arrangements more favorably than  subcontracting plans without Mentor-Protege Agreements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(v)</em> and determining contractor responsibility (48 CFR)  19.705-5(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> OSDBU Mentoring Award. A non-monetary award will be presented  annually to the Mentoring firm providing the most effective  developmental support of a Protege. The Mentor-Protege Program Manager  will recommend an award winner to the Director of the Office of Small  and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> OSDBU Mentor-Protege Annual Conference. At the conclusion of  each year in the Mentor-Protege Program, Mentor firms will be invited to  brief contracting officers, program leaders, office directors and other  guests on Program progress.
