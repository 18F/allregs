                            <p class="depth0">Direct lenders shall be responsible for the servicing of the loans  that they make. However, loan participation agreements may designate  specific loan servicing efforts to be accomplished by a participating  institution. Each direct lender shall adopt loan servicing policies and  procedures to assure that loans will be serviced fairly and equitably  for the borrower while minimizing the risk for the lender. Procedures  shall include specific plans that help preserve the quality of sound  loans and that help correct credit deficiencies as they develop.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Farm Credit Bank shall provide guidelines for the servicing  of loans by the Federal land bank associations. The servicing may be  accomplished either under the direct supervision of the bank or under  delegated authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The servicing of loans which are participated in by Farm Credit  System institutions shall be in accordance with Sec. 614.4325.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the development of loan servicing policies and procedures,  the following criteria shall be included:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Term loans. The objective shall be to provide borrowers with  prompt and efficient service with respect to actions in such areas as  personal liability, partial release of security, insurance requirements  or adjustments, loan divisions or transfers, or conditional payments.  Procedures shall provide for adequate inspections, reanalyses,  reappraisals, controls on payment of insurance and taxes (and for  payment when necessary), and prompt exercise   of legal options to preserve the lender's collateral position or guard  against loss. Loan servicing policies for rural home loans shall  recognize the inherent differences between agricultural and rural home  lending.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operating loans. The objective shall be to service such loans to  assure disbursement in accordance with the basis of approval, repayment  from the sources obligated or pledged, and to minimize risk exposure to  the lender. Procedures shall require:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The procurement of periodic operating data essential for  maintaining control, for the proper analysis of such data, and prompt  action as needed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inspections, reappraisals, and borrower visits appropriate to  the nature and quality of the loan; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Controls on insurance, margin requirements, warehousing, and  the prompt exercise of legal options to preserve the lender's collateral  position and guard against loss.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Legal entity loans. In addition to the foregoing servicing  objectives for term and operating loans, procedures for servicing these  loans shall require procurement of data on changes in ownership,  control, and management; review of business objectives, financing  programs, organizational structure, and operating methods, and  appropriate analysis of such changes with provision for action as  needed.
