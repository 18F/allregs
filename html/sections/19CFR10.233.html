                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The preferential tariff treatment referred to in Sec. 10.231 applies to any of the following articles, provided that the article in question is a CBTPA originating good, is imported directly into the customs territory of the United States from a CBTPA beneficiary country, and is not accorded duty-free treatment under U.S. Note 2(b), Subchapter II, Chapter 98, HTSUS (see Sec. 10.26):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Footwear not designated on August 5, 1983, as eligible articles for the purpose of the Generalized System of Preferences under Title V, Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2461 through 2467);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tuna, prepared or preserved in any manner, in airtight containers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Petroleum, or any product derived from petroleum, provided for in headings 2709 and 2710 of the HTSUS;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Watches and watch parts (including cases, bracelets, and straps), of whatever type including, but not limited to, mechanical, quartz digital or quartz analog, if those watches or watch parts contain any material which is the product of any country with respect to which HTSUS column 2 rates of duty apply; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Articles to which reduced rates of duty apply under Sec. 10.198a, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application of NAFTA rules of origin. In determining whether an article is a CBTPA originating good for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, application of the provisions of General Note 12 of the HTSUS and the appendix to part 181 of this chapter will be subject to the following rules:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No country other than the United States and a CBTPA beneficiary country may be treated as being a party to the NAFTA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any reference to trade between the United States and Mexico will be deemed to refer to trade between the United States and a CBTPA beneficiary country;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any reference to a party will be deemed to refer to a CBTPA beneficiary country or the United States; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any reference to parties will be deemed to refer to any combination of CBTPA beneficiary countries or to the United States and one or more CBTPA beneficiary countries (or any combination involving the United States and CBTPA beneficiary countries).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duty reductions for leather-related articles. If, after it is determined that an article described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section qualifies as a CBTPA originating good and is eligible for preferential tariff treatment under this section, it is determined that the article in question also would otherwise qualify for a reduced rate of duty under Sec. 10.198a and that reduced rate of duty is lower than the rate of duty that would apply under this section, that lower rate of duty will apply to the article for purposes of preferential tariff treatment under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Imported directly defined. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the words ``imported directly'' mean:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct shipment from any CBTPA beneficiary country to the United States without passing through the territory of any country that is not a CBTPA beneficiary country;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the shipment is from any CBTPA beneficiary country to the United States through the territory of any country that is not a CBTPA beneficiary country, the articles in the shipment do not enter into the commerce of any country that is not a CBTPA beneficiary country while en route to the United States and the invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents show the United States as the final destination; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the shipment is from any CBTPA beneficiary country to the United States through the territory of any country that is not a CBTPA beneficiary country, and the invoices and other documents do not show the United States as the final destination, the articles in the shipment upon arrival in the United States are imported directly only if they:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Remained under the control of the customs authority of the intermediate country;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the port director is satisfied that the importation results from the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the producer's sales agent; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Were not subjected to operations other than loading or unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the articles in good condition.</p>
