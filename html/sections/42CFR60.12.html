It is the  responsibility of the borrower to provide the lender or holder with all  required information or other information regarding the requested  deferment. If written evidence that verifies eligibility of the activity  and the borrower for the deferment, including a certification from an  authorized official (e.g., the director of the fellowship activity, the  dean of the school, etc.), is received by the lender or holder within  the required time limit, the lender or holder must approve the  deferment. The lender or holder may rely in good faith upon statements  of the borrower and the authorized official, except where those  statements or other information conflict with information available to  the lender or holder. When those verification statements or other  information conflict with information available to the lender or holder,  to indicate that the applicant fails to meet the requirements for  deferment, the lender or holder may not approve the deferment until  those conflicts are resolved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of  this section, the borrower may request that the Secretary review a  decision by the lender or holder denying the deferment by sending to the  Secretary copies of the application for deferment and the lender's or  holder's denial of the request. However, if information submitted to the  lender or holder conflicts with other information available to the  lender or holder, to indicate that the borrower fails to meet the  requirements for deferment, the borrower may not request a review until  such conflicts have been resolved. During the review process, the lender  or holder must comply with any requests for information made by the  Secretary. If the Secretary determines that the fellowship or  educational activity is eligible for deferment and so notifies the   lender or holder, the lender or holder must approve the deferment.
