                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The primary purpose of conducting adequate and well- controlled studies of a new animal drug is to distinguish the effect of  the new animal drug from other influences, such as spontaneous change in  the course of the disease, normal animal production performance, or  biased observation. One or more adequate and well-controlled studies are  required to establish, by substantial evidence, that a new animal drug  is effective. The characteristics described in paragraph (b) of this  section have been developed over a period of years and are generally  recognized as the essentials of an adequate and well-controlled study.  Well controlled, as used in the phrase adequate and well controlled,  emphasizes an important aspect of adequacy. The Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) considers these characteristics in determining  whether a study is adequate and well controlled for purposes of section  512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C.  360b). Adequate and well-controlled studies, in addition to providing a  basis for determining whether a new animal drug is effective, may also  be relied upon to support target animal safety. The report of an  adequate and well-controlled study should provide sufficient details of  study design, conduct, and analysis   to allow critical evaluation and a determination of whether the  characteristics of an adequate and well-controlled study are present.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Characteristics. An adequate and well-controlled study has the  following characteristics:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The protocol for the study (protocol) and the report of the  study results (study report) must include a clear statement of the study  objective(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The study is conducted in accordance with an appropriate  standard of conduct that addresses, among other issues, study conduct,  study personnel, study facilities, and study documentation. The protocol  contains a statement acknowledging the applicability of, and intention  to follow, a standard of conduct acceptable to FDA. The study report  contains a statement describing adherence to the standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The study is conducted with a new animal drug that is produced  in accordance with appropriate manufacturing practices, which include,  but are not necessarily limited to, the manufacture, processing,  packaging, holding, and labeling of the new animal drug such that the  critical characteristics of identity, strength, quality, purity, and  physical form of the new animal drug are known, recorded, and  reproducible, to permit meaningful evaluations of and comparisons with  other studies conducted with the new animal drug. The physical form of a  new animal drug includes the formulation and physical characterization  (including delivery systems thereof, if any) of the new animal drug as  presented to the animal. The protocol and study report must include an  identification number which can be correlated with the specific  formulation and production process used to manufacture the new animal  drug used in the study.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The study uses a design that permits a valid comparison with one  or more controls to provide a quantitative evaluation of drug effects.  The protocol and the study report must describe the precise nature of  the study design, e.g., duration of treatment periods, whether  treatments are parallel, sequential, or crossover, and the determination  of sample size. Within the broad range of studies conducted to support a  determination of the effectiveness of a new animal drug, certain of the  controls listed below would be appropriate and preferred depending on  the study conducted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Placebo concurrent control. The new animal drug is compared with  an inactive preparation designed to resemble the new animal drug as far  as possible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Untreated concurrent control. The new animal drug is compared  with the absence of any treatment. The use of this control may be  appropriate when objective measurements of effectiveness, not subject to  observer bias, are available.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Active treatment concurrent control. The new animal drug is  compared with known effective therapy. The use of this control is  appropriate when the use of a placebo control or of an untreated  concurrent control would unreasonably compromise the welfare of the  animals. Similarity of the new animal drug and the active control drug  can mean either that both drugs were effective or that neither was  effective. The study report should assess the ability of the study to  have detected a difference between treatments. The evaluation of the  study should explain why the new animal drugs should be considered  effective in the study, for example, by reference to results in previous  placebo-controlled studies of the active control.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Historical control. The results of treatment with the new  animal drug are quantitatively compared with experience historically  derived from the adequately documented natural history of the disease or  condition, or with a regimen (therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic)  whose effectiveness is established, in comparable animals. Because  historical control populations usually cannot be as well assessed with  respect to pertinent variables as can concurrent control populations,  historical control designs are usually reserved for special  circumstances. Examples include studies in which the effect of the new  animal drug is self-evident or studies of diseases with high and  predictable mortality, or signs and symptoms of predictable duration or  severity, or, in the case of prophylaxis, predictable morbidity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The study uses a method of selecting animals that provides  adequate assurances that the animals are suitable for the purposes of  the study. For example, the animals can reasonably be expected to have  animal production characteristics typical of the class(es) of animals  for which the new animal drug is intended, there is adequate assurance  that the animals have the disease or condition being studied, or, in the  case of prophylactic agents, evidence of susceptibility and exposure to  the condition against which prophylaxis is desired has been provided.  The protocol and the study report describe the method of selecting  animals for the study.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The study uses a method to assign a treatment or a control to  each experimental unit of animals that is random and minimizes bias.  Experimental units of animals are groups of animals that are comparable  with respect to pertinent variables such as age, sex, class of animal,  severity of disease, duration of disease, dietary regimen, level of  animal production, and use of drugs or therapy other than the new animal  drug. The protocol and the study report describe the method of  assignment of animals to an experimental unit to account for pertinent  variables and method of assignment of a treatment or a control to the  experimental units. When the effect of such variables is accounted for  by an appropriate design, and when, within the same animal, effects due  to the test drug can be obtained free of the effects of such variables,  the same animal may be used for both the test drug and the control using  the controls set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The study uses methods to minimize bias on the part of observers  and analysts of the data that are adequate to prevent undue influences  on the results and interpretation of the study data. The protocol and  study report explain the methods of observation and recording of the  animal response variables and document the methods, such as ``blinding''  or ``masking,'' used in the study for excluding or minimizing bias in  the observations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The study uses methods to assess animal response that are well  defined and reliable. The protocol and study report describe the methods  for conducting the study, including any appropriate analytical and  statistical methods, used to collect and analyze the data resulting from  the conduct of the study, describe the criteria used to assess response,  and, when appropriate, justify the selection of the methods to assess  animal response.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> There is an analysis and evaluation of the results of the study  in accord with the protocol adequate to assess the effects of the new  animal drug. The study report evaluates the methods used to conduct, and  presents and evaluates the results of, the study as to their adequacy to  assess the effects of the new animal drug. This evaluation of the  results of the study assesses, among other items, the comparability of  treatment and control groups with respect to pertinent variables and the  effects of any interim analyses performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Field studies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Field conditions as used in this section  refers to conditions which closely approximate the conditions under  which the new animal drug, if approved, is intended to be applied or  administered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Studies of a new animal drug conducted under field conditions  shall, consistent with generally recognized scientific principles and  procedures, use an appropriate control that permits comparison, employ  procedures to minimize bias, and have the characteristics generally  described in paragraph (b) of this section. However, because field  studies are conducted under field conditions, it is recognized that the  level of control over some study conditions need not or should not be  the same as the level of control in laboratory studies. While not all  conditions relating to a field study need to be or should be controlled,  observations of the conditions under which the new animal drug is tested  shall be recorded in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of the  study. Adequate and well-controlled field studies shall balance the need  to control study conditions with the need to observe the true effect of  the new animal drug under closely approximated actual use conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waiver. The Director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine (the  Director) may, on the Director's own initiative   or on the petition of an interested person, waive in whole or in part  any of the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a  specific study. A petition for a waiver is required to set forth clearly  and concisely the specific criteria from which waiver is sought, why the  criteria are not reasonably applicable to the particular study, what  alternative procedures, if any, are to be, or have been employed, and  what results have been obtained. The petition is also required to state  why the studies so conducted will yield, or have yielded, substantial  evidence of effectiveness, notwithstanding nonconformance with the  criteria for which waiver is requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Uncontrolled studies. Uncontrolled studies or partially  controlled studies are not acceptable as the sole basis for the approval  of claims of effectiveness or target animal safety. Such studies,  carefully conducted and documented, may provide corroborative support of  adequate and well-controlled studies regarding effectiveness and may  yield valuable data regarding safety of the new animal drug. Such  studies will be considered on their merits in light of the  characteristics listed here. Isolated case reports, random experience,  and reports lacking the details which permit scientific evaluation will  not be considered.  [63 FR 10770, Mar. 5, 1998]</p>
