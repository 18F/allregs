Whenever (1) the  scientific data before the Commissioner (either the reports from the  scientific literature or the results of biological testing) suggest the  possibility that the color additive including its components or  impurities has induced cancer when ingested by man or animal; or (2)  tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of  additives in food suggest that the color additive, including its  components or impurities, induces cancer in man or animal, the  Commissioner shall determine whether, based on the judgment of  appropriately qualified scientists, cancer has been induced and whether  the color additive, including its components or impurities, was the  causative substance. If it is his judgment that the data do not  establish these facts, the cancer clause is not applicable; and if the  data considered as a whole establish that the color additive will be  safe under the conditions that can be specified in the applicable  regulation, it may be listed for such use. But if in the judgment of the  Commissioner, based on information from qualified scientists, cancer has  been induced, no regulation may issue which permits its use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Color additives that will not be ingested. Whenever the  scientific data before the Commissioner suggest the possibility that the  color additive, including its components or impurities, has induced  cancer in man or animals by routes other than ingestion, the  Commissioner shall determine whether, based on the judgment of  appropriately qualified scientists, the test suggesting the possibility  of carcinogenesis is appropriate for the evaluation of the color  additive for a use which does not involve ingestion, cancer has been  induced, and the color additive, including its components or impurities,  was the causative substance. If it is his judgment that the data do not  establish these facts, the cancer clause is not applicable to preclude  external drug and cosmetic uses, and if the data as a whole establish  that the color additive will be safe under conditions that can be  specified in the regulations, it may be listed for such use. But if, in  the judgment of the Commissioner, based on information from qualified  scientists, the test is an appropriate one for the consideration of  safety for the proposed external use, and cancer has been induced by the  color additive, including its components or impurities, no regulation  may issue which permits its use in external drugs and cosmetics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Color additives for use as an ingredient of feed for animals  that are raised for food production.
