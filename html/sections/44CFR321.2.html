Paragraph (a)(2) of this section is inclusive of the Department of Defense Preferential Planning List of End Items.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In selecting facilities for the Department of Defense mobilization base, consideration shall be given to their vulnerability to nuclear attack, with particular attention to the possibility of (1) minimizing vulnerability of facilities producing ``urgent'' items under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, including the need for dispersal, protective construction, and special security measures to safeguard against sabotage of clandestine attack, and (2) reducing concentration of uncommon critical production facilities so that a productive segment of each critical industry would be likely to survive a nuclear attack.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department of Energy and the Maritime Administration, in cooperation with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, shall determine the items and facilities which meet the above criteria for their respective programs for maintaining the mobilization base.</p>
