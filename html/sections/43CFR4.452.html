                                Sec. 4.452  Proceedings before the administrative law judge.

Sec. 4.452-1  Prehearing conferences.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The administrative law judge may in his discretion, on his own motion or on motion of one of the parties, or of the Bureau, direct the parties or their representatives to appear at a specified time and place for a prehearing conference to consider:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The simplification of the issues,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The necessity of amendments to the pleadings,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admissions of facts and agreements to the introduction of documents,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The limitation of the number of expert witnesses, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the proceedings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The administrative law judge shall make an order which recites the action taken at the conference, the amendments allowed to the pleadings, and the agreements made as to any of the matters considered, and which limits the issues for hearing to those not disposed of by admission or agreements. Such order shall control the subsequent course of the proceedings before the administrative law judge unless modified for good cause, by subsequent order.


Sec. 4.452-2  Notice of hearing.</p><p class="depth0">The administrative law judge shall fix a place and date for the hearing and notify all parties and the Bureau at least 30 days in advance of the date set, unless the parties and the Bureau request or consent to an earlier date. The notice shall include (a) the time, place,

and nature of the hearing, (b) the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held, and (c) the matters of fact and law asserted. All hearings held in connection with land selection appeals arising under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended, shall be conducted within the state of Alaska, unless the parties agree otherwise.
[47 FR 26392, June 18, 1982]


Sec. 4.452-3  Postponements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Postponements of hearings will not be allowed upon the request of any party or the Bureau except upon a showing of good cause and proper diligence. A request for a postponement must be served upon all parties to the proceeding and filed in the office of the administrative law judge at least 10 days prior to the date of the hearing. In no case will a request for postponement served or filed less than 10 days in advance of the hearing or made at the hearing be granted unless the party requesting it demonstrates that an extreme emergency occurred which could not have been anticipated and which justifies beyond question the granting of a postponement. In any such emergency, if time does not permit the filing of such request prior to the hearing, it may be made orally at the hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The request for a postponement must state in detail the reasons why a postponement is necessary. If a request is based upon the absence of witnesses, it must state what the substance of the testimony of the absent witnesses would be. No postponement will be granted if the adverse party or parties file with the administrative law judge within 5 days after the service of the request a statement admitting that the witnesses on account of whose absence the postponement is desired would, if present, testify as stated in the request. If time does not permit the filing of such statement prior to the hearing, it may be made orally at the hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Only one postponement will be allowed to a party on account of the absence of witnesses unless the party requesting a further postponement shall at the time apply for an order to take the testimony of the alleged absent witness by deposition.


Sec. 4.452-4  Authority of administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth0">The administrative law judge is vested with general authority to conduct the hearing in an orderly and judicial manner, including authority to subpoena witnesses and to take and cause depositions to be taken for the purpose of tasking testimony but not for discovery in accordance with the act of January 31, 1903 (43 U.S.C. 102-106), to administer oaths, to call and question witnesses, and to make a decision. The issuance of subpoenas, the attendance of witnesses and the taking of depositions shall be governed by Sec. Sec. 4.423 and 4.26 of the general rules in subpart B of this part.


Sec. 4.452-5  Conduct of hearing.</p><p class="depth0">So far as not inconsistent with a prehearing order, the administrative law judge may seek to obtain stipulations as to material facts and the issues involved and may state any other issues on which he may wish to have evidence presented. He may exclude irrelevant issues. The contestant will then present his case following which the other parties (and in private contests the Bureau, if it intervenes) will present their cases.


Sec. 4.452-6  Evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> All oral testimony shall be under oath and witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination. The administrative law judge may question any witness. Documentary evidence may be received if pertinent to any issue. The administrative law judge will summarily stop examination and exclude testimony which is obviously irrelevant and immaterial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Objections to evidence will be ruled upon by the administrative law judge. Such rulings will be considered, but need not be separately ruled upon, by the Board in connection with its decision. Where a ruling of an administrative law judge sustains an objection to the admission of evidence, the party affected may insert in the record, as a tender of proof, a summary written statement of the substance of the excluded evidence, and the objecting

party may then make an offer of proof in rebuttal.


Sec. 4.452-7  Reporter's fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Government agency initiating the proceedings will pay all reporting fees in hearings in Government contest proceedings, in hearings under the Surface Resources Act of 1955, as amended, in hearings under the Multiple Mineral Development Act of 1954, as amended, where the United States is a party, and in hearings under the Mining Claims Rights Restoration Act of 1955, regardless of which party is ultimately successful.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a private contest, each party will be required to pay the reporter's fees covering the party's direct evidence and cross-examination of witnesses, except that if the ultimate decision is adverse to the contestant, he must in addition pay all the reporter's fees otherwise payable by the contestee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Each party to a private contest shall be required by the administrative law judge to make reasonable deposits for reporter's fees from time to time in advance of taking testimony. Such deposits shall be sufficient to cover all reporter's fees for which the party may ultimately be liable under paragraph (b) of this section. Any part of a deposit not used will be returned to the depositor upon the final determination of the case except that deposits which are required to be made when a complaint is filed will not be returned if the party making the deposit does not appear at the hearing, but will be used to pay the reporter's fee. Reporter's fees will be at the rates established for the local courts, or, if the reporting is done pursuant to a contract, at rates established by the contract.


Sec. 4.452-8  Findings and conclusions; decision by administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> At the conclusion of the testimony the parties at the hearing shall be given a reasonable time by the administrative law judge, considering the number and complexity of the issues and the amount of testimony, to submit to the administrative law judge proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and reasons in support thereof or to stipulate to a waiver of such findings and conclusions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> As promptly as possible after the time allowed for presenting proposed findings and conclusions, the administrative law judge shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law (unless waiver has been stipulated), giving the reasons therefor, upon all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record. The administrative law judge may adopt the findings of fact and conclusions of law proposed by one or more of the parties if they are correct. He must rule upon each proposed finding and conclusion submitted by the parties and such ruling shall be shown in the record. The administrative law judge will render a written decision in the case which shall become a part of the record and shall include a statement of his findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor, and his rulings upon the findings and conclusions proposed by the parties if such rulings do not appear elsewhere in the record. A copy of the decision will be served upon all parties to the case.
[36 FR 7186, Apr. 15, 1971, as amended at 75 FR 64669, Oct. 20, 2010]


Sec. 4.452-9  Appeal to Board.</p><p class="depth0">Any party, including the Government, adversely affected by the decision of the administrative law judge may appeal to the Board as provided in Sec. 4.410, and the general rules in Subpart B of this part. No further hearing will be allowed in connection with the appeal to the Board but the Board, after considering the evidence, may remand any case for further hearing if it considers such action necessary to develop the facts.</p><p class="depth0">Grazing Procedures (Inside and Outside Grazing Districts)</p><p class="depth0">Source: 44 FR 41790, July 18, 1979, unless otherwise noted.</p>
