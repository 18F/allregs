                                Sec. 707.21  Requests for access to or copies of records.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How to submit. An individual may request access to or copies of  records maintained by OPIC that are retrieved by an individual's  personal identifier. To make a request for records a requester must  submit a written request to the Director of Human Resources Management  either by mail or delivery to Overseas Private Investment Corporation,  1100 New York Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20527 or electronic mail to  Privacy@opic.gov. The envelope or subject line should read ``Privacy Act  Request'' to ensure proper routing. Access to records maintained by OPIC  will be provided only by appointment. No officer or employee of OPIC  shall provide an individual with any records under this part until a  written request as described in paragraph (b) of this section is  provided and the identity of the individual is verified as described in  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information to include. All requests under this section must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be in writing and be signed by the requester. Unless the  requester is a current officer or employee of OPIC, the letter must also  be duly acknowledged before a notary public or other authorized public  official or signed under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements  to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide information sufficient to verify the identity of the  requester, including the requester's full name, current address, date of  birth, place of birth, or the system of record identification name or  number. Also include a clearly legible copy of a valid form of  identification. If the request is being made by a parent or guardian on  behalf of another, also include the same information for the individual  who is the subject of the request along with a court order, birth  certificate, or similar document proving the guardianship. OPIC will  review the sufficiency of identity evidence under paragraph (c) of this  section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide information sufficient to accurately identify the  records or information so that OPIC staff can locate the records with a  reasonable amount of effort. At minimum this should include the full  name, the system of record identification name, or the system  identification number for the individual who is the subject of the  records. Provision of a social security number is optional. If possible,  also include a description of the records as well as providing a record  creation time range and the name of the systems that should be searched.  A description of OPIC's system of records can be located in the  ``Privacy Act Compilation'' published by the National Archives and  Records Administration's Office of the Federal Register. Each system of  records is also published in the Federal Register;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Specify whether the individual wishes access to or copies of the  information pertaining to him. If access is requested, provide at least  one preferred date and hour for which an appointment is requested during  regular   business hours as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. OPIC  encourages appointments to be made at least one week in advance and for  a requester to provide at least three preferred appointment times; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Include an agreement to pay fees or an agreement to pay fees up  to a specified amount under Sec. 707.27. A request that does not  include an agreement to pay fees will be considered an agreement to pay  fees up to $25.00.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Verification of identity. Prior to providing any requested  information about an individual, the Director of Human Resources  Management shall verify the identity of the individual. If the requester  is acting as the guardian of the individual who is the subject of the  records, the Director will also verify the identity of the individual  who is the subject of the records, the relationship between the  requester and the subject individual, and that the requester is acting  on behalf of the subject individual. In order to verify identity, the  Director shall require the individual to provide reasonable proof of  identity such as a valid driver's license, identification card,  passport, employee identification card, or any other identifying  information. The Director shall deny any request where she determines,  at her sole discretion, that the evidence offered to verify the identity  of an individual is insufficient to conclusively establish the identity  of the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Release of records. Originals and record copies will not be  released from the files of OPIC. Individuals will not be permitted to  disturb any record files or to remove records from designated place of  examination. If copies were requested in the request letter, copies will  be furnished upon payment of the fees prescribed in Sec. 707.27.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Denial of request. If the Director of Human Resources Management  declines any request submitted under this section, the denial will be  made in writing and contain a brief description of the denial. Denials  include a determination that an individual has not provided adequate  evidence to verify identity under paragraph (c) of this section, a  determination that the record cannot be located, and a withholding of a  record in whole or in part. In the event of a denial, the requester may  file a written appeal within thirty days of the date of notification,  following the procedures in Sec. 707.25.</p>
