                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This subpart describes the basic policies and  procedures for the retroactive payment of Housing Assistance Payments to  eligible project owners for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31,  1991 and for one-time Contract Rent determinations for such eligible  project owners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. This subpart applies to all project-based Section  8 Housing Assistance Payments Contracts under New Construction (Part  880); Substantial Rehabilitation (Part 881); State Finance Agencies  (Part 883); and Section 515 Farmers Home Administration (Part 884). It  also applies to those projects under Section 202 Elderly or Handicapped  (Part 885) and Special Allocations (Part 886, Subparts A and C) whose  Contract Rents are adjusted by use of the Annual Adjustment Factors  (AAFs), as described in subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligible project owners. Project owners may be eligible for  retroactive payments if, during the period from October 1, 1979 to May  31, 1991:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The use of a comparability study by HUD (or the Contract  Administrator), which was conducted as an independent limitation on the  amount of rent adjustment that would have resulted from use of the  applicable AAF, resulted in the reduction of the maximum monthly  Contract Rents for units covered by a Housing Assistance Payments (HAP)  contract or resulted in less than the maximum increase for those units  than would otherwise be permitted by the AAF; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The HAP contract required a project owner to request annual rent  adjustments, and the project owner certifies that a request was not made  because of an anticipated reduction of the maximum monthly Contract  Rents resulting from a comparability study.</p>
