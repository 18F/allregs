                                Sec. 1985.106  Objections to the findings and the preliminary order
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any party who desires review, including judicial review, of the  findings and/or preliminary order, or a respondent alleging that the  complaint was frivolous or brought in bad faith who seeks an award of  attorney fees under CFPA, must file any objections and/or a request for  a hearing on the record within 30 days of receipt of the findings and  preliminary order pursuant to Sec. 1985.105. The objections, request for  a hearing, and/or request for attorney fees must be in writing and state  whether the objections are to the findings, the preliminary order, and/ or whether there should be an award of attorney fees. The date of the  postmark, facsimile transmittal, or electronic communication transmittal  is considered the date of filing; if the objection is filed in person,  by hand delivery or other means, the objection is filed upon receipt.  Objections must be filed with the Chief Administrative Law Judge, U.S.  Department of Labor, and copies of the objections must be mailed at the  same time to the other parties of record, the OSHA official who issued  the findings and order, the Assistant Secretary, and the Associate  Solicitor, Division of Fair Labor Standards, U.S. Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a timely objection is filed, all provisions of the  preliminary order will be stayed, except for the portion requiring  preliminary reinstatement, which will not be automatically stayed. The  portion of the preliminary order requiring reinstatement will be  effective immediately upon the respondent's receipt of the findings and  preliminary order, regardless of any objections to the order. The  respondent may file a motion with the Office of Administrative Law  Judges for a stay of the Assistant Secretary's preliminary order of  reinstatement, which shall be granted only based on exceptional  circumstances. If no timely objection is filed with respect to either  the findings or the preliminary order, the findings and/or the  preliminary order will become the final decision of   the Secretary, not subject to judicial review.</p>
