Any Restricted Data or National Security Information shall be separated from unclassified information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The general information shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A general description of the proposed geologic repository identifying the location of the geologic repository operations area, the general character of the proposed activities, and the basis for the exercise of licensing authority by the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proposed schedules for construction, receipt of waste, and emplacement of wastes at the proposed geologic repository operations area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A detailed plan to provide physical protection of high-level radioactive waste in accordance with Sec. 73.51 of this chapter. This plan must include the design for physical protection, the licensee's safeguards contingency plan, and security organization personnel training and qualification plan. The plan must list tests, inspections, audits, and other means to be used to demonstrate compliance with such requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the program to meet the requirements of Sec. 60.78.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A description of site characterization work actually conducted by DOE at all sites considered in the application and, as appropriate, explanations of why such work differed from the description of the site characterization program described in the Site Characterization Report for each site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Safety Analysis Report shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description and assessment of the site at which the proposed geologic repository operations area is to be located with appropriate attention to those features of the site that might affect geologic repository operations area design and performance.

For the purposes of this analysis, it shall be assumed that operations at the geologic repository operations area will be carried out at the maximum capacity and rate of receipt of radioactive waste stated in the application.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> An explanation of measures used to support the models used to perform the assessments required in paragraphs (A) through (D).
