                            <p class="depth0">Commercial Activity Review. The process of evaluating CAs for the purpose of determining whether or not a cost comparison will be conducted.</p><p class="depth0">Commercial Source. A business or other non-Federal activity located in the United States, its territories and possessions, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that provides a commercial product or service.</p><p class="depth0">Conversion to Contract. The changeover of a CA from performance by DoD personnel to performance under contract by a commercial source.</p><p class="depth0">Conversion to In-House. The changeover of a CA from performance under contract to performance by DoD personnel.</p><p class="depth0">Core Logistics. Those functions identified as core logistics activities pursuant to section 307 of Pub. L 98-525 and section 1231 of Pub. L. 99-145, codified at section 2464, title 10 that are necessary to maintain a logistics capability (including personnel, equipment, and facilities) to ensure a ready and controlled source of technical competence and resources necessary to ensure effective and timely response to a mobilization, national defense contingency situation, and other emergency requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Cost Comparison. The process of developing an estimate of the cost of performance of a CA by DoD employees and comparing it, in accordance with the requirements in DoD Instruction 4100.33 to the cost of performance by contract.</p><p class="depth0">Direct-Conversion. Conversion to contract performance of an in-house commercial activity based on a simplified cost comparsion or the conversion of an in-house commerical activity performed exclusively by military personnel.</p><p class="depth0">Displaced DoD Employee. Any DoD employee affected by conversion to contract operation (including such actions as job elimination, or grade reduction). It includes both employees in the function converted to contract and employees outside the function who are affected adversely by conversion through reassignment or the exercise of bumping or retreat rights.</p><p class="depth0">DoD Commercial Activity (CA). An activity that provides a product or service obtainable (or obtained) from a commerical source. A DoD CA may be the mission of an organization or a function within the organization. It must be type of work that is separable from other functions or activities so that it is suitable for performance by contract. A representative list of the

functions performed by such activities is provided in enclosure 3 of DoD Instruction 4100.33. A DoD CA falls into one of two categories:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contract CA. A DoD CA managed by a DoD Component, but operated with contractor personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In-House CA. A DoD CA operated by a DoD Component with DoD personnel.</p><p class="depth0">DoD Employee. Civilian personnel of the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth0">DoD Governmental Function. A function that is related so intimately to the public interest as to mandate performance by DoD personnel. These functions include those that require either the exercise of discretion in applying Government authority or the use of value judgment in making the decision for the Department of Defense. Services or products in support of Governmental functions, such as those listed in enclosure 3 of DoD Instruction 4100.33, are CAs and are subject to this part and its implementing Instructions. Governmental functions normally fall into two categories:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Act of Governing. The discretionary exercise of Governmental authority. Examples include criminal investigations, prosecutions, and other judicial functions; management of Government programs requiring value judgments, as in direction of the national defense; management and direction of the Armed Services; activities performed exclusively by military personnel who are subject to deployment in a combat, combat support, or combat service support role; conduct of foreign relations; selection of program priorities; direction of Federal employees; regulation of the use of space, oceans, navigable rivers, and other natural resources; management of natural resources on Federal Property; direction of intelligence and counterintelligence operations; and regulation of industry and commerce, including food and drugs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monetary Transactions and Entitlements. Refers to such actions as tax collection and revenue disbursements; control of treasury accounts and the money supply, and the administration of public trusts.</p><p class="depth2">DoD Personnel. Military and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth2">Expansion. The modernization, replacement, upgrading, or enlargement of a DoD CA involving a cost increase exceeding either 30 percent of the total capital investment or 30 percent of the annual personnel and material costs. A consolidation of two or more CAs is not an expansion, unless the proposed total capital investment or annual personnel and material costs of the consolidation exceeds the total of the individual CAs by 30 percent or more.</p><p class="depth2">Installation. An installation is the grouping of facilities, collocated in the same vicinity, that supports particular functions. Activities collocated and supported by an installation are considered to be tenants.</p><p class="depth2">Installation Commander. The commanding officer or head of an installation or a tenant activity, who has budget and supervisory control over resources and personnel.</p><p class="depth2">New Requirement. A recently established need for a commercial product or service. A new requirement does not include interim in-house operation of essential services pending reacquisition of the services prompted by such action as the termination of an existing contract operation.</p><p class="depth2">Preferential Procurement Programs. Preferential procurement programs include mandatory source programs such as Federal Prison Industries (FPI) and the workshops administered by the Committee for Purchase from the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped under Pub. L. 92-98. Small, minority, and disadvantaged businesses; and labor surplus area set-asides and awards made under Pub. L. 85-536, section 8(a) and Pub. L. 95-507 are included under preferential procurement programs.</p><p class="depth2">Right of First Refusal of Employment. Contractors provide Government employees, displaced as a result of the conversion to contract performance, the right of first refusal for employment openings under the contract in positions for which they are qualified, if that employment is consistent with post-Government employment conflict of interest standards.</p>
