                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After receiving an application for inspection, the OCMI will  inspect a tank vessel in his or her jurisdiction once every 5 years. The  OCMI will ensure that every tank vessel is of a   structure suitable for the carriage of flammable and/or combustible  liquids in bulk and for the proper grade or grades of cargo the vessel  carries while in service. If the OCMI deems it necessary, he or she may  direct the vessel to be put in motion, and may adopt any other suitable  means to test the tank vessel and its equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The inspection for certification shall include an inspection of  the structure, boilers, and other pressure vessels, machinery and  equipment. The inspection shall be such as to insure that the vessel, as  regards the structure, boilers, and other pressure vessels and their  appurtenances, piping, main and auxiliary machinery, electrical  installations, life-saving appliances, fire-detecting and extinguishing  equipment, pilot boarding equipment, and other equipment is in  satisfactory condition and fit for the service for which it is intended,  and that it complies with the applicable regulations for such vessels,  and determine that the vessel is in possession of a valid certificate  issued by the Federal Communications Commission, if required. The  lights, means of making sound signals, and distress signals carried by  the vessel shall also be subject to the above-mentioned inspection for  the purpose of ensuring that they comply with the requirements of the  applicable statutes and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the vessel passes the inspection for certification, the OCMI  will issue a new Certificate of Inspection.
