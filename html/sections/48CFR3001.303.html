Subparagraph numbers/letters may not be shown as sequential, but may be  shown by the specific paragraph/subparagraph implemented from the FAR  (e.g., (HSAR) 48 CFR 3003.301 contains subparagraphs (a) and (b) because  only these subparagraphs, correlating to FAR, are being supplemented by  (HSAR) 48 CFR chapter 30).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Component-unique guidance. Supplementary material for which  there is no counterpart in the FAR or HSAR shall be identified using  chapter, part, subpart, section, or subsection numbers of ``90'' and up  (e.g., the U.S. Coast Guard's acronym is ``USCG''; an USCG-unique clause  pertaining to ``Inspection and/or Acceptance'' would be designated  ``USCG 3052.246-90'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> References and citations. Cross references to the FAR in the  HSAR will be cited by ``FAR'' followed by the FAR numbered cite, and  cross reference to the HSAM in the HSAR will be cited by ``HSAM''  followed by the HSAM numbered cite.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Department/agency and Component supplements must parallel the  FAR and HSAR numbering, except department/agency supplemental numbering  uses subsection numbering of 90 and up, instead of 70 and up.</p><p class="depth3">Table 1-1--HSAR Numbering ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">FAR                 Is implemented as    Is supplemented as ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 19...........................            3019               3019.70 19.5.........................            3019.5             3019.570 19.501.......................            3019.501           3019.501-70 19.501-1.....................            3019.501-1         3019.501-170 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   [68 FR 67871, Dec. 4, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 48800, Aug. 22, 2006; 77  FR 50632, Aug. 22, 2012]</p>
