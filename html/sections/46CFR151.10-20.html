                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Construction features. (1) Each barge hull shall be constructed with a suitable bow form (length, shape, and height of headlog) to protect against diving at the maximum speed at which the barge is designed to be towed. In

any integrated tow, only the lead barge need comply with this requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each barge hull shall be constructed with a suitable bow form (length, shape, and height of headlog) to protect against diving at the maximum speed at which the barge is designed to be towed. In

any integrated tow, only the lead barge need comply with this requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All ``open hopper'' type barges shall be provided with coamings around the hopper space and a 36-inch minimum height plowshare breakwater on the forward rake. The plowshare breakwater may be omitted, if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commandant that sufficient protection is achieved without it. Coamings shall have a minimum height of 36 inches forward and may be graduated to a minimum height of 24 inches at midlength and 18 inches thereafter. All hopper barges constructed with a weathertight rain shield over the hopper space are exempt from these requirements, except that they shall be provided with an 18-inch minimum coaming all around the hopper.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All ``open hopper'' type barges modified for the carriage of chlorine in bulk shall be provided with 36-inch minimum height coamings around the hopper.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All barges in ocean or coastwise service shall be provided with a structural deck and hatches in accordance with the applicable provisions of subchapter E of this chapter and the scantling requirements of the American Bureau of Shipping.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Hull structural requirements. (1) All Types I, II, and III barges shall comply with the basic structural requirements of the American Bureau of Shipping for barges of the ordinary types and the applicable supplementary requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All Types I, II, and III barges shall comply with the basic structural requirements of the American Bureau of Shipping for barges of the ordinary types and the applicable supplementary requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Types I and II barges in inland service: A grounding condition shall be assumed where the forward rake bulkhead rests upon a pinnacle at the water surface. The maximum hull and tank bending moment and tank saddle reactions (if applicable) shall be determined. The hull bending stress shall not exceed the applicable limits of paragraphs (b)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. The maximum tank bending moment and saddle reaction shall be used in the tank design calculations required by Sec.  151.15-2(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Independent tanks supported by only two saddles do not contribute to the strength and stiffness of the barge hull. In such case, the hull stress shall not exceed either 50 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the material or 70 percent of the yield strength when specified, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Independent tanks supported by three or more saddles contribute to the strength and stiffness of the hull. In such case, the hull stress shall not exceed the percentage stress values prescribed in Sec.  151.10-20(b)(2)(i), multiplied by the quantity
(1.5-SWT/UTS),
where SWT is the stress calculated without including the effect of the</p><p class="depth0">tanks, and UTS is the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the</p><p class="depth0">material. The value SWT, however, shall in no case be more</p><p class="depth0">than 75 percent of UTS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Integral tanks may be considered as contributing to the strength and stiffness of the barge hull. The hull stresses for integral tank barges shall not exceed the percentage stress values prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(i), of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Types I and II barges in ocean service:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Independent tank barges with tanks supported by three or more saddles shall be subjected to a 0.6L\0.6\ trochoidal wave hogsag analysis to determine the maximum hull and tank bending moments and tank saddle reactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All independent tank barges, regardless of the number of saddle supports shall be subject to a still water bending analysis to determine the hull bending moment. For those barges with independent tanks supported by three or more saddles, this analysis shall consider tank-hull interaction so as to determine tank bending moments and saddle reactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The still water tank bending moments and saddle reactions shall be superimposed upon those obtained by simultaneous application of the following dynamic loadings:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Rolling 30[deg] each side (120[deg] full cycle) in 10 seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Pitching 6[deg] half amplitude (24[deg] full cycle) in 7 seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Heaving L/80 half amplitude (L/20 full cycle) in 8 seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The hull structure and saddle support system shall be analyzed, using the maximum hull bending moments and saddle reactions obtained from the

foregoing. Bending stress shall not exceed 60 percent of the yield strength or 42 percent of the minimum tensile strength of the material, whichever is less. Critical buckling strength shall be at least 75 percent greater than calculated buckling stresses. The maximum tank bending moments and saddle reactions shall be used in the tank design calculations required by Sec.  151.15-3(b)(8).</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 151.12_Equipment and Operating Requirements for Control of</p><p class="depth0">Pollution From Category D NLS Cargoes</p><p class="depth0">Source: CGD 81-101, 52 FR 7777, Mar. 12, 1987, unless otherwise noted.</p>
