In computing the number of days allowed for filing a document, the first day counted is the day after the action or event from which the period begins to run. If the date that ordinarily would be the last day for filing falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, a Federal holiday, or a District holiday, the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal or a District holiday.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For benefit accrual.

In cases where more or less than 8 hours of sick leave would be charged for a day's absence, total service is increased by the number of days in the period between the date of separation and the date that the unused sick leave would have expired had the employee used it (except that holidays falling

within the period are treated as work days, and no additional leave credit is earned for that period).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an employee's tour of duty changes from part time to full time or full time to part time within 180 days before retirement, the credit for unused sick leave is computed as though no change had occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For counting leave without pay (LWOP) that is creditable service.
