                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Non-incidental materials and supplies. Except as  provided in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, amounts paid  to acquire or produce materials and supplies (as defined in paragraph  (c) of this section) are deductible in the taxable year in which the  materials and supplies are first used in the taxpayer's operations or  are consumed in the taxpayer's operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Incidental materials and supplies. Amounts paid to acquire or  produce incidental materials and supplies (as defined in paragraph (c)  of this section) that are carried on hand and for which no record of  consumption is kept or of which physical inventories at the beginning  and end of the taxable year are not taken, are deductible in the taxable  year in which these amounts are paid, provided taxable income is clearly  reflected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use or consumption of rotable and temporary spare parts. Except  as provided in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, for  purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rotable and temporary  spare parts (defined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) are first  used in the taxpayer's operations or are consumed in the taxpayer's  operations in the taxable year in which the taxpayer disposes of the  parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Coordination with other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  Nothing in this section changes the treatment of any amount that is  specifically provided for under any provision of the Internal Revenue  Code (Code) or regulations other than section 162(a) or section 212 and  the regulations under those sections. For example, see Sec. 1.263(a)-3,  which requires taxpayers to capitalize amounts paid to improve tangible  property and section 263A and the regulations under section 263A, which  require taxpayers to capitalize the direct and allocable indirect costs,  including the cost of materials and supplies, of property produced by  the taxpayer and property acquired for resale. See also Sec. 1.471-1,  which requires taxpayers to include in inventory certain materials and  supplies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Materials and supplies. For purposes of this  section, materials and supplies means tangible property that is used or  consumed in the taxpayer's operations that is not inventory and that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is a component acquired to maintain, repair, or improve a unit  of tangible property (as determined under Sec. 1.263(a)-3(e)) owned,  leased, or serviced by the taxpayer and that is not acquired as part of  any single unit of tangible property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consists of fuel, lubricants, water, and similar items,  reasonably expected to be consumed in 12 months or less, beginning when  used in the taxpayer's operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Is a unit of property as determined under Sec. 1.263(a)-3(e)  that has an economic useful life of 12 months or less, beginning when  the property is used or consumed in the taxpayer's operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Is a unit of property as determined under Sec. 1.263(a)-3(e)  that has an acquisition cost or production cost (as determined under  section 263A) of $200 or less (or other amount as identified in  published guidance in the Federal Register or in the Internal Revenue  Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Is identified in published guidance in the Federal Register or  in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this  chapter) as materials and supplies for which treatment is permitted  under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rotable and temporary spare parts. For purposes of this section,  rotable spare parts are materials and supplies under paragraph (c)(1)(i)  of this section that are acquired for installation on a unit of  property, removable from that unit of property, generally repaired or  improved, and either reinstalled on the same or other property or stored  for later installation. Temporary spare parts are materials and supplies  under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section that are used temporarily  until a new or repaired part can be installed and then are removed and  stored for later installation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Standby emergency spare parts. Standby emergency spare parts are  materials and supplies under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section that  are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Acquired when particular machinery or equipment is acquired (or  later acquired and set aside for use in particular machinery or  equipment);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Set aside for use as replacements to avoid substantial  operational time loss caused by emergencies due to particular machinery  or equipment failure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Located at or near the site of the installed related machinery  or equipment so as to be readily available when needed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Directly related to the particular machinery or piece of  equipment they serve;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Normally expensive;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Only available on special order and not readily available from  a vendor or manufacturer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Not subject to normal periodic replacement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Not interchangeable in other machines or equipment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Not acquired in quantity (generally only one is on hand for each  piece of machinery or equipment); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Not repaired and reused.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Economic useful life--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The economic useful life  of a unit of property is not necessarily the useful life inherent in the  property but is the period over which the property may reasonably be  expected to be useful to the taxpayer or, if the taxpayer is engaged in  a trade or business or an activity for the production of income, the  period over which the property may reasonably be expected to be useful  to the taxpayer in its trade or business or for the production of  income, as applicable. The factors that must be considered in  determining this period are provided under Sec. 1.167(a)-1(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Taxpayers with an applicable financial statement. For taxpayers  with an applicable financial statement (as defined in paragraph  (c)(4)(iii) of this section), the economic useful life of a unit of  property, solely for the purposes of applying the provisions of this  paragraph (c), is the useful life initially used by the taxpayer for  purposes of determining depreciation in its applicable financial  statement, regardless of any salvage value of the property. If a  taxpayer does not have an applicable financial statement for the taxable   year in which a unit of property was originally acquired or produced,  the economic useful life of the unit of property must be determined  under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. Further, if a taxpayer treats  amounts paid for a unit of property as an expense in its applicable  financial statement on a basis other than the useful life of the  property or if a taxpayer does not depreciate the unit of property on  its applicable financial statement, the economic useful life of the unit  of property must be determined under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this  section. For example, if a taxpayer has a policy of treating as an  expense on its applicable financial statement amounts paid for a unit of  property costing less than a certain dollar amount, notwithstanding that  the unit of property has a useful life of more than one year, the  economic useful life of the unit of property must be determined under  paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(B)</em> of this  section). The financial statements are, in descending priority--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A financial statement required to be filed with the Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC) (the 10-K or the Annual Statement to  Shareholders);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A certified audited financial statement that is accompanied by  the report of an independent certified public accountant (or in the case  of a foreign entity, by the report of a similarly qualified independent  professional), that is used for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Credit purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reporting to shareholders, partners, or similar persons; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any other substantial non-tax purpose; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A financial statement (other than a tax return) required to be  provided to the federal or a state government or any federal or state  agency (other than the SEC or the Internal Revenue Service).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Amount paid. For purposes of this section, in the case of a  taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting, the terms amount paid  and payment mean a liability incurred (within the meaning of Sec.  1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)). A liability may not be taken into account under this  section prior to the taxable year during which the liability is  incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> and are separately defined and addressed in Sec. 1.263(a)-3.  Amounts paid to produce materials and supplies are subject to section  263A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Election to capitalize and depreciate certain materials and  supplies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A taxpayer may elect to treat as a capital  expenditure and to treat as an asset subject to the allowance for  depreciation the cost of any rotable spare part, temporary spare part,  or standby emergency spare part as defined in paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3)  of this section. Except as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this  section, an election made under this paragraph (d) applies to amounts  paid during the taxable year to acquire or produce any rotable,  temporary, or standby emergency spare part to which paragraph (a) of  this section would apply (but for the election under this paragraph  (d)). Any property for which this election is made shall not be treated  as a material or a supply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> or (c)(3) of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The rotable, temporary, or standby emergency spare part is  intended to be used as a component of a unit of property under paragraph  (c)(1)(iii), (iv), or (v) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rotable, temporary, or standby emergency spare part is  intended to be used as a component of a property described in paragraph  (c)(1)(i) and the taxpayer cannot or has not elected to   capitalize and depreciate that property under this paragraph (d); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount is paid to acquire or produce a rotable or  temporary spare part and the taxpayer uses the optional method of  accounting for rotable and temporary spare parts under paragraph (e) to  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Manner of electing. A taxpayer makes the election under this  paragraph (d) by capitalizing the amounts paid to acquire or produce a  rotable, temporary, or standby emergency spare part in the taxable year  the amounts are paid and by beginning to depreciate the costs when the  asset is placed in service by the taxpayer for purposes of determining  depreciation under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue  Code and the Treasury Regulations. Section 1.263(a)-2 provides for the  treatment of amounts paid to acquire or produce real or personal  tangible property. A taxpayer must make the election under this  paragraph (d) in its timely filed original Federal tax return (including  extensions) for the taxable year the asset is placed in service by the  taxpayer for purposes of determining depreciation. Sections 301.9100-1  through 301.9100-3 of this chapter provide the rules governing  extensions of the time to make regulatory elections. In the case of an S  corporation or a partnership, the election is made by the S corporation  or partnership, and not by the shareholders or partners. A taxpayer may  make an election for each rotable, temporary, or standby emergency spare  part that qualifies for the election under this paragraph (d). This  election does not apply to an asset or a portion thereof placed in  service and disposed of in the same taxable year. A taxpayer may revoke  an election made under this paragraph (d) or made under Sec. 1.162- 3T(d), as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2013, only  by filing a request for a private letter ruling and obtaining the  Commissioner's consent to revoke the election. The Commissioner may  grant a request to revoke this election if the taxpayer acted reasonably  and in good faith and the revocation will not prejudice the interests of  the Government. See generally Sec. 301.9100-3 of this chapter. The  manner of electing and revoking the election to capitalize under this  paragraph (d) or under Sec. 1.162-3T(d), as contained in 26 CFR part 1,  revised as of April 1, 2013, may be modified through guidance of general  applicability (see Sec. Sec. 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this  chapter). An election may not be made or revoked through the filing of  an application for change in accounting method or, before obtaining the  Commissioner's consent to make the late election or to revoke the  election, by filing an amended Federal tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Optional method of accounting for rotable and temporary spare  parts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This paragraph (e) provides an optional method of  accounting for rotable and temporary spare parts (the optional method  for rotable parts). A taxpayer may use the optional method for rotable  parts, instead of the general rule under paragraph (a)(3) of this  section, to account for its rotable and temporary spare parts as defined  in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A taxpayer that uses the optional  method for rotable parts must use this method for all of its pools of  rotable and temporary spare parts used in the same trade or business and  for which it uses this method for its books and records. If a taxpayer  uses the optional method for rotable parts for pools of rotable and  temporary spare parts for which the taxpayer does not use the optional  method for its books and records, then the taxpayer must use the  optional method for all its pools in the same trade or business, whether  rotable or temporary. The optional method for rotable parts is a method  of accounting under section 446(a). Under the optional method for  rotable parts, the taxpayer must apply the rules in this paragraph (e)  to each rotable or temporary spare part (part) upon the taxpayer's  initial installation, removal, repair, maintenance or improvement,  reinstallation, and disposal of each part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Description of optional method for rotable parts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Initial  installation. The taxpayer must deduct the amount paid to acquire or  produce the part in the taxable year that the part is first installed on  a unit of property for use in the taxpayer's operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Removal from unit of property. In each taxable year in which  the part is   removed from a unit of property to which it was initially or  subsequently installed, the taxpayer must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Include in gross income the fair market value of the part; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Include in the basis of the part the fair market value of the  part included in income under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section  and the amount paid to remove the part from the unit of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Repair, maintenance, or improvement of part. The taxpayer may  not currently deduct and must include in the basis of the part any  amounts paid to maintain, repair, or improve the part in the taxable  year these amounts are paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>, in the taxable year that the part is  reinstalled on a unit of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Disposal of the part. The taxpayer must deduct the amounts  included in the basis of the part under paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(B) and  (e)(2)(iii) of this section, to the extent that those amounts have not  been previously deducted under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, in  the taxable year in which the part is disposed of by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(3)(iv)</em> for  the treatment of safe harbor amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Sale or disposition of materials and supplies. Upon sale or  other disposition, materials and supplies as defined in this section are  not treated as a capital asset under section 1221 or as property used in  the trade or business under section 1231. Any asset for which the  taxpayer makes the election to capitalize and depreciate under paragraph  (d) of this section shall not be treated as a material or supply, and  the recognition and character of the gain or loss for such depreciable  asset are determined under other applicable provisions of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Examples. The rules of this section are illustrated by the  following examples, in which it is assumed, unless otherwise stated,  that the property is not an incidental material or supply, that the  taxpayer computes its income on a calendar year basis, that the taxpayer  does not make the election to apply paragraph (d) of this section, or  use the method of accounting described in paragraph (e) of this section,  and that the taxpayer has not elected to apply the de minimis safe  harbor under Sec. 1.263(a)-1(f). The following examples illustrate only  the application of this section and, unless otherwise stated, do not  address the treatment under other provisions of the Code (for example,  section 263A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1 Non-rotable components. A owns a fleet of aircraft that it  operates in its business. In Year 1, A purchases a stock of spare parts,  which it uses to maintain and repair its aircraft. A keeps a record of  consumption of these spare parts. In Year 2, A uses the spare parts for  the repair and maintenance of one of its aircraft. Assume each aircraft  is a unit of property under Sec. 1.263(a)-3(e) and that spare parts are  not rotable or temporary spare parts under paragraph (c)(2) of this  section. Assume these repair and maintenance activities do not improve  the aircraft under Sec. 1.263(a)-3. These parts are materials and  supplies under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section because they are  components acquired and used to maintain and repair A's aircraft. Under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the amounts that A paid for the spare  parts in Year 1 are deductible in Year 2, the taxable year in which the  spare parts are first used to repair and maintain the aircraft.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2 Rotable spare parts; disposal method. B operates a fleet  of specialized vehicles that it uses in its service business. Assume  that each vehicle is a unit of property under Sec. 1.263(a)-3(e). At  the time that it acquires a new type of vehicle, B also acquires a  substantial number of rotable spare parts that it will keep on hand to  quickly replace similar parts in B's vehicles as those parts break down  or wear out. These rotable parts are removable from the vehicles and are  repaired so that they can be reinstalled on the same or similar  vehicles. In Year 1, B acquires several vehicles and a number of rotable  spare parts to be used as replacement parts in these vehicles. In Year  2, B repairs several vehicles by using these rotable spare parts to  replace worn or damaged parts. In Year 3, B removes these rotable spare  parts from its vehicles, repairs the parts, and reinstalls them on other  similar vehicles. In Year 5, B can no longer use the rotable parts it  acquired in Year 1 and disposes of them as scrap. Assume that B does not  improve any of the rotable spare parts under Sec. 1.263(a)-3. Under  paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the rotable spare parts acquired in  Year 1 are materials and supplies. Under paragraph (a)(3) of this  section, rotable spare parts are generally used or consumed in the  taxable year in which the taxpayer disposes of the parts. Therefore,  under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the amounts that B paid for the  rotable spare parts in Year 1 are deductible in Year 5, the taxable year  in which B disposes of the parts.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3 Rotable spare parts; application of optional method of  accounting. C operates a fleet of specialized vehicles that it uses in  its service business. Assume that each vehicle is a unit of property  under Sec. 1.263(a)-3(e). At the time that it acquires a new type of  vehicle, C also acquires a substantial number of rotable spare parts  that it will keep on hand to replace similar parts in C's vehicles as  those parts break down or wear out. These rotable parts are removable  from the vehicles and are repaired so that they can be reinstalled on  the same or similar vehicles. C uses the optional method of accounting  for all its rotable and temporary spare parts under paragraph (e) of  this section. In Year 1, C acquires several vehicles and a number of  rotable spare parts (the ``Year 1 rotable parts'') to be used as  replacement parts in these vehicles. In Year 2, C repairs several  vehicles and uses the Year 1 rotable parts to replace worn or damaged  parts. In Year 3, C pays amounts to remove these Year 1 rotable parts  from its vehicles. In Year 4, C pays amounts to maintain, repair, or  improve the Year 1 rotable parts. In Year 5, C pays amounts to reinstall  the Year 1 rotable parts on other similar vehicles. In Year 8, C removes  the Year 1 rotable parts from these vehicles and stores these parts for  possible later use. In Year 9, C disposes of the Year 1 rotable parts.  Under paragraph (e) of this section, C must deduct the amounts paid to  acquire and install the Year 1 rotable parts in Year 2, the taxable year  in which the rotable parts are first installed by C in C's vehicles. In  Year 3, when C removes the Year 1 rotable parts from its vehicles, C  must include in its gross income the fair market value of each part.  Also, in Year 3, C must include in the basis of each Year 1 rotable part  the fair market value of the rotable part and the amount paid to remove  the rotable part from the vehicle. In Year 4, C must include in the  basis of each Year 1 rotable part the amounts paid to maintain, repair,  or improve each rotable part. In Year 5, the year that C reinstalls the  Year 1 rotable parts (as repaired or improved) in other vehicles, C must  deduct the reinstallation costs and the amounts previously included in  the basis of each part. In Year 8, the year that C removes the Year 1  rotable parts from the vehicles, C must include in income the fair  market value of each rotable part removed. In addition, in Year 8, C  must include in the basis of each part the fair market value of that  part and the amount paid to remove each rotable part from the vehicle.  In Year 9, the year that C disposes of the Year 1 rotable parts, C may  deduct the amounts remaining in the basis of each rotable part.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4 Rotable part acquired as part of a single unit of  property; not material or supply. D operates a fleet of aircraft. In  Year 1, D acquires a new aircraft, which includes two new aircraft  engines. The aircraft costs $500,000 and has an economic useful life of  more than 12 months, beginning when it is placed in service. In Year 5,  after the aircraft is operated for several years in D's business, D  removes the engines from the aircraft, repairs or improves the engines,  and either reinstalls the engines on a similar aircraft or stores the  engines for later reinstallation. Assume the aircraft purchased in Year  1, including its two engines, is a unit of property under Sec.  1.263(a)-3(e). Because the engines were acquired as part of the  aircraft, a single unit of property, the engines are not materials or  supplies under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section nor rotable or  temporary spare parts under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.  Accordingly, D may not apply the rules of this section to the aircraft  engines upon the original acquisition of the aircraft nor after the  removal of the engines from the aircraft for use in the same or similar  aircraft. Rather, D must apply the rules under Sec. Sec. 1.263(a)-2 and  1.263(a)-3 to the aircraft, including its engines, to determine the  treatment of amounts paid to acquire, produce, or improve the unit of  property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5 Consumable property. E operates a fleet of aircraft that  carries freight for its customers. E has several storage tanks on its  premises, which hold jet fuel for its aircraft.   Assume that once the jet fuel is placed in E's aircraft, the jet fuel is  reasonably expected to be consumed within 12 months or less. On December  31, Year 1, E purchases a two-year supply of jet fuel. In Year 2, E uses  a portion of the jet fuel purchased on December 31, Year 1, to fuel the  aircraft used in its business. The jet fuel that E purchased in Year 1  is a material or supply under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section  because it is reasonably expected to be consumed within 12 months or  less from the time it is placed in E's aircraft. Under paragraph (a)(1)  of this section, E may deduct in Year 2 the amounts paid for the portion  of jet fuel used in the operation of E's aircraft in Year 2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6 Unit of property that costs $200 or less. F operates a  business that rents out a variety of small individual items to customers  (rental items). F maintains a supply of rental items on hand. In Year 1,  F purchases a large quantity of rental items to use in its rental  business. Assume that each rental item is a unit of property under Sec.  1.263(a)-3(e) and costs $200 or less. In Year 2, F begins using all the  rental items purchased in Year 1 by providing them to customers of its  rental business. F does not sell or exchange these items on established  retail markets at any time after the items are used in the rental  business. The rental items are materials and supplies under paragraph  (c)(1)(iv) of this section. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the  amounts that F paid for the rental items in Year 1 are deductible in  Year 2, the taxable year in which the rental items are first used in F's  business.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7 Unit of property that costs $200 or less. G provides  billing services to its customers. In Year 1, G pays amounts to purchase  50 scanners to be used by its employees. Assume each scanner is a unit  of property under Sec. 1.263(a)-3(e) and costs less than $200. In Year  1, G's employees begin using 35 of the scanners, and F stores the  remaining 15 scanners for use in a later taxable year. The scanners are  materials and supplies under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. Under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the amounts G paid for 35 of the  scanners are deductible in Year 1, the taxable year in which G first  uses each of those scanners. The amounts that G paid for each of the  remaining 15 scanners are deductible in the taxable year in which each  machine is first used in G's business.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8 Materials and supplies that cost less than $200; de  minimis safe harbor. Assume the same facts as in Example 7 except that  G's scanners qualify for the de minimis safe harbor under Sec.  1.263(a)-1(f), and G properly elects to apply the de minimis safe harbor  under Sec. 1.263(a)-1(f) to amounts paid in Year 1. G must apply the de  minimis safe harbor under Sec. 1.263(a)-1(f) to amounts paid for the  scanners, rather than treat these amounts as costs of materials and  supplies under this section. In accordance with Sec. 1.263(a)- 1(f)(3)(iv), G may deduct the amounts paid for all 50 scanners under  Sec. 1.162-1 in the taxable year the amounts are paid.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9 Unit of property that costs $200 or less; bulk purchase. H  provides consulting services to its customers. In Year 1, H pays $500 to  purchase one box of 10 toner cartridges to use as needed for H's  printers. Assume each toner cartridge is a unit of property under Sec.  1.263(a)-3(e). In Year 1, H's employees place 8 of the toner cartridges  in printers in H's office, and store the remaining 2 cartridges for use  in a later taxable year. The toner cartridges are materials and supplies  under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section because even though purchased  in one box costing more than $200, the allocable cost of each unit of  property equals $50. Therefore, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section,  the $400 paid by H for 8 of the cartridges is deductible in Year 1, the  taxable year in which H first uses each of those cartridges. The amounts  paid by H for each of the remaining 2 cartridges ($50 each) are  deductible in the taxable year in which each cartridge is first used in  H's business.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10 Materials and supplies used in improvements; coordination  with Sec. 1.263(a)-3. J owns various machines that are used in its  business. Assume that each machine is a unit of property under Sec.  1.263(a)-3(e). In Year 1, J purchases a supply of spare parts for its  machines. J acquired the parts to use in the repair or maintenance of  the machines under Sec. 1.162-4 or in the improvement of the machines  under Sec. 1.263(a)-3. The spare parts are not rotable or temporary  spare parts under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In Year 2, J uses  all of these spare parts in an activity that improves a machine under  Sec. 1.263(a)-3. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the spare  parts purchased by J in Year 1 are materials and supplies. Under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the amounts paid for the spare parts  are otherwise deductible as materials and supplies in Year 2, the  taxable year in which J uses those parts. However, because these  materials and supplies are used to improve J's machine, J is required to  capitalize the amounts paid for those spare parts under Sec. 1.263(a)- 3.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11 Cost of producing materials and supplies; coordination  with section 263A. K is a manufacturer that produces liquid waste as  part of its operations. K determines that its current liquid waste  disposal process is inadequate. To remedy the problem, in Year 1, K  constructs a leaching pit to provide a draining area for the liquid  waste. Assume the leaching pit is a unit of property under Sec.  1.263(a)-3(e) and has an economic useful life of 12 months or less,  starting on the date that K begins to use the leaching pit as a draining  area. At the end of this period, K's factory will be connected to the  local sewer   system. In Year 2, K starts using the leaching pit in its operations.  The amounts paid to construct the leaching pit (including the direct and  allocable indirect costs of property produced under section 263A) are  amounts paid for a material or supply under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of  this section. However, the amounts paid to construct the leaching pit  may be subject to capitalization under section 263A if these amounts  comprise the direct or allocable indirect costs of property produced by  K.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12 Costs of acquiring materials and supplies for production  of property; coordination with section 263A. In Year 1, L purchases  jigs, dies, molds, and patterns for use in the manufacture of L's  products. Assume each jig, die, mold, and pattern is a unit of property  under Sec. 1.263(a)-3(e). The economic useful life of each jig, die,  mold, and pattern is 12 months or less, beginning when each item is used  in the manufacturing process. The jigs, dies, molds, and patterns are  not components acquired to maintain, repair, or improve any of L's  equipment under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. L begins using the  jigs, dies, molds and patterns in Year 2 to manufacture its products.  These items are materials and supplies under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of  this section. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the amounts paid  for the items are otherwise deductible in Year 2, the taxable year in  which L first uses those items. However, the amounts paid for these  materials and supplies may be subject to capitalization under section  263A if these amounts comprise the direct or allocable indirect costs of  property produced by L.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13 Election to capitalize and depreciate. M is in the mining  business. M acquires certain temporary spare parts, which it keeps on  hand to avoid operational time loss in the event it must make temporary  repairs to a unit of property that is subject to depreciation. These  parts are not used to improve property under Sec. 1.263(a)-3(d). These  temporary spare parts are used until a new or repaired part can be  installed and then are removed and stored for later temporary  installation. M does not use the optional method of accounting for  rotable and temporary spare parts in paragraph (e) of this section for  any of its rotable or temporary spare parts. The temporary spare parts  are materials and supplies under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.  Under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section, the amounts paid for  the temporary spare parts are deductible in the taxable year in which  they are disposed of by M. However, because it is unlikely that the  temporary spare parts will be disposed of in the near future, M would  prefer to treat the amounts paid for the spare parts as capital  expenditures subject to depreciation. M may elect under paragraph (d) of  this section to treat the cost of each temporary spare part as a capital  expenditure and as an asset subject to an allowance for depreciation. M  makes this election by capitalizing the amounts paid for each spare part  in the taxable year that M acquires the spare parts and by beginning to  recover the costs of each part on its timely filed Federal tax return  for the taxable year in which the part is placed in service for purposes  of determining depreciation under the applicable provisions of the  Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations. See Sec. 1.263(a)- 2(g) for the treatment of capital expenditures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> N provides  consulting services to its customers. In Year 1, N pays amounts to  purchase 50 laptop computers. Each laptop computer is a unit of property  under Sec. 1.263(a)-3(e), costs $400, and has an economic useful life  of more than 12 months. Also in Year 1, N purchases 50 office chairs to  be used by its employees. Each office chair is a unit of property that  costs $100. N has an applicable financial statement (as defined in Sec.  1.263(a)-1(f)(4)) and N has a written accounting policy at the beginning  Year 1 to expense amounts paid for units of property costing $500 or  less. N treats amounts paid for property costing $500 or less as an  expense on its applicable financial statement in Year 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The laptop computers are not materials or supplies under  paragraph (c) of this section. Therefore, the amounts N pays for the  computers must generally be capitalized under Sec. 1.263(a)-2(d) as  amounts paid for the acquisition of tangible property. The office chairs  are materials and supplies under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.  Thus, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the amounts paid for the  office chairs are deductible in the taxable year in which they are first  used in N's business. However, under paragraph (f) of this section, if N  properly elects to apply the de minimis safe harbor under Sec.  1.263(a)-1(f) to amounts paid in Year 1, then N must apply the de  minimis safe harbor under Sec. 1.263(a)-1(f) to amounts paid for the  computers and the office chairs, rather than treat the office chairs as  the costs of materials and supplies under Sec. 1.162-3. Under the de  minimis safe harbor, N may not capitalize the amounts paid for the  computers under Sec. 1.263(a)-2 nor treat the office chairs as  materials and supplies under Sec. 1.162-3. Instead, in accordance with  Sec. 1.263(a)-1(f)(3)(iv), under Sec. 1.162-1, N may deduct the  amounts paid for the computers and the office chairs in the taxable year  paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Accounting method changes. Except as otherwise provided in this  section, a change to comply with this section is a change in method of  accounting to which the provisions of sections 446 and 481 and the  accompanying regulations apply. A taxpayer seeking to change to a method  of accounting permitted in   this section must secure the consent of the Commissioner in accordance  with Sec. 1.446-1(e) and follow the administrative procedures issued  under Sec. 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii) for obtaining the Commissioner's consent  to change its accounting method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective/applicability date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section  generally applies to amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning  on or after January 1, 2014. However, a taxpayer may apply paragraph (e)  of this section (the optional method of accounting for rotable and  temporary spare parts) to taxable years beginning on or after January 1,  2014. Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(3) of this  section, Sec. 1.162-3 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as  of April 1, 2011, applies to taxable years beginning before January 1,  2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Early application of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except for  paragraph (e) of this section, a taxpayer may choose to apply this  section to amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning on or  after January 1, 2012. A taxpayer may choose to apply paragraph (e) of  this section (the optional method of accounting for rotable and  temporary spare parts) to taxable years beginning on or after January 1,  2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transition rule for election to capitalize materials and  supplies on 2012 and 2013 returns. If under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this  section, a taxpayer chooses to make the election to capitalize and  depreciate certain materials and supplies under paragraph (d) of this  section for its taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2012, and  ending on or before September 19, 2013 (applicable taxable year), and  the taxpayer did not make the election specified in paragraph (d)(3) of  this section on its timely filed original Federal tax return for the  applicable taxable year, the taxpayer must make the election specified  in paragraph (d)(3) of this section for the applicable taxable year by  filing an amended Federal tax return for the applicable taxable year on  or before 180 days from the due date including extensions of the  taxpayer's Federal tax return for the applicable taxable year,  notwithstanding that the taxpayer may not have extended the due date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>, as  contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2013, a taxpayer  makes the election under Sec. 1.162-3T(d) by capitalizing the amounts  paid to acquire or produce a material or supply in the taxable year the  amounts are paid and by beginning to depreciate the costs when the asset  is placed in service by the taxpayer for purposes of determining  depreciation under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue  Code and the Treasury Regulations. The election under Sec. 1.162-3T(d),  as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2013, does not  apply to an asset or a portion thereof placed in service and disposed of  in the same taxable year.
