Unless an unsafe condition is in evidence, vessel operations will not be  delayed while plans or other technical information are under review.  Plans, when required, shall normally include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One line electrical diagrams showing appropriate overload  protection as currently required by subchapter J (Electrical  Engineering) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Plans showing hydraulic or pneumatic equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Stress and/or arrangement diagrams with supporting design  calculations as appropriate to the specific equipment in question.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When weight handling gear is built to a recognized code or  specification, plans or other technical data will not normally be  required. Purchase specification or vendor's information may be accepted  in lieu of design calculations if sufficiently definitive of materials,  design (safety) factors and operating limitations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Design information, when required, will be evaluated against the  following minimum design criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wet Weight Handling Gear: Wet gear shall be considered to  consist of   gear used to lower equipment, apparatus or objects beneath the surface  of the water or for trailing objects, where the wire rope or cable is  payed out beneath the surface and becomes part of the line pull at the  head sheave or winch drum. Wet gear shall be designed, as a minimum, to  withstand and operate in excess of the breaking strength of the  strongest section or wire to be used in any condition of loading. The  safety factor for all metal structural parts shall be a minimum of 1.5;  i.e., the yield strength of the material shall be at least 1.5 times the  calculated stresses resulting from application of a load equal to the  nominal breaking strength of the strongest section or wire rope to be  used. Suitable assumptions for the actual loading conditions shall be  used in the design of wet gear. The lead of the wire rope from the head  sheave or winch drum shall be considered to vary from the vertical and  in azimuth in a manner to represent the most adverse loading condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other weight handling gear will be evaluated on the basis of the  standards of a recognized organization or association recognized by the  Commandant under Sec. 31.10-6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hydraulic or pneumatic systems will be evaluated on the basis of  Subchapter F (Marine Engineering) of this chapter.
