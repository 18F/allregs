                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Background samples are produced by continuously drawing a sample of dilution air during the exhaust collection phase of each test cycle mode.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Individual background samples may be produced and analyzed for each mode. Hence, a unique background value will be used for the emission calculations for each mode.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternatively, a single background sample may be produced by drawing a sample during the collection phase of each of the test cycle modes. Hence, a single cumulative background value will be used for the emission calculations for each mode.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For analysis of the individual sample described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a single value representing the average chart deflection over a 10-second stabilized period is stored. All readings taken during the 10-second interval must be stable at the final value to within [1 percent of full scale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Measure HC, CO, CO2, and NOX exhaust and background concentrations in the sample bag(s) with approximately the same flow rates and pressures used during calibration.
