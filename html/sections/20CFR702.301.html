                                Sec. 702.301  Scope of this subpart.

                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in this subpart govern the adjudication of claims in  which the employer has filed a notice of controversion under Sec.  702.251, or the employee has filed notice of contest under Sec.  702.261. In the vast majority of cases, the problem giving rise to the  controversy results from misunderstandings, clerical or mechanical  errors, or mistakes of fact or law. Such problems seldom require  resolution through formal hearings, with the attendant production of  expert witnesses. Accordingly, by Sec. 702.311 et seq., the district  directors are empowered to amicably and promptly resolve such problems  by informal procedures. Where there is a genuine dispute of fact or law  which cannot be so disposed of informally, resort must be had to the  formal hearing procedures as set forth beginning at Sec. 702.331.  Supplementary compensation orders, modifications, and interlocutory  matters are governed by regulations beginning with Sec. 702.371.  Thereafter, appeals from compensation orders are discussed beginning  with Sec. 702.391 (the regulations of the Benefits Review Board are set  forth in full in part 802 of this title).</p><p class="depth0">Action by District Directors</p>
