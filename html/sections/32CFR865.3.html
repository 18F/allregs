Depending  on the circumstances, a child, spouse, civilian employee or former  civilian employee, former spouse, parent or other close relative, an  heir, or a legal representative (such as a guardian or executor) of the  member or former member may be able to show a proper interest.  Applicants will send proof of proper interest with the application when  requesting correction of another person's military records. An  application may be returned when proper interest has not been shown.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A member, former member, employee or former employee, dependent,  and current or former spouse may apply to correct a document or other  record of any other military matter that affects them (This does not  include records pertaining to civilian employment matters). Applicants  will send proof of the effect of the document or record upon them with  the application when requesting a correction under this provision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Getting forms.

Ordinarily, applicants must file an  application within 3 years after the error or injustice was discovered,  or, with due diligence, should have been discovered. In accordance with  federal law, time on active duty is not included in the 3 year period.  An application filed later is untimely and may be denied by the Board on  that basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Board may excuse untimely filing in the interest of justice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the application is filed late, applicants should explain why  it would be in the interest of justice for the Board to waive the time  limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Stay of other proceedings.

Applicants may withdraw an application  at any time before the Board's decision. Withdrawal does not stay the 3- year time limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Authority to reject applications.
