Acidified sour cream results from the souring of  pasteurized cream with safe and suitable acidifiers, with or without  addition of lactic acid producing bacteria. Acidified sour cream  contains not less than 18 percent milkfat; except that when the food is  characterized by the addition of nutritive sweeteners or bulky flavoring  ingredients, the weight of milkfat is not less than 18 percent of the  remainder obtained by subtracting the weight of such optional  ingredients from the weight of the food; but in no case does the food  contain less than 14.4 percent milkfat. Acidified sour cream has a  titratable acidity of not less than 0.5 percent, calculated as lactic  acid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Optional ingredients. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Safe and suitable ingredients that  improve texture, prevent syneresis, or extend the shelf life of the  product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rennet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Safe and suitable nutritive sweeteners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Salt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Flavoring ingredients, with or without safe and suitable  coloring, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fruit and fruit juice, including concentrated fruit and fruit  juice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Safe and suitable natural and artificial food flavoring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> (1)  and (2) of this section are from ``Official Methods of Analysis of the  Association of Official Analytical Chemists,'' 13th Ed.
