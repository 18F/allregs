A  licensee that seeks to enter into a spectrum manager leasing arrangement  must notify the Commission of the arrangement in advance of the spectrum  lessee's commencement of operations under the lease. Unless the license  covering the spectrum to be leased is held pursuant to the Commission's  designated entity rules and continues to be subject to unjust enrichment  requirements and/or transfer restrictions (see Secs. 1.2110 and 1.2111,  and Secs. 24.709, 24.714, and 24.839 of this chapter), the spectrum  manager lease notification will be processed pursuant to either the  general notification procedures or the immediate processing procedures,  as set forth herein. The licensee must submit the notification to the  Commission by electronic filing using the Universal Licensing System  (ULS) and FCC Form 608, except that a licensee falling within the  provisions of Sec. 1.913(d) of this chapter may file the notification  either electronically or manually. If the license covering the spectrum  to be leased is held pursuant to the Commission's designated entity  rules, the spectrum manager lease will require Commission acceptance of  the spectrum manager lease notification prior to the commencement of  operations under the lease.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p>
