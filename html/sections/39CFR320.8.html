                                Sec. 320.8  Suspension for international remailing.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> through (6) and Sec.  310.2(b)(1) through (6) of this chapter is suspended on all post routes  to permit the uninterrupted carriage of letters from a point within the  United States to a foreign country for deposit in its domestic or  international mails for delivery to an ultimate destination outside the  United States.</p><p class="depth2">Example (1). The letters to overseas customers of commercial firm A  in Chicago are carried by Carrier B to New York where they are delivered  to Carrier C for carriage to Europe. Carrier C holds the letters in its  distribution center overnight, then sorts them by country of destination  and merges them with letters of other firms to those countries before  starting the carriage to Europe in the morning. The carriage of firm A's  letters is not interrupted. The suspension for international remailing  applies to the carriage by Carrier B and by Carrier C.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2). The bills addressed to foreign customers of the Chicago  branch office of commercial firm D are carried by Carrier E to New York  where they are delivered to the accounting department of firm D's home  office. The accounting department uses the information in the bills to  prepare its reports of accounts receivable. The bills are then returned  to Carrier E which carries them directly to Europe where they are  entered into the mails of a foreign country. The carriage of the bills  from Chicago to Europe is interrupted in New York by the delivery to  firm D's home office. The suspension for international remailing does  not apply to the carriage from Chicago to New York. It does apply to the  subsequent carriage from New York to Europe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This suspension shall not permit the shipment or carriage of a  letter or letters out of the mails to any foreign country for subsequent  delivery to an address within the United States.</p><p class="depth2">Example (1). A number of promotional letters originated by firm F in  Los Angeles are carried by Carrier G to Europe for deposit in the mails  of a foreign country. Some of the letters are addressed to persons in  Europe, some to persons in the United States. The suspension for  international remailing does not apply to the letters addressed to  persons in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> and shall shift to the shipper or  carrier the burden of establishing the fact of compliance. Revocation of  this suspension as to a shipper or carrier shall in no way limit other  actions as to such shipper or carrier to enforce the Private Express  Statutes by administrative proceedings for collection of postage (see  Sec. 310.5) or by civil or criminal proceedings.
