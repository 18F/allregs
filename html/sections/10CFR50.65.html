These goals shall be established commensurate with safety and, where practical, take into account industry-wide operating experience. When the performance or condition of a structure, system, or component does not meet established goals, appropriate corrective action shall be taken. For a nuclear power plant for which the licensee has submitted the certifications specified in Sec. 50.82(a)(1) or 52.110(a)(1) of this chapter, as applicable, this section shall only apply to the extent that the licensee shall monitor the performance or condition of all structures, systems, or components associated with the storage, control, and maintenance of spent fuel in a safe condition, in a manner sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that these structures, systems, and components are capable of fulfilling their intended functions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each holder of an operating license for a nuclear power plant under this part and each holder of a combined license under part 52 of this chapter after the Commission makes the finding under Sec. 52.103(g) of this chapter, shall monitor the performance or condition of structures, systems, or components, against licensee-established goals, in a manner sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that these structures, systems, and components, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, are capable of fulfilling their intended functions.

The evaluations shall take into account, where practical, industry-wide operating experience. Adjustments shall be made where necessary to ensure that the objective of preventing failures of structures, systems, and components through maintenance is appropriately balanced against the objective of minimizing unavailability of structures, systems, and components due to monitoring or preventive maintenance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Before performing maintenance activities (including but not limited to surveillance, post-maintenance testing, and corrective and preventive maintenance), the licensee shall assess and manage the increase in risk that may result from the proposed maintenance activities. The scope of the assessment may be limited to structures, systems,

and components that a risk-informed evaluation process has shown to be significant to public health and safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The scope of the monitoring program specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall include safety related and nonsafety related structures, systems, and components, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Safety-related structures, systems and components that are relied upon to remain functional during and following design basis events to ensure the integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary, the capability to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition, or the capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of accidents that could result in potential offsite exposure comparable to the guidelines in Sec. 50.34(a)(1), Sec. 50.67(b)(2), or Sec. 100.11 of this chapter, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nonsafety related structures, systems, or components:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That are relied upon to mitigate accidents or transients or are used in plant emergency operating procedures (EOPs); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whose failure could prevent safety-related structures, systems, and components from fulfilling their safety-related function; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whose failure could cause a reactor scram or actuation of a safety-related system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The requirements of this section shall be implemented by each licensee no later than July 10, 1996.
