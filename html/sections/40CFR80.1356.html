(1) Obtain and read a copy of the refinery's or importer's annual reports and batch reports filed with EPA for 2004 and 2005 that contain gasoline benzene and gasoline volume information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain and read a copy of the refinery's or importer's annual reports and batch reports filed with EPA for 2004 and 2005 that contain gasoline benzene and gasoline volume information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agree the yearly volumes of gasoline and benzene concentration, in volume percent and benzene gallons, reported to EPA in the reports specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section with the inventory reconciliation analysis under Sec. 80.128.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Verify that the information in the refinery's or importer's batch reports filed with EPA under Sec. Sec. 80.75 and 80.105, and any laboratory test results, agree with the information contained in the reports specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Calculate the average benzene concentration for all of the refinery's or importer's gasoline volume over 2004 and 2005 and verify that those values agree with the values reported to EPA per Sec. 80.1285.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Baseline for Early Credit Generation. Take the following steps for the first attest reporting period following approval of a benzene baseline:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain the EPA benzene baseline approval letter for the refinery to determine the refinery's applicable benzene baseline under Sec. 80.1285.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Obtain a written statement from the company representative identifying the benzene value used as the refinery's baseline and agree that number to paragraph (b)(1) of this section and to the reports to EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Early Credit Generation. The following procedures shall be completed for a refinery or importer that generates early benzene credits per Sec. 80.1275:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain the baseline benzene concentration and gasoline volume from paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Obtain the annual benzene report per Sec. 80.1354.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the benzene value under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is at least 10 percent less than the value in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, compute and report as a finding the difference according to Sec. 80.1275.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Compute and report as a finding the total number of benzene credits generated by multiplying the value calculated in paragraph (c)(3) of this section by the volume of gasoline listed in the report specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and agree this number with the number reported to EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Standard Credit Generation. The following procedures shall be completed for a refinery or importer that generates benzene credits per Sec. 80.1290:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain the annual average benzene value from the annual benzene report per Sec. 80.1285.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the annual average benzene value under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is less than 0.62 percent by volume, compute and report as a finding the difference according to Sec. 80.1290.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compute and report as a finding the total number of benzene credits generated by multiplying the value calculated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section by the volume of gasoline listed in the report specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and agree this number with the number reported to EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Credits Required. The following attest procedures shall be completed for refineries and importers:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain the annual average benzene concentration and volume from the annual benzene report per Sec. 80.1285.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the value in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is greater than 0.62 percent by volume, compute and report as a finding the difference between 0.62 percent by volume and the value in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compute and report as a finding the total benzene credits required by multiplying the value in paragraph (e)(2) of this section times the volume of gasoline in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and agree this number with the report to EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Obtain a statement from the refiner or importer as to the portion of the deficit under paragraph (e)(3) of this section that was resolved with credits, or that was carried forward as a deficit under Sec. 80.1230(b), and agree these figures with the report to EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Credit Purchases and Sales. The following attest procedures shall be completed for a refinery or importer that is a transferor or transferee of credits during an averaging period:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain contracts or other documents for all credits transferred to another refinery or importer during the year being reviewed; compute and report as a finding the number and year of creation of credits represented in these documents as being transferred; and agree these figures with the report to EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Obtain contracts or other documents for all credits received during the year being reviewed; compute and report as a finding the number and year of creation of credits represented in these documents as being received; and agree with the report to EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Credit Reconciliation.
