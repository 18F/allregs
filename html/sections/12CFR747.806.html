A party  who has submitted documentary evidence or testimony in a formal  investigative proceeding shall be entitled, upon written request, to  procure a copy of his or her documentary evidence or a transcript of his  or her testimony on payment of the appropriate fees; provided, however,  that in a non-public formal investigative proceeding the NCUA Board may  for good cause deny such request or the NCUA Board may place reasonable  limitations upon the use of the documentary evidence and transcript. In  any event, any witness, upon proper identification, shall have the right  to inspect the official transcript of the witness's own testimony.</p>
