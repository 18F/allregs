                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For payments for outcome payment months, both EN payment systems use the payment calculation base as defined in Sec. 411.500(a)(1) or (a)(2), as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> Under the outcome payment system, we can pay up to 36 outcome payments to the EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN) for a title II disability beneficiary (including a concurrent title II/title XVI disability beneficiary). We can pay up to 60 outcome payments to the EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN) for a title XVI disability beneficiary who is not concurrently a title II disability beneficiary. For each month during the beneficiary's outcome payment period for which Social Security disability benefits and Federal SSI cash benefits are not payable to the beneficiary because of the performance of SGA or by reason of earnings from work activity, the EN (or the State VR agency acting as an EN) is eligible for a monthly outcome payment. Payment for an outcome payment month under the outcome payment system is equal to 67% of the payment calculation base for the calendar year in which such month occurs, rounded to the nearest whole dollar (see Sec. 411.550).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Under the outcome payment system, we can pay up to 36 outcome payments to the EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN) for a title II disability beneficiary (including a concurrent title II/title XVI disability beneficiary). We can pay up to 60 outcome payments to the EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN) for a title XVI disability beneficiary who is not concurrently a title II disability beneficiary. For each month during the beneficiary's outcome payment period for which Social Security disability benefits and Federal SSI cash benefits are not payable to the beneficiary because of the performance of SGA or by reason of earnings from work activity, the EN (or the State VR agency acting as an EN) is eligible for a monthly outcome payment. Payment for an outcome payment month under the outcome payment system is equal to 67% of the payment calculation base for the calendar year in which such month occurs, rounded to the nearest whole dollar (see Sec. 411.550).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a disabled beneficiary's entitlement to Social Security disability benefits ends (see Secs. 404.316(b), 404.337(b) and 404.352(b) of this chapter) or eligibility for SSI benefits based on disability or blindness terminates (see Sec. 416.1335 of this chapter) because of the performance of SGA or by reason of earnings from work activity, we will consider any month after the month with which such entitlement ends or eligibility terminates to be a month for which Social Security disability benefits and Federal SSI cash benefits are not payable to the individual because of work or earnings if--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The individual has gross earnings from employment (or net earnings from self-employment as defined in Sec. 416.1110(b) of this chapter) in that month that are more than the SGA threshold amount in Sec. 404.1574(b)(2) of this chapter (or in Sec. 404.1584(d) of this chapter for an individual who is statutorily blind); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The individual is not entitled to any monthly benefits under title II or eligible for any benefits under title XVI for that month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under the outcome-milestone payment system:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> We can pay the EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN) for up to four Phase 1 milestones attained within the required earnings period for a title II or title XVI disability beneficiary who has assigned his or her ticket to the EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN). The first Phase 1 milestone is met when a beneficiary has worked in a month and earned at least 50% of the amount of earnings considered to represent a trial work period service month as defined in Sec. 404.1592(b) of this chapter. The second Phase 1 milestone is met after a beneficiary has worked for three months within a six-month period and has gross earnings in each of those three months equal to or greater than a trial work period service amount as defined in Sec. 404.1592(b) of this chapter. The third Phase 1 milestone is met after a beneficiary has worked for a total of six months within a twelve-month period and had gross earnings in each of those six months equal to a trial work period service amount as defined in Sec. 404.1592(b) of this chapter. The fourth Phase 1 milestone is met after a beneficiary has worked a total of nine months within an 18-month period and had gross earnings in each of those nine months equal to a trial work period service amount as defined in Sec. 404.1592(b) of this chapter and the EN has substantially completed the services agreed to in the IWP/IPE, including any amendments. Earnings used to meet the first, second or third Phase 1 milestone may be counted again when

determining if a later Phase 1 milestone is met, provided the earlier earnings fall within the relevant time period for meeting the later milestone.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> We can also pay the EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN) up to eleven Phase 2 milestones achieved by a title II disability beneficiary (including a concurrent title II/title XVI disability beneficiary) or up to eighteen Phase 2 milestones achieved by a title XVI disability beneficiary (who is not concurrently a title II disability beneficiary) who has assigned his or her ticket to the EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN). A Phase 2 milestone is met for each calendar month in which the beneficiary has worked and has gross earnings from employment (or net earnings from self-employment as defined in Sec. 404.1080 of this chapter) in that month that are more than the SGA threshold amount as defined in Sec. 404.1574 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> We pay available milestone payments in sequence except when the beneficiary's outcome period begins before the beneficiary has achieved all Phase 1 and Phase 2 milestones. Example: The individual, in the first month of employment after assigning the ticket, earns above the SGA level. Despite having exceeded trial work period level earnings and earned above the SGA level as required for Phase 2 payments in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, based on the individual's earning we would pay the EN the sequentially available milestone, which in this case would be Phase 1, milestone 1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In addition to the milestone payments, monthly outcome payments can be paid to the EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN) during the outcome payment period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The outcome-milestone payment system is designed so that the total payments to the EN (or the State VR agency acting as an EN) for a beneficiary are less than the total amount that would have been paid if the EN were paid under the outcome payment system. Under the outcome-milestone payment system, the total payment to the EN (or the State VR agency acting as an EN) is about 90% of the total that would have been potentially payable under the outcome payment system for the same beneficiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 411.536 (reconciliation payments) the milestones for which payments may be made must occur prior to the beginning of the beneficiary's outcome payment period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We will pay an EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN) to which the beneficiary has assigned a ticket for milestones or outcomes achieved only in months prior to the month in which the ticket terminates (see Sec. 411.155). We will not pay a milestone or outcome payment to an EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN) based on a beneficiary's work or earnings activity in or after the month in which the ticket terminates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a title XVI disability beneficiary becomes entitled to title II benefits after we authorize the first milestone or outcome payment, we will continue to calculate the EN payments using title XVI payment calculation base under the outcome payment system on the basis of paragraph (a)(1)(i) and under the outcome-milestone payment system on the basis of paragraph (a)(2). This applies even if the title XVI eligibility is subsequently terminated and the person becomes only a title II beneficiary.
