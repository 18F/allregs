                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exchange limits. Each contract market as a condition of  designation under part 5, appendix A, of this chapter shall be bylaw,  rule, regulation, or resolution limit the maximum number of contracts a  person may hold or control, separately or in combination, net long or  net short, for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery  or, on a futures-equivalent basis, options thereon. This section shall  not apply to a contract market for which position limits are set forth  in Sec. 150.2 of this part or for a futures or option contract market  on a major foreign currency, for which there is no legal impediment to  delivery and for which there exists a highly liquid cash market. Nothing  in this section shall be construed to prohibit a contract market from  fixing different and separate position limits for different types of  futures contracts based on the same commodity, or from fixing different  position limits for different futures or for different delivery months,  or from exempting positions which are normally known in the trade as  ``spreads, straddles, or arbitrage,'' of from fixing limits which apply  to such positions which are different from limits fixed for other  positions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Levels at designation. At the time of its initial designation, a  contract market must provide for speculative position limit levels as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For physical delivery contracts, the spot month limit level must  be no greater than one-quarter of the estimated spot month deliverable  supply, calculated separately for each month to be listed, and for cash  settled contracts, the spot month limit level must be no greater than  necessary to minimize the potential for manipulation or distortion of  the contract's or the underlying commodity's price;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Individual nonspot or all-months-combined levels must be no  greater than 1,000 contracts for tangible commodities other than energy  products;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Individual nonspot or all-months-combined levels must be no  greater than 5,000 contracts for energy products and nontangible  commodities, including contracts on financial products.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjustments to levels. Contract markets may adjust their  speculative limit levels as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For physical delivery contracts, the spot month limit level must  be no greater than one-quarter of the estimated spot month deliverable  supply, calculated separately for each month to be listed, and for cash  settled contracts, the spot month limit level must be no greater than  necessary to minimize the potential for manipulation or distortion of  the contract's or the underlying commodity's price; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Individual nonspot or all-months-combined levels must be no  greater than 10% of the average combined futures and delta-adjusted  option month-end open interest for the most recent calendar year up to  25,000 contracts with a marginal increase of 2.5% thereafter or be based  on position sizes customarily held by speculative traders on the  contract market, which shall not be extraordinarily large relative to  total open positions in the contract, the breadth and liquidity of the  cash market underlying each delivery month and the opportunity for  arbitrage between the futures market and the cash market in the  commodity underlying the futures contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Hedge exemption. (1) No exchange bylaw, rule, regulation, or  resolution adopted pursuant to this section shall apply to bona fide  hedging positions as defined by a contract market in accordance with  Sec. 1.3(z)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this chapter. Provided, however, that the contract  market may limit bona fide hedging positions or any other positions  which have been exempted pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section which  it determines are not in accord with sound commercial practices or  exceed an amount which may be established and liquidated in an orderly  fashion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Traders must apply to the contract market for exemption from its  speculative position limit rules. In considering whether to grant such  an application for exemption, contract markets must take into account  the factors contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Trader accountability exemption. Twelve months after a contract  market's initial listing for trading or at any time thereafter, contract  markets may submit for Commission approval under section 5a(a)(12) of  the Act and Sec. 1.41(b) of this chapter a bylaw, rule, regulation, or  resolution, substituting for the position limits required under  paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section an exchange rule requiring  traders to be accountable for large positions as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For futures and option contracts on a financial instrument or  product having an average open interest of 50,000 contracts and an  average daily trading volume of 100,000 contracts and a very highly  liquid cash market, an exchange bylaw, regulation or resolution  requiring traders to provide information about their position upon  request by the exchange;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For futures and option contracts on a financial instrument or  product or on an intangible commodity having an average moth-end open  interest of 50,000 and an average daily volume of 25,000 contracts and a  highly liquid cash market, an exchange bylaw, regulation or resolution  requiring traders to provide information about their position upon  request by the exchange and to consent to halt increasing further a  trader's positions if so ordered by the exchange;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For futures and option contracts on a tangible commodity,  including but not limited to metals, energy products, or international  soft agricultural products, having an average month-end open interest of  50,000 contracts and an   average daily volume of 5,000 contracts and a liquid cash market, an  exchange bylaw, regulation or resolution requiring traders to provide  information about their position upon request by the exchange and to  consent to halt increasing further a trader's positions if so ordered by  the exchange, provided, however, such contract markets are not exempt  from the requirement of paragraphs (b) or (c) that they adopt an  exchange bylaw, regulation or resolution setting a spot month  speculative position limit with a level no grater than one quarter of  the estimated spot month deliverable supply;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of this paragraph, trading volume and open interest  shall be calculated by combining the month-end futures and its related  option contract, on a delta-adjusted basis, for all months listed during  the most recent calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Other exemptions. Exchange speculative position limits adopted  pursuant to this section shall not apply to any position acquired in  good faith prior to the effective date of any bylaw, rule, regulation,  or resolution which specifies such limit or to a person that is  registered as a futures commission merchant or as a floor broker under  authority of the Act except to the extent that transactions made by such  person are made on behalf of or for the account or benefit of such  person. In addition to the express exemptions specified in this section,  a contract market may propose such other exemptions from the  requirements of this section consistent with the purposes of this  section and shall submit such rules Commission review under section  5a(1)(12) of the Act and Sec. 1.41(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Aggregation. In determining whether any person has exceeded the  limits established under this section, all positions in accounts for  which such person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or  indirectly controls trading shall be included with the positions held by  such person; such limits upon positions shall apply to positions held by  two or more person acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or  understanding, the same as if the positions were held by a single  person.
