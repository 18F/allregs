                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this part have the following meanings:</p><p class="depth0">Act. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</p><p class="depth0">Advanced intelligent network. Advanced intelligent network is a telecommunications network architecture in which call processing, call routing, and network management are provided by means of centralized databases located at points in an incumbent local exchange carrier's network.</p><p class="depth0">Advanced services. The term ``advanced services'' is defined as high speed, switched, broadband, wireline telecommunications capability that enables users to originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics or video telecommunications using any technology.</p><p class="depth0">Arbitration, final offer. Final offer arbitration is a procedure under which each party submits a final offer concerning the issues subject to arbitration, and the arbitrator selects, without modification, one of the final offers by the parties to the arbitration or portions of both such offers. ``Entire package final offer arbitration,'' is a procedure under which the arbitrator must select, without modification, the entire proposal submitted by one of the parties to the arbitration. ``Issue-by-issue final offer arbitration,'' is a procedure under which the arbitrator must select, without modification, on an issue-by-issue

basis, one of the proposals submitted by the parties to the arbitration.</p><p class="depth0">Billing. Billing involves the provision of appropriate usage data by one telecommunications carrier to another to facilitate customer billing with attendant acknowledgements and status reports. It also involves the exchange of information between telecommunications carriers to process claims and adjustments.</p><p class="depth0">Binder or binder group. Copper pairs bundled together, generally in groups of 25, 50 or 100.</p><p class="depth0">Business line. A business line is an incumbent LEC-owned switched access line used to serve a business customer, whether by the incumbent LEC itself or by a competitive LEC that leases the line from the incumbent LEC. The number of business lines in a wire center shall equal the sum of all incumbent LEC business switched access lines, plus the sum of all UNE loops connected to that wire center, including UNE loops provisioned in combination with other unbundled elements. Among these requirements, business line tallies:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Shall include only those access lines connecting end-user customers with incumbent LEC end-offices for switched services,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Shall not include non-switched special access lines,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Shall account for ISDN and other digital access lines by counting each 64 kbps-equivalent as one line. For example, a DS1 line corresponds to 24 64 kbps-equivalents, and therefore to 24 ``business lines.''</p><p class="depth0">Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS). CMRS has the same meaning as that term is defined in Sec. 20.3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Commingling. Commingling means the connecting, attaching, or otherwise linking of an unbundled network element, or a combination of unbundled network elements, to one or more facilities or services that a requesting telecommunications carrier has obtained at wholesale from an incumbent LEC, or the combining of an unbundled network element, or a combination of unbundled network elements, with one or more such facilities or services. Commingle means the act of commingling.</p><p class="depth0">Commission. Commission refers to the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p class="depth0">Day. Day means calendar day.</p><p class="depth0">Dialing parity. The term dialing parity means that a person that is not an affiliate of a local exchange carrier is able to provide telecommunications services in such a manner that customers have the ability to route automatically, without the use of any access code, their telecommunications to the telecommunications service provider of the customer's designation from among 2 or more telecommunications service providers (including such local exchange carrier).</p><p class="depth0">Directory assistance service. Directory assistance service includes, but is not limited to, making available to customers, upon request, information contained in directory listings.</p><p class="depth0">Directory listings. Directory listings are any information:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Identifying the listed names of subscribers of a telecommunications carrier and such subscriber's telephone numbers, addresses, or primary advertising classifications (as such classifications are assigned at the time of the establishment of such service), or any combination of such listed names, numbers, addresses or classifications; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> That the telecommunications carrier or an affiliate has published, caused to be published, or accepted for publication in any directory format.</p><p class="depth0">Downstream database. A downstream database is a database owned and operated by an individual carrier for the purpose of providing number portability in conjunction with other functions and services.</p><p class="depth0">Enhanced extended link. An enhanced extended link or EEL consists of a combination of an unbundled loop and unbundled dedicated transport, together with any facilities, equipment, or functions necessary to combine those network elements.</p><p class="depth0">Equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements. For purposes of section 251(c)(2) of the Act, the equipment used to interconnect with an incumbent local exchange carrier's network for the transmission and routing of telephone

exchange service, exchange access service, or both. For the purposes of section 251(c)(3) of the Act, the equipment used to gain access to an incumbent local exchange carrier's unbundled network elements for the provision of a telecommunications service.</p><p class="depth0">Fiber-based collocator. A fiber-based collocator is any carrier, unaffiliated with the incumbent LEC, that maintains a collocation arrangement in an incumbent LEC wire center, with active electrical power supply, and operates a fiber-optic cable or comparable transmission facility that</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Terminates at a collocation arrangement within the wire center;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Leaves the incumbent LEC wire center premises; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Is owned by a party other than the incumbent LEC or any affiliate of the incumbent LEC, except as set forth in this paragraph. Dark fiber obtained from an incumbent LEC on an indefeasible right of use basis shall be treated as non-incumbent LEC fiber-optic cable. Two or more affiliated fiber-based collocators in a single wire center shall collectively be counted as a single fiber-based collocator. For purposes of this paragraph, the term affiliate is defined by 47 U.S.C. 153(1) and any relevant interpretation in this Title.</p><p class="depth0">Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (Incumbent LEC).

Interconnection, access to unbundled network elements, collocation, and other methods of achieving interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at a point in the network shall be deemed technically feasible absent technical or operational concerns that prevent the fulfillment of a request by a telecommunications carrier for such interconnection, access, or methods. A determination of technical feasibility does not include consideration of economic, accounting, billing, space, or site concerns, except that space and site concerns may be considered in circumstances where there is no possibility of expanding the space available. The fact that an incumbent LEC must modify its facilities or equipment to respond to such request does not determine whether satisfying such request is technically feasible. An incumbent LEC that claims that it cannot satisfy such request because of adverse network reliability impacts must prove to the state commission by clear and convincing evidence that such interconnection, access, or methods would result in specific and significant adverse network reliability impacts.</p><p class="depth0">Telecommunications carrier. A telecommunications carrier is any provider of telecommunications services, except that such term does not include aggregators of telecommunications services (as defined in section 226 of the

Act).

This definition includes CMRS providers, interexchange carriers (IXCs) and, to the extent they are acting as telecommunications carriers, companies that provide both telecommunications and information services. Private Mobile Radio Service providers are telecommunications carriers to the extent they provide domestic or international telecommunications for a fee directly to the public.</p><p class="depth0">Telecommunications service. The term telecommunications service refers to the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless of the facilities used.</p><p class="depth0">Telephone exchange service. A telephone exchange service is:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> A service within a telephone exchange, or within a connected system of telephone exchanges within the same exchange area operated to furnish to subscribers intercommunicating service of the character ordinarily furnished by a single exchange, and which is covered by the exchange service charge, or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A comparable service provided through a system of switches, transmission equipment, or other facilities (or combination thereof) by which a subscriber can originate and terminate a telecommunications service.</p><p class="depth0">Telephone toll service. The term telephone toll service refers to telephone service between stations in different exchange areas for which there is made a separate charge not included in contracts with subscribers for exchange service.</p><p class="depth0">Unreasonable dialing delay. For the same type of calls, dialing delay is ``unreasonable'' when the dialing delay experienced by the customer of a competing provider is greater than that experienced by a customer of the LEC providing dialing parity, or nondiscriminatory access to operator services or directory assistance.</p><p class="depth0">Triennial Review Order. The Triennial Review Order means the Commission's Report and Order and Order on Remand and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in CC Docket Nos. 01-338, 96-98, and 98-147.</p><p class="depth0">Triennial Review Remand Order.
