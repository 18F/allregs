                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Electronic billing and payment. We will deposit all funds collected under this part to the Radiological Emergency Preparedness Fund as offsetting collections, which will be available for our REP Program. The Department of the Treasury revisions to section 8025.30 of publication I-TFM 6-8000 require Federal agencies to collect funds by electronic funds transfer when such collection is cost-effective, practicable, and consistent with current statutory authority. Working with the Department of the Treasury we now provide for payment of bills by electronic transfers through Automated Clearing House (ACH) credit payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We will send bills that are based on the assessment methodology set out in Sec. 354.4 to licensees to recover the full amount of the funds that we budget to provide REP Program services. Licensees that have more than one site will receive consolidated bills. We will forward one bill to each licensee during the first quarter of the fiscal year, with payment due within 30 days. If we exceed our original budget for the fiscal year and need to make minor adjustments, the adjustment will appear in the bill for the next fiscal year.</p>
