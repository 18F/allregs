                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bidders shall not be required to furnish bid samples  unless there are characteristics of the product that cannot be described  adequately in the specification or purchase description.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bid samples will be used only to determine the responsiveness of  the bid and will not be used to determine a bidder's ability to produce  the required items.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Bid samples may be examined for any required characteristic,  whether or not such characteristic is adequately described in the  specification, if listed in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Bids will be rejected as nonresponsive if the sample fails to  conform to each of the characteristics listed in the invitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When to use. The use of bid samples would be appropriate for  products that must be suitable from the standpoint of balance, facility  of use, general ``feel,'' color, pattern, or other   characteristics that cannot be described adequately in the  specification. However, when more than a minor portion of the  characteristics of the product cannot be adequately described in the  specification, products should be acquired by two-step sealed bidding or  negotiation, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Justification. The reasons why acceptable products cannot be  acquired without the submission of bid samples shall be set forth in the  contract file, except where the submission is required by the formal  specifications (Federal, Military, or other) applicable to the  acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requirements for samples in invitations for bids. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Invitations for bids shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State the number and, if appropriate, the size of the samples to  be submitted and otherwise fully describe the samples required; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> List all the characteristics for which the samples will be  examined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If bid samples are required, see 14.201-6(o).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Waiver of requirement for bid samples. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The requirement for  furnishing bid samples may be waived when a bidder offers a product  previously or currently being contracted for or tested by the Government  and found to comply with specification requirements conforming in every  material respect with those in the current invitation for bids. When the  requirement may be waived, see 14.201-6(o)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where samples required by a Federal, Military, or other formal  specification are not considered necessary and a waiver of the sample  requirements of the specification has been authorized, a statement shall  be included in the invitation that notwithstanding the requirements of  the specification, samples will not be required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unsolicited samples. Bid samples furnished with a bid that are  not required by the invitation generally will not be considered as  qualifying the bid and will be disregarded. However, the bid sample will  not be disregarded if it is clear from the bid or accompanying papers  that the bidder's intention was to qualify the bid. (See 14.404-2(d) if  the qualification does not conform to the solicitation.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Handling bid samples. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Samples that are not destroyed in  testing shall be returned to bidders at their request and expense,  unless otherwise specified in the invitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disposition instructions shall be requested from bidders and  samples disposed of accordingly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Samples ordinarily will be returned collect to the address from  which received if disposition instructions are not received within 30  days. Small items may be returned by mail, postage prepaid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Samples that are to be retained for inspection purposes in  connection with deliveries shall be transmitted to the inspecting  activity concerned, with instructions to retain the sample until  completion of the contract or until disposition instructions are  furnished.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where samples are consumed or their usefulness is impaired by  tests, they will be disposed of as scrap unless the bidder requests  their return.
