                            <p class="depth0">Shelf-life items are classified as nonextendable (Type I) and  extendable (Type II). Type I items have a definite storage life after  which the item or material is considered to be no longer usable for its  primary function and should be discarded. Type II items are those for  which successive reinspection dates can be established when the items  have a continued usability as determined by examination based upon  criteria that have been agreed upon. Examples of Type I items are drugs  and medicines with certain characteristics. Examples of Type II items  are paint and ink.  [40 FR 59595, Dec. 29, 1975]</p>
