Any electronic record system used to  create, maintain, or transfer a record required to be maintained by this  part shall meet the following design requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The electronic record system shall be designed such that the  integrity of each record is maintained through appropriate levels of  security such as recognition of an electronic signature, or other means,  which uniquely identify the initiating person as the author of that  record. No two persons shall have the same electronic identity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The electronic system shall ensure that each record cannot be  modified, or replaced, once the record is transmitted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any amendment to a record shall be electronically stored apart  from the record which it amends. Each amendment to a record shall  uniquely identify the person making the amendment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The electronic system shall provide for the maintenance of  inspection records as originally submitted without corruption or loss of  data; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Policies and procedures shall be in place to prevent persons  from altering electronic records, or otherwise interfering with the  electronic system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Operational requirements. Any electronic record system used to  create, maintain, or transfer a record required to be maintained by this  part shall meet the following operating requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The electronic storage of any record required by this part shall  be initiated by the person performing the activity to which the record  pertains within 24 hours following the completion of the activity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each locomotive for which records of inspection or  maintenance required by this part are maintained electronically, the  electronic record system shall automatically notify the railroad each  time the locomotive is due for an inspection, or maintenance that the  electronic system is tracking. The automatic notification tracking  requirement does not apply to daily inspections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Accessibility and availability requirements. Any electronic  record system used to create, maintain, or transfer a record required to  be maintained by this part shall meet the following access and  availability requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 229.313(c)(2), the carrier shall  provide FRA with all electronic records maintained for compliance with  this part for any specific locomotives at any mechanical department  terminal upon request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Paper copies of electronic records and amendments to those  records that may be necessary to document compliance with this part,  shall be provided to FRA for inspection and copying upon request. Paper  copies shall be provided to FRA no later than 15 days from the date the  request is made; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspection records required by this part shall be available to  persons who performed the inspection and to persons performing  subsequent inspections on the same locomotive.
