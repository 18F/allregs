                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Distribution deadline--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Unless a notice of  noncompliance is issued under Sec. 4041.31(a), the plan administrator  must complete the distribution of plan assets in satisfaction of plan  benefits (through priority category 6 under section 4044 of ERISA and  part 4044 of this chapter) by the later of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 180 days after the expiration of the PBGC's 60-day (or extended)  review period under Sec. 4041.26(a); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the plan administrator meets the requirements of  Sec. 4041.25(c), 120 days after receipt of a favorable determination  from the IRS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Revocation of notice of noncompliance. If the PBGC revokes a  notice of noncompliance issued under Sec. 4041.31(a), the distribution  deadline is extended until the 180th day after the date of the  revocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assets insufficient to satisfy plan benefits. If, at the time of  any distribution, the plan administrator determines that plan assets are  not sufficient to satisfy all plan benefits (with assets determined net  of other liabilities, including PBGC premiums), the plan administrator  may not make any further distribution of assets to effect the plan's  termination and must promptly notify the PBGC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Method of distribution--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The plan administrator  must, in accordance with all applicable requirements under the Code and  ERISA, distribute plan assets in satisfaction of all plan benefits by  purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer or in another  permitted form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lump sum calculations. In the absence of evidence establishing  that another date is the ``annuity starting date'' under the Code, the  distribution date is the ``annuity starting date'' for purposes of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Calculating the present value of plan benefits that may be  provided in a form other than by purchase of an irrevocable commitment  from an insurer (e.g., in selecting the interest rate(s) to be used to  value a lump sum distribution); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determining whether plan benefits will be paid in such other  form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Selection of insurer. In the case of plan benefits that will be  provided by purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer, the  plan administrator must select the insurer in accordance with the  fiduciary standards of Title I of ERISA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Participating annuity contracts. In the case of a plan in which  any residual assets will be distributed to participants, a participating  annuity contract may be purchased to satisfy the requirement that  annuities be provided by the purchase of irrevocable commitments only if  the portion of the price of the contract that is attributable to the  participation feature--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is not taken into account in determining the amount of residual  assets; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is not paid from residual assets allocable to participants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Missing participants. The plan administrator must distribute  plan benefits to missing participants in accordance with part 4050.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Provision of annuity contract. If plan benefits are provided  through the purchase of irrevocable commitments--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Either the plan administrator or the insurer must, within 30  days after it is available, provide each participant and beneficiary  with a copy of the annuity contract or certificate showing the insurer's  name and address and clearly reflecting the insurer's obligation to  provide the participant's or beneficiary's plan benefits; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If such a contract or certificate is not provided to the  participant or beneficiary by the date on which the post-distribution  certification is required to be filed in order to avoid the assessment  of penalties under Sec. 4041.29(b), the plan administrator must, no  later than that date, provide the participant and beneficiary with a  notice that includes--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement that the obligation for providing the participant's  or beneficiary's plan benefits has transferred to the insurer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name and address of the insurer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the person  designated by the insurer to answer questions concerning the annuity;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement that the participant or beneficiary will receive  from the plan administrator or insurer a copy of the annuity contract or  a certificate showing the insurer's name and address and clearly  reflecting the insurer's obligation to provide the participant's or  beneficiary's plan benefits.</p>
