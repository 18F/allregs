                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application of section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Scope. Section 7654 and this section  set forth the general procedures to be followed by the Government of the  United   States and the Government of Guam in the division between the two  governments of revenue derived from collections of the income taxes  imposed for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1972, with  respect to any individual described in subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph (a), and paragraph (e) of this section. To the extent that  section 7654 and this section are inconsistent with the provisions of  section 30 of the Organic Act of Guam (48 U.S.C. 1421h), relating to  duties and taxes to be covered into the treasury of Guam and held in  account for the Government of Guam, such section 30 is superseded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of Sec. 1.935-1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations) and has  (or in the case of a joint return, such individual and his spouse  have)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Adjusted gross income of $50,000 or more, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Gross income of $5,000 or more from sources within the  jurisdiction (either the United States or Guam) other than the  jurisdiction with which the individual is required to file his income  tax return under paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.935-1 of this chapter.  For the determination of gross income and adjusted gross income see  sections 61 and 62, and the regulations thereunder, or, when applicable,  the corresponding provisions as made applicable in Guam by the Guam  Territorial income tax (48 U.S.C. 1421i). For purposes of this  paragraph, gross income consisting of compensation for military or naval  service shall be taken into account notwithstanding section 514 of the  Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 App. U.S.C. 574).  However, see paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allocation of tax. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Net collections of income taxes imposed  for each taxable year beginning after December 31, 1972, with respect to  each individual described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for such  year shall be divided between the United States and Guam by the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Commissioner of Revenue and  Taxation of Guam as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Net collections attributable to income from sources within the  United States shall be covered into the Treasury of the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Net collections attributable to income from sources within Guam  shall be covered into the treasury of Guam, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Net collections not described in subdivision (i) or (ii) of  this subparagraph (i.e., net collections attributable to income from  sources other than within the United States or Guam) shall be covered  into the treasury of the jurisdiction (either the United States or Guam)  with which the individual is required to file his return under paragraph  (b) of Sec. 1.935-1 of this chapter for such year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of tax of any individual for a taxable year which  shall be allocated to Guam for purposes of determining the portion of  the net collections from such individual which shall be covered into the  treasury of Guam by the United States for such year shall be that amount  which bears the same ratio to such amount of tax as the adjusted gross  income of that individual for such year which is allocable to sources in  Guam bears to the total adjusted gross income of such individual for  such year. For purposes of such allocation by the United States, the  adjusted gross income of the taxpayer shall be determined by taking into  account any compensation of any member of the Armed Forces for services  performed in Guam the withheld tax on which is paid into the treasury of  Guam pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The amount of tax of any  individual for any taxable year which shall be allocated to the United  States for purposes of determining the portion of the net collections  from such individual which shall be covered into the Treasury of the  United States by Guam for such year shall be that amount which bears the  same ratio to such amount of tax as the adjusted gross income of that  individual for such year which is allocable to sources in the United  States bears to the total adjusted gross income of such individual for  such year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions and special rules. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Net collections. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In determining net collections for a  taxable year, appropriate adjustment between the two jurisdictions shall  be made on a proportionate basis for underpayments of income taxes for  such taxable year, credits allowed against the income tax for such  taxable year (other than the credit for taxes withheld under section  3402 on wages), and refunds made of income taxes paid with respect to  such taxable year. Thus, if a net operating loss results in a carryback  to an earlier taxable year which gives rise to a refund for that earlier  year, an adjustment must be made based upon the proportion which the  amount of tax covered by one jurisdiction into the treasury of the other  jurisdiction for that earlier year bears to the total amount of tax paid  for that earlier year, even though the loss may have resulted from  activities in one jurisdiction and the income, against which the loss  was offset, was earned in the other jurisdiction. Similar adjustments  must be made for foreign tax credit carrybacks even though different  jurisdictions are involved. If, for example, an individual pays income  tax of $30,000 to the United States for 1974 and $10,000 of such tax is  covered into the treasury of Guam, and if for 1975 such individual has a  net operating loss attributable to a trade or business carried on in the  United States which loss is carried back to 1974 and gives rise to a  refund of $15,000 by the United States, Guam must cover into the  Treasury of the United States the amount of $5,000 which is the  adjustment based upon the refund ($15,000x$10,000/$30,000=$5,000).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of this subparagraph, any underpayment of tax is  treated as attributable on a pro rata basis to income from sources  within the United States, Guam, and sources other than within the United  States or Guam, respectively, and is divided between the United States  and Guam under the rules in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Income taxes. The term ``income taxes'' means--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> With respect to taxes imposed by the United States, the income  taxes imposed by chapter 1 of the Code, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to taxes imposed by Guam, the Guam Territorial  income tax (48 U.S.C. 1421i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Source rules. The determination of the source of income shall be  based on the principles contained in sections 861 through 863, and the  regulations thereunder, or, when applicable, in those sections as made  applicable in Guam by the Guam Territorial income tax. For such purposes  the provisions of section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief  Act of 1940 (50 App. U.S.C. 574) relating to the determination of the  source of income of members of the Armed Forces shall not be taken into  account. For purposes of this subparagraph, the provisions in section  935(c) treating Guam as part of the United States, and vice versa, do  not apply. For definition of the terms ``United States'' and ``Guam''  (see section 7701(a)(9) of the Code and section 2 of the Organic Act of  Guam (48 U.S.C. 1421).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Information return. Each individual described in paragraph  (a)(2) of this section for a taxable year who is required by paragraph  (b)(1) of Sec. 1.935-1 of this chapter to file his return of income for  such year with the United States shall timely file a properly executed  Form 5074 (Allocation of Individual Income Tax to Guam) by attaching  such form to his income tax return. Each individual described in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section for a taxable year who is required by  paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.935-1 of this chapter to file his return of  income for such year with Guam shall timely file such information as may  be required by the Commissioner of Revenue and Taxation with respect to  his income derived from sources within the United States. See section  6688 and Sec. 301.6688-1 for the penalty for failure to comply with  this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Military personnel in Guam. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue  shall arrange to pay to Guam the   amount of the taxes deducted and withheld by the United States under  section 3402 from wages paid to members of the Armed Forces who are  stationed in Guam but who have no income tax liability to Guam with  respect to such wages by reason of section 514 of the Soldiers' and  Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 App. U.S.C. 574). Section 514 of  that Act provides in effect that for purposes of the taxation of income  by Guam a person shall not be deemed to have lost a residence or  domicile in the United States solely by reason of being absent therefrom  in compliance with military or naval orders and the compensation for  military or naval service of such a person who is not a resident of, or  domiciled in, Guam shall not be deemed income for services performed  within, or from sources within, Guam. Any amount paid to Guam under this  paragraph in respect of a member of the Armed Forces described in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be taken into account in  determining the amount required to be covered into the treasury of Guam  under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. For purposes of this  paragraph, the term ``Armed Forces of the United States'' has the  meaning provided by Sec. 301.7701-8 of this chapter. This paragraph  does not apply to wages for services performed in Guam by members of the  Armed Forces of the United States which are not compensation for  military or naval service. In determining the amount of tax to be  covered into the treasury of Guam under this paragraph with respect to  remuneration for services performed in Guam by members of the Armed  Forces of the United States, the special procedure agreed upon with the  Department of Defense in 1951 shall not apply to remuneration paid after  December 31, 1974. Under that procedure the tax withheld under section  3402 upon such remuneration for services performed in Guam during April  and October of each year was to be projected for the appropriate six- month period of which the base month is a part, thereby arriving at an  estimated figure for semiannual withholding tax to be covered over.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transfers of funds. The transfers of funds between the United  States and Guam required to effectuate the provisions of this section  shall be made when convenient for the two governments, but not less  frequently than once in each calendar year. In complying with paragraph  (b) of this section, only net balances will be transferred between the  two governments. Further, amounts transferred pursuant to paragraph (b)  of this section may be determined on the basis of estimates rather than  the actual amounts derived from information furnished by taxpayers,  except that the net collections for 1973 and every third calendar year  thereafter are to be transferred on the basis of the information  furnished by taxpayers pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. In  order to facilitate the transfer of funds pursuant to this section, the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Commissioner of Revenue and  Taxation of Guam shall exchange such information, including copies of  income tax returns, as will ensure that the provisions of section 7654  and this section are being properly implemented.
