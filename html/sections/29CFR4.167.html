                                Sec. 4.167  Wage payments--medium of payment.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The wage payment requirements under the Act for monetary wages  specified under its provisions will be satisfied by the timely payment  of such wages to the employee either in cash or negotiable instrument  payable at par. Such payment must be made finally and unconditionally  and ``free and clear.'' Scrip, tokens, credit cards, ``dope checks'',  coupons, salvage material, and similar devices which permit the employer  to retain and prevent the employee from acquiring control of money due  for the work until some time after the pay day for the period in which  it was earned, are not proper mediums of payment under the Act. If, as  is permissible, they are used as a convenient device for measuring  earnings or allowable deductions during a single pay period, the  employee cannot be charged with the loss or destruction of any of them  and the employer may not, because the employee has not actually redeemed  them, credit itself with any which remain outstanding on the pay day in  determining whether it has met the requirements of the Act. The employer  may not include the cost of fringe benefits or equivalents furnished as  required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, as a credit toward the  monetary wages it is required to pay under section 2(a)(1) or 2(b) of  the Act (see Sec. 4.170). However, the employer may generally include,  as a part of the applicable minimum wage which it is required to pay  under the Act, the reasonable cost or fair value, as determined by the  Administrator, of furnishing an employee with ``board, lodging, or other  facilities,'' as defined in part 531 of this title, in situations where  such facilities are customarily furnished to employees, for the  convenience of the employees, not primarily for the benefit of the  employer, and the employees' acceptance of them is voluntary and  uncoerced. (See also Sec. 4.163(k).) The determination of reasonable  cost or fair value will be in accordance with the Administrator's  regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act, contained in such part  531 of this title. While employment on contracts subject to the Act  would not ordinarily involve situations in which service employees would  receive tips from third persons, the treatment of tips for wage purposes  in the situations where this may occur should be understood. For  purposes of this Act, tips may generally be included in wages in  accordance with the regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act,  contained in part 531. (See also Sec. 4.6(q) and Sec. 4.163(k).) The  general rule under that Act provides, when determining the wage an  employer is required to pay a tipped employee, the maximum allowable  hourly tip credit is limited to the   difference between $2.13 and the applicable minimum wage specified in  section 6(a)(1) of that Act. (See Sec. 4.163(k) for exceptions in  section 4(c) situations.) In no event shall the sum credited as tips  exceed the value of tips actually received by the employee. The tip  credit is not available to an employer unless the employer has informed  the employee of the tip credit provisions and all tips received by the  employee have been retained by the employee (other than as part of a  valid tip pooling arrangement among employees who customarily and  regularly receive tips; see section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards  Act).
