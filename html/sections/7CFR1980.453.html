                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Immediately after reviewing the conditions and requirements in Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-14 the lender and applicant should complete and sign the ``Acceptance of Conditions,'' and return a copy to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director. If certain conditions cannot be met, the lender and borrower may propose alternate conditions to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the lender indicates in the ``Acceptance of Conditions'' that it desires to obtain a Loan Note Guarantee and

subsequently decides at any time after receiving a conditional commitment that it no longer wants a Loan Note Guarantee, the lender will immediately advise the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director.</p><p class="depth2">Administrative</p><p class="depth2">A. The State Director will negotiate with the lender and proposed borrower any changes made to the initially issued or proposed Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-14. For loans requiring National Office concurrence, a copy of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-14 and any amendments thereto will be included when the loan file is submitted to the National Office for review. When the National Office recommends modifications or additions to Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-14, the State Director will further negotiate these recommendations with the lender and proposed borrower. If, as a result of these further negotiations, the lender, proposed borrower or State Director presents alternate conditions which would result in a change in the scope of the proposed project and if the loan exceeds the State Director's loan approval authority, the State Director will submit these conditions by memorandum to the National Office for consideration with a copy of the revised Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-14 and any amendments thereto. If the loan is within the State Director's loan approval authority, the State Director may approve such changes.</p><p class="depth2">B. On loan applications within the State Director's loan approval authority, the State Director will submit to the National Office, Business and Industry Division, within 30 days after the Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-14 has been accepted:</p><p class="depth2">1. A copy of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-29.</p><p class="depth2">2. A copy of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-14 is accepted by the lender and borrower.</p><p class="depth2">2. A copy of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Loan Review Board Minutes.</p><p class="depth2">4. Notification of required financial and other reports, their frequency, due dates and fiscal year-end.</p><p class="depth2">5. A copy of the proposed loan agreement between the lender and the borrower.</p><p class="depth2">6. When debt refinancing is involved, a copy of the justification for the refinancing.</p><p class="depth2">7. The cover memorandum should indicate whether the Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-34 has been issued. If the Loan Note Guarantee has been issued, enclose a copy of the Lender Certification required by Sec. 1980.60(a) of Subpart A of this part, and, if not, a proposed date for issuance of the Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-34.
