                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The NCP for each engine or vehicle for which a compliance level has been determined under Sec. 86.1112-87 is calculated according to the formula in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section depending on the value of the compliance level. Each formula contains an annual adjustment factor (AAFi) which is defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Other terms in the formulas are defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the compliance level (CL) is greater than the standard and less than or equal to X (e.g., point CL1 in figure 1), then:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.111

PR1 = (F) (MC50)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the compliance level is greater than X and less than or equal to the upper limit as determined by Sec. 86.1104-87 (e.g., point CL2 in figure 1), then:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.112
where:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.113</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> AAFi has the following values:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If fraci-1 = 0, then AAFi = 1 + Ii-1</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If fraci-1 0, then:</p><p class="depth4">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.114</p><p class="depth4">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.183</p><p class="depth4">If fraci-1 0.50, then fraci-1 will be set equal to 0.50.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> AAF1=1</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In calculating the NCP for year n, the value fraci-1 for i=n will include actual NCP usage through March 31 of model year n-1 and EPA's estimate of additional usage for the remainder of model year n-1 using manufacturer input. All manufacturers using NCPs must report by subclass actual NCP and non-NCP production numbers through March 31, an estimate of NCP and non-NCP production for the remainder of the model year, and the previous year's actual NCP and non-NCP production to EPA no later than April 30 of the model year. If EPA is unable

to obtain similar information from manufacturers not using NCPs, EPA will use projected sales data from the manufacturers' application for certification in computing the total production of the subclass and the fraci-1. The value of fraci-1 will be corrected to reflect actual year-end usage of NCPs and a corrected AAF will be used to establish NCPs in future years. The correction of previous year's AAF will not affect the previous year's penalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The terms in the above formulas have the following meanings and values, which may be determined separately for each subclass and pollutant for which an NCP is offered. The production of Federal and California designated engines or vehicles shall be combined for the purpose of this section in calculating the NCP for each engine or vehicle.

However, where the rulemaking to establish a specific NCP occurs after the rulemaking to establish the standard, EPA may augment the data base used to establish the standard by including the best cost and emission performance data available to EPA during the specific NCP rulemaking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In calculating the NCP, appropriate values of the following predefined terms should be used: CL, S, UL, F, and Ai. For all other terms, unrounded values of at least five figures beyond the decimal point should be used in calculations leading up to

the penalty amount. Any NCP calculated under paragraph (a) of this section will be rounded to the nearest dollar in accordance with ASTM E29-67.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The NCP determined in paragraph (a) of this section is assessed against all those engines or vehicles of the nonconforming configuration or engine family produced at all assembly plants and distributed into commerce--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Since the beginning of the model year in the case of a certification failure described by Sec. 86.1106-87(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Beginning ten days after an SEA failure described by Sec. 86.1106-87 (b) or (c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Following implementation of a production running change described by Sec. 86.1106-87(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The NCP will continue to be assessed during the model year, until such time, if any, that the configuration or engine family is brought into conformance with applicable emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A manufacturer may carry over an NCP from a model year to the next model year.

If a nonconformance penalty has been established, such hearing must be requested within fifteen (15) days or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator after the notification of the nonconformance penalty. If a manufacturer wishes to challenge a compliance level in excess of the upper limit, he must request a hearing within fifteen (15) days or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator after the completion of the Production Compliance Audit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the nonconformance penalty or penalties assessed under this subpart must be paid as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the nonconformance penalty or penalties assessed under this subpart must be paid as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By the quarterly due dates, i.e., within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31), or according to such other payment schedule as the Administrator may approve pursuant to a manufacturer's request, for all nonconforming engines or vehicles produced by a manufacturer in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and distributed into commerce for that quarter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The penalty shall be payable to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, NCP Fund, Motor Vehicle and Engine Compliance Program, P.O.

The engineering and development component will be determined by multiplying the base penalty amount by the engineering and development factor for the appropriate subclass and pollutant in Sec. 86.1105-87. The amount refunded will depend on the model year in which the certification and PCA take place. In cases where payment of penalties have been waived by EPA in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, EPA will refund a portion of the engineering and development component. The proportionate refund to be paid by EPA will be based on the proportion of vehicles or engines of the nonconforming configuration for which NCPs were paid to EPA. The refund is calculated as follows:
Rtot=Dn x FE&D; x NCP1 x Prodtot
RCal=(ProdCal/Prodtot) x (Rtot)
REPA=Rtot-RCal
