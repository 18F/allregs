A written request for an extension, with  accompanying justification and an action plan acceptable to DOE for  achieving compliance in the shortest reasonable time, shall be made to  the cognizant Regional Office Director. Any extension shall be only for  the shortest reasonable time that DOE determines necessary to achieve  compliance. The action plan shall contain a schedule for full compliance  and shall identify and make the most reasonable commitment possible to  provision of the resources necessary for achieving the scheduled  compliance.</p>
