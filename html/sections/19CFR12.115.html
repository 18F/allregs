                            <p class="depth0">If the completed Notice of Arrival so directs, a shipment of pesticides or devices shall be detained at the importer's expense by the port director pending an examination by the Administrator to determine whether the shipment complies with the requirements of the Act. However, a shipment detained for examination may be released to the consignee prior to a determination by the Administrator provided a bond is furnished on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter, for the return of the merchandise to Customs custody. The bond shall be in an amount deemed appropriate by the port director. When a shipment of pesticides or devices is released to the consignee under bond, the shipment shall not be used or otherwise disposed of until the determination is made by the Administrator.
