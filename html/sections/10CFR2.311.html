An appeal to the Commission may also be  taken from an order of an officer designated to rule on information  access issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> These appeals must be made as specified by the provisions of  this section, within 25 days after the service of the order. The appeal  must be initiated by the filing of a notice of appeal and accompanying  supporting brief. Any party who opposes the appeal may file a brief in  opposition to the appeal within 25 days after service of the appeal. The  supporting brief and any answer must conform to the requirements of  Sec. 2.341(c)(3). No other appeals from rulings on requests for hearing  are allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An order denying a petition to intervene, and/or request for  hearing, or a request for access to the information described in  paragraph (a) of this section, is appealable by the requestor/petitioner  on the question as to whether the request and/or petition should have  been granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An order granting a petition to intervene, and/or request for  hearing, or granting a request for access to the information described  in paragraph (a) of this section, is appealable by a party other than  the requestor/petitioner on the question as to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the request for hearing or petition to intervene should  have been wholly denied; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the request for access to the information described in  paragraph (a)(3) of this section should have been denied in whole or in  part. However, such a question with respect to SGI may only be appealed  by the NRC staff, and such a question with respect to SUNSI may be  appealed only by the NRC staff or by a party whose interest independent  of the proceeding would be harmed by the release of the information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An order selecting a hearing procedure may be appealed by any  party on the question as to whether the selection of the particular  hearing procedures was in clear contravention of the criteria set forth  in Sec. 2.310. The appeal must be filed with the Commission no later  than ten (10) days after issuance of the order selecting a hearing  procedure.
