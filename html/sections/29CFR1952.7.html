In Sec. 1902.3(c)(2) of this  chapter this is interpreted as not being applicable to customized  products, or parts not normally available on the open market, or to the  optional parts, or additions to products which are ordinarily available  with such optional parts, or additions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In situations where section 18(c)(2) is considered applicable,  and provision is made for the adoption of product standards, the  requirements of section 18(c)(2), as they relate to undue burden on  interstate commerce, shall be treated as a condition subsequent in light  of the facts and circumstances which may be involved.</p>
