                            <p class="depth0">A. Need for uniformity--Issuing agencies. The Federal government's  need for a uniform set of principles on the question of the use of tests  and other selection procedures has long been recognized. The Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission, the Civil Service Commission, the  Department of Labor, and the Department of Justice jointly have adopted  these uniform guidelines to meet that need, and to apply the same  principles to the Federal Government as are applied to other employers.</p><p class="depth0">B. Purpose of guidelines. These guidelines incorporate a single set  of principles which are designed to assist employers, labor  organizations, employment agencies, and licensing and certification  boards to comply with requirements of Federal law prohibiting employment  practices which discriminate on grounds of race, color, religion, sex,  and national origin. They are designed to provide a framework for  determining the proper use of tests and other selection procedures.  These guidelines do not require a user to conduct validity studies of  selection procedures where no adverse impact results. However, all users  are encouraged to use selection procedures which are valid, especially  users operating under merit principles.</p><p class="depth0">C. Relation to prior guidelines. These guidelines are based upon and  supersede previously issued guidelines on employee selection procedures.  These guidelines have been built upon court decisions, the previously  issued guidelines of the agencies, and the practical experience of the  agencies, as well as the standards of the psychological profession.  These guidelines are intended to be consistent with existing law.</p>
