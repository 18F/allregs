                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Civil penalty--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. In addition to any criminal  penalty provided by law, each U.S. citizen, resident, or person filing a  separate or joint information return or on whose behalf a return is  filed, pursuant to sections 6035, 6046, or 6046A, and the regulations  thereunder, who fails to file such a return within the time provided, or  who files a return which does not show the required information, shall  pay a penalty of $1,000, unless such failure is shown to be due to  reasonable cause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Joint return. The penalty imposed by section 6679 and this  section shall apply to each U.S. citizen, resident, or person filing a  joint return pursuant to the provisions of section 6035, 6046, or 6046A,  which does not show the required information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Showing of reasonable cause. The district director, the director  of the Internal Revenue service center, and the director of  International Operations are authorized to make the determination that  such failure was due to a reasonable cause and that, accordingly, the  penalty imposed by section 6679 shall not apply. An affirmative showing  of reasonable cause must be made in the form of a written statement,  containing a declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury,  setting forth all the facts alleged as a reasonable cause. If the  taxpayer exercises ordinary business care and prudence and is  nevertheless unable to furnish any item of information required under  section 6035, 6046, or 6046A and the regulations thereunder, such  failure shall be considered due to a reasonable cause. In determining  the extent of a taxpayer's ability to obtain information, the percentage  of stock owned by such taxpayer and the nature of the other interests in  the foreign corporation will be considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deficiency procedures not to apply. The penalty imposed by  section 6679 may be assessed and collected without regard to the  deficiency procedures provided by subchapter B of chapter 63 of the  Code.
