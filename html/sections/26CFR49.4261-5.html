                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The tax imposed by section 4261(b) applies to  amounts paid outside the United States for the taxable transportation of  persons, but only if such transportation begins and ends in the United  States. Thus, in addition to the exclusion provided for certain travel  under section 4262(b), the tax imposed by section 4261(b), shall not  apply unless the transportation both begins and ends within the United  States. Accordingly, the tax does not apply to a payment made outside  the United States for one-way or round-trip transportation between a  point within the United States and a point outside the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transportation between two or more points in the United States.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of this section, a payment made outside the United  States for transportation between two or more points in the United  States is a payment for transportation which begins and ends in the  United States, even though additional transportation to or from a point  outside the United States is involved in the entire journey, if at the  time of making payment for the transportation between two or more points  in the United States it is not definitely established, under the rules  set forth in Sec. 49.4261-6, that such transportation is purchased for  use in making the journey from or to a point outside the United States.  The fact that the entire journey includes transportation from or to a  point outside the United States is not in itself determinative of the  liability for tax.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following examples illustrate the application of this  paragraph:</p><p class="depth3">Example (1). W travels from Havana, Cuba to New York by way of  Miami. He purchases in Havana a steamship ticket for his transportation  from Havana to Miami and an exchange order for air transportation from  Miami to New York. The ticket for the connecting transportation from  Havana to Miami, and the order for the transportation from Miami to New  York were not appropriately inscribed by the agency or carrier which  received the payment for the air transportation involved at the time  such payment was received so as to clearly show that the ticket and  order were purchased for use in conjunction with each other. Therefore,  the agency or carrier which accepts the exchange order and issues the  ticket for the transportation from Miami to New York is required to  collect the tax which applies to the amount paid outside the United  States for such transportation.</p><p class="depth3">Example (2). X travels on a round trip from Montreal, Canada, to Los  Angeles by way of New York. He purchases in Montreal air transportation  for the round trip between New York and Los Angeles, and uses a private  automobile for transportation from Montreal to New York and return to  Montreal. The amount paid in Montreal for the round-trip transportation  between New York and Los Angeles is a payment for transportation which  begins and ends in the United States and is therefore subject to tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cross reference. See section 4262(b) and Sec. 49.4262(b)-1 for  a partial exclusion with respect to amounts paid for certain  transportation.</p>
