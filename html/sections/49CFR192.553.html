                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pressure increases. Whenever the requirements of this subpart require that an increase in operating pressure be made in increments, the pressure must be increased gradually, at a rate that can be controlled, and in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At the end of each incremental increase, the pressure must be held constant while the entire segment of pipeline that is affected is checked for leaks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each leak detected must be repaired before a further pressure increase is made, except that a leak determined not to be potentially hazardous need not be repaired, if it is monitored during the pressure increase and it does not become potentially hazardous.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records. Each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline shall retain for the life of the segment a record of each investigation required by this subpart, of all work performed, and of each pressure test conducted, in connection with the uprating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Written plan. Each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline shall establish a written procedure that will ensure that each applicable requirement of this subpart is complied with.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitation on increase in maximum allowable operating pressure. Except as provided in Sec. 192.555(c), a new maximum allowable operating pressure established under this subpart may not exceed the maximum that would be allowed under Secs. 192.619 and 192.621 for a new segment of pipeline constructed of the same materials in the same location. However, when uprating a steel pipeline, if any variable necessary to determine the design pressure under the design formula (Sec. 192.105) is unknown, the MAOP may be increased as provided in Sec. 192.619(a)(1).
