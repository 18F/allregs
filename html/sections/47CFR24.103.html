                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nationwide narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base  stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 750,000 square  kilometers or serve 37.5 percent of the U.S. population within five  years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations  that provide coverage to a composite area of 1,500,000 square kilometers  or serve 75 percent of the U.S. population within ten years of initial  license grant date. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide  substantial service to the licensed area as provided in paragraph (d) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Regional narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations  that provide coverage to a composite area of 150,000 square kilometers  or serve 37.5 percent of the population of the service area within five  years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations  that provide coverage to a composite area of 300,000 square kilometers  or serve 75 percent of the service area population within ten years of  initial license grant date. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide  substantial service to the licensed area as provided in paragraph (d) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> MTA narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations that  provide coverage to a composite area of 75,000 square kilometers or 25  percent of the geographic area, or serve 37.5 percent of the population  of the service area within five years of initial license grant date;  and, shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite  area of 150,000 square kilometers or 50 percent of the geographic area,  or serve 75 percent of the population of the service area within ten  years of initial license grant date. Licensees may, in the alternative,  provide substantial service to the licensed area as provided in  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As an alternative to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b),  and (c) of this section, narrowband PCS licensees may demonstrate that,  no later than ten years after the initial grant of their license, they  provide substantial service to their licensed area. Licensees choosing  this option must notify the FCC by filing FCC Form 601, no later than 15  days after the end of the five year period following the initial grant  of their license, that they plan to satisfy the alternative requirement  to provide substantial service. ``Substantial service'' is defined as  service that is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of  mediocre service that would barely warrant renewal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In demonstrating compliance with the construction requirements  set forth in this section, licensees must base their calculations on  signal field strengths that ensure reliable service for the technology  utilized. Licensees may determine the population of geographic areas  included within their service contours using either the 1990 census or  the 2000 census, but not both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the purpose of this section, the service radius of a base  station may be calculated using the following formula:  dkm = 2.53 x hm0.34 x p\0.17\  where dkm is the radial distance in kilometers, hm is the antenna HAAT of the base station in meters, and p is the e.r.p. of the base station in watts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternatively, licensees may use any service radius contour  formula developed or generally used by industry, provided that such  formula is based on the technical characteristics of their system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Upon meeting the five and ten year benchmarks in paragraphs (a),  (b), and (c) of this section, or upon meeting the substantial service  alternative in paragraph (d), licensees shall notify the Commission by  filing FCC Form 601 and including a map and other supporting  documentation that demonstrate the required geographic area coverage,  population coverage, or substantial service to the licensed area. The  notification must be filed with the Commission within 15 days of the  expiration of the relevant period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the sale of a license is approved, the new licensee is held  to the original build-out requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Failure by a licensee to meet the above construction  requirements shall result in forfeiture of the license and ineligibility  to regain it.  [59 FR 14118, Mar. 25, 1994, as amended at 65 FR 35852, June 6, 2000]</p>
