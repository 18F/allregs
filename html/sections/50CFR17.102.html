A water vehicle is considered on plane when it is being operated at or above the speed necessary to keep the vessel planing;</p><p class="depth0">Slow speed is defined as the speed at which a water vehicle proceeds when it is fully off plane and completely settled in the water. Due to the different speeds at which water vehicles of different sizes and configurations may travel while in compliance with this definition, no specific speed is assigned to slow speed. A water vehicle is not proceeding at slow speed if it is: on a plane; in the process of coming up on or coming off of plane; or creating an excessive wake. A water vehicle is proceeding at slow speed if it is fully off plane and completely settled in the water, not creating an excessive wake;</p><p class="depth0">Slow speed (channel exempt) means that the slow-speed designation does not apply to those waters within the maintained, marked channel;</p><p class="depth0">Slow speed (channel included) means that the slow-speed designation applies both within and outside the designated channel;</p><p class="depth0">Wake means all changes in the vertical height of the water's surface caused by the passage of a water vehicle, including a vessel's bow wave, stern wave, and propeller wash, or a combination thereof;</p><p class="depth0">Waterborne activity includes, but is not limited to, swimming, diving (including skin and scuba diving), snorkeling, water skiing, surfing, fishing, the use of water vehicles, and dredging and filling operations;</p><p class="depth0">Water vehicle, watercraft, and vessel include, but are not limited to, boats (whether powered by engine, wind, or other means), ships (whether powered by engine, wind, or other means), barges, surfboards, personal watercraft, water skis, or any other device or mechanism the primary or an incidental purpose of which is locomotion
