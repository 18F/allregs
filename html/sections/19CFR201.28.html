                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If, upon viewing his or her records, an individual disagrees  with a portion thereof or feels sections thereof to be erroneous, the  individual may request amendment[s] of the records pertaining to him or  her. The individual should request such an amendment in writing and  should identify each particular record in question, the system[s] of  records wherein the records are located, specify the amendment  requested, and specify the reasons why the records are not correct,  relevant timely or complete. The individual may submit any documentation  that would be helpful. The request for amendment of records shall be  addressed to the Privacy Act Officer, United States International Trade  Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436, and shall clearly  indicate both on the envelope and in the letter that it is a Privacy Act  request for amendment of records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Not later than 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal  public holidays) after the date of receipt of a Privacy Act request for  amendment of records, the Privacy Act Officer shall acknowledge such  receipt in writing. Such a request for amendment will be granted or  denied by the Privacy Act Officer or, for records maintained by the  Inspector General. If the request is granted, the Privacy Act Officer,  or the Inspector General for records maintained by the Inspector  General, shall promptly make any correction of any portion of the record  which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or  complete. If, however, the request is denied, the Privacy Act Officer  shall inform the individual of the refusal to amend the record in  accordance with the individual's request and give the reason(s) for the  refusal. In cases where the Privacy Act Officer or the Inspector General  has refused to amend in accordance with an individual's request, he or  she also shall advise the individual of the procedures under Sec.  201.30 of this part for the individual to request a review of that  refusal by the full Commission or by an officer designated by the  Commission.</p>
