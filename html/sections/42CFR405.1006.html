The Secretary will publish changes to the amount in controversy requirement in the Federal Register when necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Judicial review.

Either an individual appellant or multiple appellants may aggregate two or more claims to meet the amount in controversy for an ALJ hearing if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The claims were previously reconsidered by a QIC;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The request for ALJ hearing lists all of the claims to be aggregated and is filed within 60 calendar days after receipt of all of the reconsiderations being appealed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The ALJ determines that the claims that a single appellant seeks to aggregate involve the delivery of similar or related services, or the claims that multiple appellants seek to aggregate involve common issues of law and fact. Part A and Part B claims may be combined to meet the amount in controversy requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Aggregating claims that are escalated from the QIC level to the ALJ level. Either an individual appellant or multiple appellants may aggregate two or more claims to meet the amount in controversy for an ALJ hearing if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The claims were pending before the QIC in conjunction with the same request for reconsideration;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The appellant(s) requests aggregation of the claims to the ALJ level in the same request for escalation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The ALJ determines that the claims that a single appellant seeks to aggregate involve the delivery of similar or related services, or the claims that multiple appellants seek to aggregate involve common issues of law and fact.
