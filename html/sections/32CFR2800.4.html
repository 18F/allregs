                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Staff Security Officer/Top Secret Control Officer. A Vice  Presidential Staff Security Officer and Assistant Staff Security Officer  will be assigned to perform the duties as outlined in these regulations.  They will normally be on the staff of the Assistant to the Vice  President for National Security Affairs. The Staff Security Officer and  Assistant Staff Security Officer will serve as Top Secret Control  Officer and Assistant Top Secret Control Officer and custodians of  classified material for the Office of the Vice President respectively,  and will be responsible for the overall supervision of the Top Secret  Control program. They will maintain positive control over the movement  of all Top Secret material under their jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Custodian, Office of the Assistant to the Vice President for  Congressional Relations. The Assistant to the Vice President for  Congressional Relations, Office of the President of the Senate, will be  designated as Custodian of classified material for that office. He will  be responsible for compliance with the instructions contained herein. In  this capacity, he will be charged with safeguarding classified material  necessary to the operation of the office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> National Security Classifications. Classifications of National  Security Information are defined in Executive Order 12065, sections 1- 102 through 1-104.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prohibited Markings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The caveats ``FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY''  and ``ADMINISTRATIVELY RESTRICTED'' are used within the Office of the  Vice President to designate certain unclassified information which  requires control. These caveats will under no circumstances be applied  to information which qualifies as classified information. Further,  neither they nor other terms will be used in conjunction with the  prescribed security classifications of CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET and TOP  SECRET.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unclassified information bearing either of the foregoing  administrative designations cannot be protected from release under the  national security exemption of the Freedom of Information Act (although  other exemptions may be available).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Security Clearances. No person shall be given access to  classified information or material unless a favorable background  investigation has been   completed determining that the individual is trustworthy and that access  is necessary for the performance of official duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Security Clearance Procedures. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Counsel to the Vice  President will:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Be responsible for the processing of full field investigations  for personnel assigned to the Vice President's staff. Department of  Defense detailees are processed by the Defense Investigative Service.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Inform the Staff Security Office of individuals whose full field  investigations have been satisfactorily completed and approved and of  any subsequent changes.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Notify the Staff Security Office as soon as he/she is aware that  a staff member is planning to terminate his/her employment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Staff Security Office will provide newly cleared persons  with a security orientation briefing covering policy and procedures for  handling classified information and material. After the briefing  individuals will sign a Statement of Understanding of Security  Procedures (Attachment 1). This statement will be kept on file by the  Staff Security Office.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> There is no such thing as an ``Interim Security Clearance''  for persons employed by or detailed to the Office of the Vice President.  Under no circumstances will uncleared persons be given access to  classified material. Access to classified material will be denied until  the individual has had a satisfactorily completed background  investigation, has received the security orientation briefing and signed  the Statement of Understanding of Security Procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Staff Security Office, as part of an individual's departure  debriefing, will remind them of their continuing responsibilities to  protect classified information to which they have had access during the  performance of their official duties. After being debriefed, the  individual will sign a Security Termination Statement acknowledging his  responsibilities (Attachment 2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Satisfactory completion of a background investigation does not  in itself grant an individual access to classified information.  Individual clearances for access to classified information or material  will be controlled by the Staff Security Office and certified in writing  on an individual basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Access to Classified Material. Each member of the staff who has  custody or possession of classified information is responsible for  providing the required degree of protection from unauthorized disclosure  at all times.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Classified information and material will only be disclosed to an  individual after it has been determined that the individual possesses  the required clearance and has a valid ``need to know.'' Persons  releasing the information shall be responsible in every case for  determining the recipient's eligibility for access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Access to Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence Information will  be controlled by the Assistant to the Vice President for National  Security Affairs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Custody and safekeeping of Classified Material. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Classified  material addressed to the Office of the Vice President will normally be  delivered to and receipted for by the Staff Security Office where it  will be entered into the classified material control system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Staff members receiving classified material from any source by  any means will personally deliver such material to the Staff Security  Office for appropriate entry into the classified control system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conversely, members of the staff desiring to transmit  classified material will deliver the material to the Staff Security  Office for handling in accordance with paragraph (h)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Storage of Classified Material. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Classified material will be  stored only in accordance with the provisions of ISOO Directive No. 1,  paragraph IV-F-1 through 4.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Filing of unclassified material in security containers is  prohibited except where the unclassified material is an integral part of  a file which contains classified material. If extenuating circumstances  necessitate the use of a security container for storing only  unclassified material, the container will be marked with a sign stating  ``This container is not used to store   classified material'' or ``Do not store classified material in this  container.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Record of safe locations. The Staff Security Office will assign  numbers to all security containers used to store classified material in  the Office of the Vice President. A record of safe numbers, locations  and date of last combination change will be maintained in the Staff  Security Office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Changing of lock combinations. Combinations of security  containers will be changed by the Staff Security Office or the Secret  Service. This service may be requested by contacting the Staff Security  Office.

Records of combinations shall be  maintained by the Staff Security Office. Whenever a combination is  changed, the new combination and other required information will be  recorded on GSA Optional Form 63. The sealed envelope will then be  delivered to the Staff Security Office for retention in the vault safe.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Custodians. Each container used for storage of classified  material within the Office of the Vice President will have assigned a  primary and alternate custodian. Responsibility for security of these  containers shall rest with those persons, and their names shall be  affixed on the outside of the top drawer of each container positioned so  as to be readily discernible. Optional Form 63 shall be used for this  purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Handling of Classified Material--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of cover sheets. A  separate cover sheet indicating the classification of the material will  be fastened to the top page of cover of each CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET or TOP  SECRET document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unattended documents. Classified material will be under the  direct supervision of a person with an appropriate security clearance  and a verified need-to-know at all times when in use. Special care will  be taken to insure that classified material is not left unsecured or  unattended in an office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Working papers. Working papers are documents, including drafts,  photographs, etc., created to assist in the formulation and preparation  of finished papers. Working papers containing classified information  will be marked with the appropriate classification and provided the same  degree of protection as that given to other documents of an equal  category of classification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Communications security. Classified information shall not be  discussed over any voice communications device except as authorized over  approved secure communications circuits. This restriction also applies  to electrical transmission of classified material via any unsecure  circuitry involving teletypes, DEX equipment or other systems of a like  nature. Appropriate secure facilities for the discussion or transmittal  of classified material may be arranged by contacting the Staff Security  Office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Transmittal of Classified Material--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Outside the Office of  the Vice President and the White House Complex. The Staff Security  Office is responsible for transmitting or transferring all classified  material outside the Office of the Vice President and the White House  Complex in accordance with the provisions of ISOO Directive No. 1,  paragraphs I, G and H.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within the Office of the Vice President and the White House  Complex. Transfer or movement of classified material will be  accomplished only by properly cleared persons handcarrying the material  to the recipient. The material shall be carried in an envelope marked  with the appropriate classification. Use of see through messenger  envelopes is not authorized. Recipients will sign a receipt (GSA  Optional Form 112) for all material classified SECRET and TOP SECRET.  Whenever TOP SECRET material is transferred, the Staff Security Office  will be notified in order to maintain accurate accountability of the  material. Classified material will never be delivered to an uncleared  person, left in an unoccupied office, or sent through unclassified mail  delivery/distribution systems.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Staff members requiring the use of classified material at  conferences or meetings held outside the Washington, DC Metropolitan  area and who intend to use commercial transportation shall provide the  material to the Staff Security Office far enough in advance to assure  that the material will be available   on or before the date needed. This requirement does not apply when  utilizing government/military transportation. In this case, material may  be handcarried. The Staff Security Office will brief each staff member  prior to departure concerning security requirements or arrangements  needed to safeguard the material while away from his office. For  meetings or conferences within the Washington, DC Metropolitan area,  members may handcarry classified material. Use of classified material  during a conference or meeting requires increased awareness and  precautionary handling to avoid security violations and/or compromises.  Staff members using classified material during a meeting or conference  are responsible for ensuring that the material is properly protected at  all times, and that personnel present posses appropriate clearances for  the material being presented.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Visits to foreign countries. Special precautions must be taken  when visiting foreign countries to ensure classified material is  protected at all times. For all visits to foreign countries a member of  the staff will be appointed as custodian for all classified material  required for the success of the mission.

All classified  material originating within the office of the Vice President will be  prepared and marked by properly authorized and cleared personnel in  accordance with ISOO Directive No. 1, paragraphs I, G, and H. A sample  letter is attached for your guidance (Attachment 3). Derivitive  information will be prepared and classified in accordance with ISOO  Directive No. 1, paragraphs II A through C. Questions concerning  procedures should be directed to the Staff Security Office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Reproduction of Classified Material. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reproduction of  classified material will be accomplished only by properly cleared  persons.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reproduction of TOP SECRET material will be accomplished only  by a member of the Staff Security Office or a designated representative  of that office.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Accountability of reproduced classified material will be  maintained by informing the Staff Security Office of the reproduction of  SECRET and TOP SECRET material, the number of copies reproduced and  their disposition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Reproduction machines can retain the imagery of material passed  through them. Therefore, to avoid inadvertent disclosure of classified  information through subsequent use of machines, staff members will  always run machines through four cycles (four blank pages) after the  last page of the classified material has been reproduced. These pages  will be destroyed in the same manner as classified material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Destruction of Classified Material. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> SECRET and TOP SECRET  material will be given to the Staff Security Office for destruction to  insure destruction is properly recorded and destroyed material is  removed from the classified control system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> CONFIDENTIAL material may be destroyed in the holder's office  by tearing lengthwise and placing in a ``Burn Bag'' specifically  designated for classified material.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Classified waste material will be separated from other office  waste material and placed in ``Burn Bags.'' Classified waste material  includes working papers, notes, drafts of classified correspondence,  carbon paper, typewriter ribbons and any other material containing  information requiring destruction. ``Burn Bags'' will be collected daily  by a member of the White House Executive Protective Service who will  then dispose of the bags in a secure facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Typewriter ribbons. Classified material can be reproduced from  imprints on used typewriter ribbons. Therefore, ribbons which are used  in the preparation of classified material must be safeguarded  accordingly, i.e., they will   be stored in a safe at the close of business, destroyed as classified  waste when no longer serviceable, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Inventories. The Staff Security Office will conduct inventories  of all TOP SECRET material charged to the Office of the Vice President  at least annually to determine the adequacy of control procedures and  insure accountability.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Loss or compromise. Any person who has knowledge of loss of  possible compromise of classified information shall promptly report the  circumstances to the Staff Security Office for appropriate action in  accordance with ISOO Directive No. 1, paragraph IV, H.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Penalties. Any individual breach of security may warrant  penalties up to and including the separation of the individual from his  employment or criminal prosecution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Special access. Special access authority is required for release  of Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence Information. The names of  personnel cleared for access to this category of information are on file  in the Staff Security Office.</p>
