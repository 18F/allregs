                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Providing employment services to veterans eligible for a  rehabilitation program under chapter 31. Each veteran, other than one  found in need of a program of independent living services   and assistance, who is otherwise currently eligible for and entitled to  participate in a program of rehabilitation under chapter 31 may receive  employment services. Included are those veterans who:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have completed a program of rehabilitation services under  chapter 31 and been declared rehabilitated to the point of  employability;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have not completed a period of rehabilitation to the point of  employability under chapter 31, but:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have elected to secure employment without completing the period  of rehabilitation to the point of employability; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Are employable; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Have never received services for rehabilitation to the point of  employability under chapter 31 if they:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are employable or employed in a suitable occupation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Have an employment handicap or a serious employment handicap;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Need employment services to secure and/or maintain suitable  employment.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3102)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Veteran previously participated in a VA vocational  rehabilitation program or a similar program under the Rehabilitation Act  of 1973, as amended. A veteran who at some time in the past has  participated in a vocational rehabilitation program under chapter 31 or  a similar program under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, and  is employable is eligible for employment services under the following  conditions even though he or she is ineligible for any other assistance  under chapter 31:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The veteran is employable in a suitable occupation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The veteran has filed a claim for vocational rehabilitation or  employment assistance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The veteran meets the criteria for eligibility described in  Sec. 21.40; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The veteran has an employment handicap or serious employment  handicap; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The veteran:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Completed a vocational rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C.  ch. 31 or participated in such a program for at least 90 days on or  after September 16, 1940; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Completed a vocational rehabilitation program under the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973 after September 26, 1975, or participated in  such a program which included at least 90 days of postsecondary  education or vocational training.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3117)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Veteran never received vocational rehabilitation services from  the Department of Veterans Affairs or under the Rehabilitation Act of  1973. If a veteran is currently ineligible under chapter 31 because he  or she does not have an employment handicap, and has never before  participated in a vocational rehabilitation program under chapter 31 or  under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, no employment assistance may now  be provided to the veteran under chapter 31.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3117)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Duration of period of employment assistance. The periods during  which employment assistance may be provided are not subject to  limitations on periods of eligibility for vocational rehabilitation  provided in Sec. Sec. 21.41 through 21.45 of this part, but entitlement  to such assistance is, as provided in Sec. 21.73 of this part, limited  to 18 total months of assistance.
