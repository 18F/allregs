                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> St. George Island. Federal scientists and Pribilovians  cooperatively manage the subsistence harvest of northern fur seals under  section 119 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1388). The  Federally recognized tribes on the Pribilof Islands have signed  agreements describing a shared interest in the conservation and  management of fur seals and the designation of co-management councils  that meet and address the purposes of the co-management agreements for  representatives from NMFS, St. George and St. Paul tribal governments.  NMFS representatives are responsible for compiling information related  to sources of human-caused mortality and serious injury of marine  mammals. The Pribilovians are responsible for reporting their  subsistence needs and actual level of subsistence take. This information  is used to update stock assessment reports and make determinations under  Sec.  216.72. Pribilovians who take fur seals for subsistence uses  collaborate with NMFS representatives and the respective tribal  representatives to consider best harvest practices under co-management  and to facilitate scientific research.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> St. Paul Island. The Pribilovians who engage in the harvest of  seals are required to cooperate with scientists engaged in fur seal  research on the Pribilof Islands who may need assistance in recording  tag or other data and collecting tissue or other fur seal samples for  research purposes. In addition, Pribilovians who take fur seals for  subsistence uses must, consistent with 5 CFR 1320.7(k)(3), cooperate  with the NMFS representatives on the Pribilof Islands who are  responsible for compiling the following information on a daily basis:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of seals taken each day in the subsistence harvest,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The extent of the utilization of fur seals taken, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other information determined by the Assistant Administrator to  be necessary for determining the subsistence needs of the Pribilovians  or for making determinations under Sec.  215.32(e) of this chapter.
