                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Public entities required by Sec. 37.121 of this subpart to provide complementary paratransit service shall provide the service to the ADA paratransit eligible individuals described in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an individual meets the eligibility criteria of this section with respect to some trips but not others, the individual shall be ADA paratransit eligible only for those trips for which he or she meets the criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Individuals may be ADA paratransit eligible on the basis of a permanent or temporary disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Public entities may provide complementary paratransit service to persons other than ADA paratransit eligible individuals. However, only the cost of service to ADA paratransit eligible

individuals may be considered in a public entity's request for an undue financial burden waiver under Sec. Sec. 37.151-37.155 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following individuals are ADA paratransit eligible:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any individual with a disability who is unable, as the result of a physical or mental impairment (including a vision impairment), and without the assistance of another individual (except the operator of a wheelchair lift or other boarding assistance device), to board, ride, or disembark from any vehicle on the system which is readily accessible to and usable individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any individual with a disability who needs the assistance of a wheelchair lift or other boarding assistance device and is able, with such assistance, to board, ride and disembark from any vehicle which is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities if the individual wants to travel on a route on the system during the hours of operation of the system at a time, or within a reasonable period of such time, when such a vehicle is not being used to provide designated public transportation on the route.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An individual is eligible under this paragraph with respect to travel on an otherwise accessible route on which the boarding or disembarking location which the individual would use is one at which boarding or disembarking from the vehicle is precluded as provided in Sec. 37.167(g) of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An individual using a common wheelchair is eligible under this paragraph if the individual's wheelchair cannot be accommodated on an existing vehicle (e.g., because the vehicle's lift does not meet the standards of part 38 of this title), even if that vehicle is accessible to other individuals with disabilities and their mobility wheelchairs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to rail systems, an individual is eligible under this paragraph if the individual could use an accessible rail system, but--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> There is not yet one accessible car per train on the system; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Key stations have not yet been made accessible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any individual with a disability who has a specific impairment-related condition which prevents such individual from traveling to a boarding location or from a disembarking location on such system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Only a specific impairment-related condition which prevents the individual from traveling to a boarding location or from a disembarking location is a basis for eligibility under this paragraph. A condition which makes traveling to boarding location or from a disembarking location more difficult for a person with a specific impairment-related condition than for an individual who does not have the condition, but does not prevent the travel, is not a basis for eligibility under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Architectural barriers not under the control of the public entity providing fixed route service and environmental barriers (e.g., distance, terrain, weather) do not, standing alone, form a basis for eligibility under this paragraph. The interaction of such barriers with an individual's specific impairment-related condition may form a basis for eligibility under this paragraph, if the effect is to prevent the individual from traveling to a boarding location or from a disembarking location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Individuals accompanying an ADA paratransit eligible individual shall be provided service as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One other individual accompanying the ADA paratransit eligible individual shall be provided service--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the ADA paratransit eligible individual is traveling with a personal care attendant, the entity shall provide service to one other individual in addition to the attendant who is accompanying the eligible individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A family member or friend is regarded as a person accompanying the eligible individual, and not as a personal care attendant, unless the family member or friend registered is acting in the capacity of a personal care attendant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional individuals accompanying the ADA paratransit eligible individual shall be provided service, provided that space is available for

them on the paratransit vehicle carrying the ADA paratransit eligible individual and that transportation of the additional individuals will not result in a denial of service to ADA paratransit eligible individuals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In order to be considered as ``accompanying'' the eligible individual for purposes of this paragraph (f), the other individual(s) shall have the same origin and destination as the eligible individual.</p>
