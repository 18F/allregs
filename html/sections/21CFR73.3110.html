                                Sec. 73.3110  Chlorophyllin-copper complex, oil soluble.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identity. The color additve is chlorophyllin-copper complex, oil  soluble. The chlorophyllin is obtained by extraction from a mixture of  fescue and rye grasses. The chlorophyll is   acid-treated to remove chelated magnesium which is replaced with  hydrogen, which is turn is replaced with copper. This mixture is diluted  to a 5 percent concentration with a mixture of palm oil, peanut oil, and  hydrogenated peanut oil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specifications. The color additive chlorophyllin-copper complex,  oil soluble (5 percent in palm oil, peanut oil, and hydrogenated peanut  oil), shall conform to the following specifications and shall be free  from impurities other than those named to the extent that such other  impurities may be avoided by current good manufacturing practice:  Moisture, not more than 0.5 percent. Nitrogen, not less than 0.2 percent and not more than 0.3 percent. Total copper, not less than 0.2 percent and not more than 0.4 percent. Free copper, not more than 200 parts per million. Lead, not more than 20 parts per million. Arsenic, not more than 5 parts per million. Sulfated ash, not more than 2.5 percent. Total color, not less than 4.5 percent and not more than 5.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Uses and restrictions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The color additive chlorophyllin- copper complex, oil soluble (5 percent in palm oil, peanut oil, and  hydrogenated peanut oil), may be safely used to color  polymethylmethacrylate bone cement. Chlorophyllin-copper complex may be  used at levels that do not exceed 0.003 percent by weight of the bone  cement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Authorization for this use shall not be construed as waiving any  of the requirements of sections 510(k), 515, and 520(g) of the Federal  Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to the polymethylmethacrylate  bone cement in which chlorophyllin-copper complex, oil soluble, is used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Labeling. The label of the color additive shall conform to the  requirements of Sec. 70.25 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Exemption from certification. Certification of this color  additive is not necessary for the protection of the public health, and  therefore the color additive is exempt from the certification  requirements of section 721(c) of the act.  [48 FR 56370, Dec. 21, 1983]    Sec. 73.3110a  Chromium-cobalt-aluminum oxide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> and (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Uses and restrictions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The substance listed in paragraph (a)  of this section may be used as a color additive in contact lenses in  amounts not to exceed the minimum reasonably required to accomplish the  intended coloring effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Authorization for this use shall not be construed as waiving any  of the requirements of sections 510(k), 515, and 520(g) of the Federal  Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) with respect to the contact lens  in which the color additive is used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Labeling. The label of the color additive shall conform to the  requirements of Sec. 70.25 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exemption from certification. Certification of this color  additive is not necessary for the protection of the public health, and  therefore the color additive is exempt from the certification  requirements of section 721(c) of the act.
