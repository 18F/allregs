                                Sec. 60-3.3  Discrimination defined: Relationship between use of selection
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A. Procedure having adverse impact constitutes discrimination unless  justified. The use of any selection procedure which has an adverse  impact on the hiring, promotion, or other employment or membership  opportunities of members of any race, sex, or ethnic group will be  considered to be discriminatory and inconsistent with these guidelines,  unless the procedure has been validated in accordance with these  guidelines, or the provisions of section 6 of this part are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">B. Consideration of suitable alternative selection procedures. Where  two or more selection procedures are available which serve the user's  legitimate interest in efficient and trustworthy workmanship, and which  are substantially equally valid for a given purpose, the user should use  the procedure which has been demonstrated to have the lesser adverse  impact. Accordingly, whenever a validity study is called for by these  guidelines, the user should include, as a part of the validity study, an  investigation of suitable alternative selection procedures and suitable  alternative methods of using the selection procedure which have as  little adverse impact as possible, to determine the appropriateness of  using or validating them in accord with these guidelines. If a user has  made a reasonable effort to   become aware of such alternative procedures and validity has been  demonstrated in accord with these guidelines, the use of the test or  other selection procedure may continue until such time as it should  reasonably be reviewed for currency. Whenever the user is shown an  alternative selection procedure with evidence of less adverse impact and  substantial evidence of validity for the same job in similar  circumstances, the user should investigate it to determine the  appropriateness of using or validating it in accord with these  guidelines. This subsection is not intended to preclude the combination  of procedures into a significantly more valid procedure, if the use of  such a combination has been shown to be in compliance with the  guidelines.</p>
