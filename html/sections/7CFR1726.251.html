                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Where the borrower encounters reluctance among  manufacturers, suppliers, and contractors to bid a firm price on  transmission equipment or generation equipment, materials or  construction, modifications may be made in the RUS standard form of  contracts. These modifications, if applicable, may include, as an  alternative to the standard form, provisions for adjusting a base price  either upward or downward as determined by changes in specified indexes  between the time of the bid and the time the work is performed or  materials are procured by the contractor for such work. A large number  of labor and materials indexes are published monthly by the Bureau of  Labor Statistics (BLS). The borrower (acting through its engineer, if  applicable) will select the indexes for the particular item to be used  in the price adjustment clause. Suppliers'   corporate indexes may not be used. Labor and materials indexes are  reported in the BLS's monthly publications entitled ``Employment and  Earnings'' and ``Producer Prices and Price Indexes.'' These publications  may be ordered through the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government  Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, or any of the BLS regional  offices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Material and equipment contracts. The approved provisions needed  to reflect the modifications to provide for price escalation in the  material or equipment contract forms for generation facilities are as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Insert new paragraphs in the Notice and Instructions to Bidders  as follows:</p><p class="depth3">``Proposals are invited on the basis of firm prices (or prices with  a stated maximum percentage escalation) or on the basis of nonfirm  prices to be adjusted as provided for below or on both bases. The owner  may award the contract on either basis.</p><p class="depth3">Nonfirm prices. The prices are subject to adjustment upward or  downward based on change in the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor and  material indexes.</p><p class="depth3">A proportion of ---- percent [the borrower will enter the  appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to  represent labor cost and shall be adjusted based on changes in the  Bureau of Labor Statistics, Average Hourly Earnings Rate---- [the  borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] from the month in which  the bids are opened to the month in which the labor is incorporated in  the equipment or materials. The adjustment for labor costs shall be  obtained by applying the percentage of increase or decrease in such  index, calculated to the nearest one-tenth of one percent, to the  percentage of the contract prices deemed to represent labor costs. A  portion of ---- percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate  percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent  material costs and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, material index ---- [the borrower will enter the  appropriate BLS index] for the period and in a manner similar to the  labor cost adjustment.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Insert the following in the contract documents under the  ``Proposal'' section:  ``Firm Price $-------- Nonfirm Price $--------''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For equipment that uses a large quantity of insulating oil, the  borrower may insert the following in the contract documents under the  ``Proposal'' section:</p><p class="depth3">``The price for insulating oil shall be adjusted upward or downward  based on the change in the Bureau of Labor Statistics Refined Petroleum  Rate (057) from the month in which the bids are opened to the month in  which the oil is purchased by the equipment supplier. Contracts shall be  evaluated based on an estimated cost of ---- cents per gallon [the  borrower will enter the appropriate cost] for oil. Such adjustment, if  any, shall not change the contract amount for purpose of applying any  other adjustments to the contract prices.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Construction contracts. The approved provisions needed to  reflect the modifications to provide for price escalation in the  construction contract forms for generation facilities are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Insert new paragraphs in the ``Notice and Instructions'' to  Bidders as follows:</p><p class="depth3">``Proposals are invited on the basis of firm prices (or prices with  a stated maximum percentage escalation) or on the basis of nonfirm  prices to be adjusted as provided for below or on both bases. The owner  may award the contract on either basis.</p><p class="depth3">Nonfirm Prices--The prices are subject to adjustment upward or  downward based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor and  material indexes.</p><p class="depth3">A proportion of ---- percent [the borrower will enter the  appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to  represent shop labor costs and shall be adjusted based on changes in the  Bureau of Labor Statistics, Average Hourly Earnings Rate ---- [the  borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] from the month in which  bids are opened to the month in which the work is accomplished. The  adjustment for shop labor costs shall be obtained by applying the  percentage increase or decrease in such index, to the percentage of each  partial payment deemed to represent shop labor costs. A portion of ----  percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of  the contract prices shall be deemed to represent material costs and  shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  Producer Price Index, ---- [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS  index] for the period and in a manner similar to the shop labor costs  adjustment. A portion of ---- percent [the borrower will enter the  appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to  represent field labor costs and   shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  Average Hourly Earnings Rate ---- [the borrower will enter the  appropriate BLS index], for the period and in a manner similar to the  shop labor costs adjustment.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Insert the following in the contract documents under the  ``Proposal'' section:  ``Firm Price $-------- Nonfirm Price $--------''</p>
