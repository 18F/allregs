                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The requirements of this section shall apply only with regard to  WCS license authorizations in Block A in the 698-704 MHz and 728-734 MHz  bands, Block B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-740 MHz bands, Block E in the  722-728 MHz band, and Block C, C1 or C2 in the 746-757 MHz and 776-787  MHz bands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> By the tenth day of the first calendar quarter after the initial  grant of a WCS license authorization subject to the requirements of this  section--and on a quarterly basis thereafter as specified in paragraph  (c) of this section--the licensee holding such authorization must file a  report with the Commission indicating whether, in the previous quarter,  it has taken any outreach efforts to educate consumers about the  transition from analog broadcast television service to digital broadcast  television service (DTV) and, if so, what specific efforts were  undertaken. Thus, for example, if the license authorization is granted  during the April-June quarter of 2008, the licensee must file its first  report by July 10, 2008. Each quarterly report, either paper or  electronic, must be filed with the Commission in Docket Number 07-148.  If the quarterly report is a paper filing, the cover sheet must clearly  state ``Report,'' whereas if the report is filed electronically using  the Commission's Electronic Comment File System (ECFS), the ``Document  Type'' on the cover sheet should indicate ``REPORT.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The reporting requirements under this section cover the  remaining period of the DTV transition. Accordingly, once the licensee  files its quarterly report covering the second quarter of 2009, the  requirements of this section terminate.
