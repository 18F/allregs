                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individuals wishing to request a review of the decision by SSS with regard to any initial request to access or amend a record in accord with the provisions of Secs. 1665.2 and 1665.4, should submit the request for review in writing and, to the extent possible, include the information specified in Sec. 1665.5(b). Individuals desiring assistance in the preparation of their request for review should contact the records manager at the address provided herein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The request for review should contain a brief description of the record involved or in lieu thereof, copies of the correspondence from SSS in which the request to access or to amend was denied and also the reasons why the requester believes that access should be granted or the disputed information amended. The request for review should make reference to the information furnished by the individual in support of his claim and the reasons as required by Secs. 1665.2 and 1665.4 set forth by SSS in its decision denying access or amendment. Appeals filed without a complete statement by the requester setting forth the reasons for review will, of course, be processed. However, in order to make the appellate process as meaningful as possible, the requester's disagreement should be set forth in an understandable manner. In order to avoid the unnecessary retention of personal information, SSS reserves the

right to dispose of the material concerning the request to access or amend a record if no request for review in accord with this section is received by SSS within 180 days of the mailing by SSS of its decision upon an initial request. A request for review received after the 180 day period may, at the discretion of the records manager, be treated as an initial request to access or amend a record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The request for review should be addressed to the Director of Selective Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Director of Selective Service will inform the requester in writing of the decision on the request for review within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal federal holidays) from the date of receipt by SSS of the individual's request for review unless the Director extends the 20 days period for good cause. The extension and the reasons therefor will be sent by SSS to the requester within the initial 20 day period. Such extensions should not be routine and should not normally exceed an additional thirty days. If the decision does not grant in full the request for amendment, the notice of the decision will provide a description of the steps the individual may take to obtain judicial review of such a decision, a statement that the individual may file a concise statement with SSS setting forth the individual's reasons for his disagreement with the decision and the procedures for filing such a statement of disagreement. The Director of Selective Service has the authority to determine the conciseness of the statement, taking into account the scope of the disagreement and the complexity of the issues. Upon the filing of a proper, concise statement by the individual, any subsequent disclosure of the information in dispute will be clearly noted so that the fact that the record is disputed is apparent, a copy of the concise statement furnished and a concise statement by SSS setting forth its reasons for not making the requested changes, if SSS chooses to file such a statement. A notation of a dispute is required to be made only if an individual informs the agency of his disagreement with SSS's determination in accord with Sec. 1665.5(a), (b) and (c). A copy of the individual's statement, and if it chooses, SSS's statement will be sent to any prior transferee of the disputed information who is listed on the accounting required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(c). If the reviewing official determines that the record should be amended in accord with the individual's request, SSS will promptly correct the record, advise the individual, and inform previous recipients if an accounting of the disclosure was made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c). The notification of correction pertains to information actually disclosed.</p>
