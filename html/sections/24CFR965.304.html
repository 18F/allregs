                            <p class="depth0">Within the funds available to a PHA, energy conservation measures  should be accomplished with the shortest pay-back periods funded first.  A PHA may make adjustments to this funding order because of insufficient  funds to accomplish high-cost energy conservation measures (ECM) or  where an ECM with a longer pay-back period can be more efficiently  installed in conjunction with other planned modernization. A PHA may not  install individual utility meters that measure the energy or fuel used  for space heating in dwelling units that need substantial  weatherization, when installation of meters would result in economic  hardship for residents. In these cases, the ECMs related to  weatherization shall be accomplished before the installation of  individual utility meters.</p>
