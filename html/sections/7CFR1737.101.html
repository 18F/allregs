                            <p class="depth0">If the borrower desires to credit amounts spent for preloan  activities against any equity or general funds required by the loan  contract, it shall submit an itemized statement of such expenditures to  the Area Office. These expenditures will be accounted for on RUS Form  503, ``Release of Telephone Loan Funds,'' if RUS determines that the  amounts spent are reasonable based on normal industry practice and that  the procedures set forth in 7 CFR part 1737, subpart D, have been  complied with. Statements of preloan expenditures will be verified as to  accuracy by loan fund audits.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  0572-0085)    Sec.
