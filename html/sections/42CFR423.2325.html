Part D sponsors must provide an applicable discount for applicable drugs submitted by applicable beneficiaries via paper claims, including out-of-network and in-network paper claims, if such claims are payable under the Part D plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Collection of data.

As of 2014, Part D sponsors offering employer group waiver plans must provide applicable discounts to applicable beneficiaries who are employer group waiver plan enrollees as determined consistent with the defined standard benefit.
