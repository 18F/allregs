                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each component of a pipeline must be able to withstand operating  pressures and other anticipated loadings without impairment of its  serviceability with unit stresses equivalent to those allowed for  comparable material in pipe in the same location and kind of service.  However, if design based upon unit stresses is impractical for a  particular component, design may be based upon a pressure rating  established by the manufacturer by pressure testing that component or a  prototype of the component.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The design and installation of pipeline components and  facilities must meet applicable requirements for corrosion control found  in subpart I of this part.
