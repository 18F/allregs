If the coal  extracted or the minerals removed are used by the operator or  transferred to a related entity for use instead of being sold in a bona  fide sale, then the fair market value of the coal or other minerals  shall be calculated at the time of use or transfer and shall be  considered rather than revenue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Persons seeking or that have obtained an exemption from the  requirements of the Act shall comply with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each other mineral upon which an exemption under this part is  based must be a commercially valuable mineral for which a market exists  or which is mined in bona fide anticipation that a market will exist for  the mineral in the reasonably foreseeable future, not to exceed twelve  months from the end of the current period for which cumulative  production is calculated. A legally binding agreement for the future  sale of other minerals is sufficient to demonstrate the above standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If either coal or other minerals are transferred or sold by the  operator to a related entity for its use or sale, the transaction must  be made for legitimate business purposes.</p>
