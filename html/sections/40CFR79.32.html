The Act defines the term ``motor vehicle'' to mean any self-propelled vehicle designed for transporting persons or property on a street or highway. For purposes of this registration, however, gasoline specifically blended and marketed for motorcycles is excluded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All designated motor vehicle gasolines must be registered by September 7, 1976.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In accordance with Sec. Sec. 79.5(a)(2) and 79.11(f), and to the extent such information is known to the fuel manufacturer as a result of testing conducted for reasons other than fuel registration or reporting purposes, the fuel manufacturer shall furnish the data listed below. The highest, lowest, and average values of the listed characteristics/properties are to be reported. For initial registration, data shall be given for any 3-month or longer period prior to the date of submission. For annual reports thereafter, data shall be for the calendar year, except that if the first required annual report covers a period of less than a year, the data may be for such shorter period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hydrocarbon composition (aromatic content, olefin content, saturate content), with the methods of analysis identified;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Polynuclear organic material content, sulfur content, and trace element content, with the methods of analysis identified;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reid vapor pressure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Distillation temperatures (10 percent point, end point);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Research octane number and motor octane number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In accordance with Sec.
