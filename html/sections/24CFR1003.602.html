                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Minimize displacement. Consistent with the other goals and  objectives of this part, grantees shall assure that they have taken all  reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (households,  businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of a project  assisted under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Temporary relocation. The following policies cover residential  tenants who will not be required to move permanently but who must  relocate temporarily for the project. Such tenants must be provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred  in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of  moving to and from the temporarily occupied housing and any increase in  monthly housing costs (e.g., rent/utility costs).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance  written notice of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The location of the suitable, decent, safe and sanitary  dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The terms and conditions under which the tenant may occupy a  suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the building/complex  following completion of the repairs; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Relocation assistance for displaced persons. A displaced person  (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be   provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in  accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance  and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA)(42  U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Optional relocation assistance. Under section 105(a)(11) of the  Act, the grantee may provide relocation payments and other relocation  assistance to persons displaced by a project that is not subject to  paragraph (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide relocation  assistance to persons receiving assistance under paragraph (c) of this  section at levels in excess of those required. For assistance that is  not required by State or tribal law, the grantee shall adopt a written  policy available to the public that describes the relocation assistance  that it has elected to furnish and provides for equal relocation  assistance within each class of displaced persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Real Property acquisition requirements. The acquisition of real  property for an assisted activity is subject to 49 CFR part 24, subpart  B. Whenever the grantee does not have the authority to acquire the real  property through condemnation, it shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before discussing the purchase price, inform the owner:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Of the amount it believes to be the fair market value of the  property. Such amount shall be based upon one or more appraisals  prepared by a qualified appraiser. However, this provision does not  prevent the grantee from accepting a donation or purchasing the real  property at less than its fair market value.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That it will be unable to acquire the property if negotiations  fail to result in an amicable agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Request HUD approval of the proposed acquisition price before  executing a firm commitment to purchase the property. The grantee shall  include with its request a copy of the appraisal(s) and, when  applicable, a justification for any proposed acquisition payment that  exceeds the fair market value of the property. HUD will promptly review  the proposal and inform the grantee of its approval or disapproval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Appeals. A person who disagrees with the grantee's determination  concerning whether the person qualifies as a ``displaced person,'' or  the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible,  may file a written appeal of that determination with the grantee. A  person who is dissatisfied with the grantee's determination on his or  her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination  to the HUD Area ONAP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Responsibility of grantee. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The grantee shall certify that it  will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the  requirements of this section, i.e., provide assurance of compliance as  required by 49 CFR part 24. The grantee shall ensure such compliance  notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the grantee  to comply with these provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible  project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project  costs. However, such assistance may also be paid for with funds  available to the grantee from any other source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The grantee shall maintain records in sufficient detail to  demonstrate compliance with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Definition of displaced person. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of this  section, the term displaced person means any person (household,  business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real  property, or moves his or her personal property from real property,  permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or  acquisition for a project assisted under this part. The term ``displaced  person'' includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the  building/complex permanently after the submission to HUD of an  application for financial assistance that is later approved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any person, including a person who moves before the date  described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, that either HUD or the  grantee determines was displaced as a direct result of acquisition,  rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/ complex   permanently, after the execution of the agreement between the grantee  and HUD, if the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice  offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable,  decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under  reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such  reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated  average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The tenant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility  costs before the agreement; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> 30 percent of gross household income.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate  temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of- pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation,  including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit,  any increased housing costs and incidental expenses; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/ complex after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling  unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if  either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out- of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this  section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced person'' (and is not  eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The person moved into the property after the submission of the  application for financial assistance to HUD, but, before signing a lease  or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its  possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced,  temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the  person would not qualify as a ``displaced person'' or for any assistance  provided under this section as a result of the project;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The grantee determines the person is not displaced as a direct  result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted  project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that  determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A grantee may at any time ask HUD to determine whether a  specific displacement is or would be covered under this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Definition of initiation of negotiations. For purposes of  determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance  to be provided to a person displaced as a direct result of  rehabilitation or demolition of the real property, the term ``initiation  of negotiations'' means the execution of the agreement covering the  rehabilitation or demolition.
