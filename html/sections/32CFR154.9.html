                                Sec. 154.9  Authorized personnel security investigative agencies.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The DIS provides a single centrally directed personnel  security investigative service to conduct personnel security  investigations within the 50 States, District of Columbia, and  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for DoD Components, except as provided for  in DoD Directive 5100.23.\1\ DIS will request the Military Departments  or other appropriate Federal Agencies to   accomplish DoD investigative requirements in other geographic areas  beyond their jurisdiction. No other DoD Component shall conduct  personnel security investigations unless specifically authorized by the  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. In certain instances  provided for below, the DIS shall refer an investigation to other  investigative agencies. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 154.2(c). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subversive affiliations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. In the context of DoD  investigative policy, subversion refers only to such conduct as is  forbidden by the laws of the United States. Specifically, this is  limited to information concerning the activities of individuals or  groups that involve or will involve the violation of Federal law, for  the purpose of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Overthrowing the Government of the United States or the  government of a State;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Substantially impairing for the purpose of influencing U.S.  Government policies or decisions:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The functions of the Government of the United States, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The functions of the government of a State;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Depriving persons of their civil rights under the Constitution  or laws of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Military Department/FBI jurisdiction. Allegations of activities  covered by Sec. 154.7 (a) through (f) are in the exclusive investigative  domain of either the counterintelligence agencies of the Military  Departments or the FBI, depending on the circumstances of the case and  the provisions of the Agreement Governing the Conduct of Defense  Department Counterintelligence Activities in Conjunction with the FBI.  Whenever allegations of this nature are developed, whether before or  after a security clearance has been issued or during the course of a  personnel security investigation conducted by DIS, they shall be  referred immediately to either the FBI or to a military department  counterintelligence agency, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> DIS jurisdiction. Allegations of activities limited to those set  forth in Sec. 154.7 (g) through (j) of this part shall be investigated  by DIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Suitability information--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Most derogatory  information developed through personnel security investigations of DoD  military or civilian personnel is so-called suitability information,  that is, information pertaining to activities or situations covered by  Sec. 154.7 (g) through (q). Almost all unfavorable personnel security  determinations made by DoD authorities are based on derogatory  suitability information, although such information is often used as a  basis for unfavorable administrative actions not of a security nature,  such as action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or removal  from Federal employment under OPM regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pre-clearance investigation. Derogatory suitability information,  except that covered in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, developed  during the course of a personnel security investigation, prior to the  issuance of an individual's personnel security clearance, shall be  investigated by DIS to the extent necessary to confirm or refute its  applicability to Sec. 154.7 (g) through (q).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Postadjudication investigation. Derogatory suitability  allegations, except those covered by paragraph (c)(4) of this section  arising subsequent to clearance requiring investigation to resolve and  to determine the individual's eligibility for continued access to  classified information, reinstatement of clearance/access, or retention  in a sensitive position shall be referred to DIS to conduct a Special  Investigative Inquiry. Reinvestigation of individuals for adjudicative  reconsideration due to the passage of time or evidence of favorable  behavior shall also be referred to DIS for investigation. In such cases,  completion of the appropriate statement of personal history by the  individual constitutes consent to be investigated. Individual consent or  completion of a statement of personal history is not required when  Sec. 154.19(b) applies. Postadjudication investigation of allegations of  a suitability nature required to support other types of unfavorable  personnel security determinations or disciplinary procedures independent  of a personnel security determination shall be handled in accordance  with applicable Component administrative regulations. These latter  categories of allegations lie outside the DoD personnel security program  and are not a   proper investigative function for departmental counterintelligence  organizations, Component personnel security authorities, or DIS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Allegations of criminal activity. Any allegations of conduct of  a nature indicating possible criminal conduct, including any arising  during the course of a personnel security investigation, shall be  referred to the appropriate DoD, military department or civilian  criminal investigative agency. Military department investigative  agencies have primary investigative jurisdiction in cases where there is  probable cause to believe that the alleged conduct will be the basis for  prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Hostage situations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. A hostage situation exists when  a member of an individual's immediate family or such other person to  whom the individual is bound by obligation or affection resides in a  country whose interests are inimical to the interests of the United  States. The rationale underlying this category of investigation is based  on the possibility that an individual in such a situation might be  coerced, influenced, or pressured to act contrary to the best interests  of national security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DIS jurisdiction. In the absence of evidence of any coercion,  influence or pressure, hostage investigations are exclusively a  personnel security matter, rather than counterintelligence, and all such  investigations shall be conducted by DIS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Military Department and/or FBI jurisdiction. Should indications  be developed that hostile intelligence is taking any action specifically  directed against the individual concerned--or should there exist any  other evidence that the individual is actually being coerced,  influenced, or pressured by an element inimical to the interests of  national security--then the case becomes a counterintelligence matter  (outside of investigative jurisdiction of DIS) to be referred to the  appropriate military department or the FBI for investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Overseas personnel security investigations. Personnel security  investigations requiring investigation overseas shall be conducted under  the direction and control of DIS by the appropriate military department  investigative organization. Only postadjudication investigations  involving an overseas subject may be referred by the requester directly  to the military department investigative organization having  investigative responsibility in the overseas area concerned (see  Appendix I) with a copy of the investigative request sent to DIS. In  such cases, the military department investigative agency will complete  the investigation, forward the completed report of investigation  directly to DIS, with a copy to the requester.</p>
