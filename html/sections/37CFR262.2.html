                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this part, the following definitions shall apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Aggregate Tuning Hours means the total hours of programming that the Licensee has transmitted during the

relevant period to all Listeners within the United States from all channels and stations that provide audio programming consisting, in whole or in part, of eligible nonsubscription transmissions or noninteractive digital audio transmissions as part of a new subscription service, less the actual running time of any sound recordings for which the Licensee has obtained direct licenses apart from 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(2) or which do not require a license under United States copyright law. By way of example, if a service transmitted one hour of programming to 10 simultaneous Listeners, the service's Aggregate Tuning Hours would equal 10. If 3 minutes of that hour consisted of transmission of a directly licensed recording, the service's Aggregate Tuning Hours would equal 9 hours and 30 minutes. As an additional example, if one Listener listened to a service for 10 hours (and none of the recordings transmitted during that time was directly licensed), the service's Aggregate Tuning Hours would equal 10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Broadcast Simulcast means</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A simultaneous Internet transmission or retransmission of an over-the-air terrestrial AM or FM radio broadcast, including one with previously broadcast programming substituted for programming for which requisite licenses or clearances to transmit over the Internet have not been obtained and one with substitute advertisements, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An Internet transmission in accordance with 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(2)(C)(iii) of an archived program, which program was previously broadcast over-the-air by a terrestrial AM or FM broadcast radio station, in either case whether such Internet transmission or retransmission is made by the owner and operator of the AM or FM radio station that makes the broadcast or by a third party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Business Establishment Service means a service making transmissions of sound recordings under the limitation on exclusive rights specified by 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(1)(C)(iv).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Copyright Owner is a sound recording copyright owner who is entitled to receive royalty payments made under this part pursuant to the statutory licenses under 17 U.S.C. 112(e) or 114.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Designated Agent is the agent designated by the Librarian of Congress as provided in Sec.  262.4(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Ephemeral Recording is a phonorecord created for the purpose of facilitating a transmission of a public performance of a sound recording under the limitations on exclusive rights specified by 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(1)(C)(iv) or for the purpose of facilitating a transmission of a public performance of a sound recording under a statutory license in accordance with 17 U.S.C. 114(f), and subject to the limitations specified in 17 U.S.C. 112(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Licensee is a person or entity that</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has obtained a compulsory license under 17 U.S.C. 114 and the implementing regulations therefor to make eligible nonsubscription transmissions, or noninteractive digital audio transmissions as part of a new subscription service (as defined in 17 U.S.C. 114(j)(8)), or that has obtained a compulsory license under 17 U.S.C. 112(e) and the implementing regulations therefor to make Ephemeral Recordings for use in facilitating such transmissions, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is a Business Establishment Service that has obtained a compulsory license under 17 U.S.C. 112(e) and the implementing regulations therefor to make Ephemeral Recordings, but not a person or entity that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is exempt from taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has applied in good faith to the Internal Revenue Service for exemption from taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code and has a commercially reasonable expectation that such exemption shall be granted; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is a State or possession or any governmental entity or subordinate thereof, or the United States or District of Columbia, making transmissions for exclusively public purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Listener is a player, receiving device or other point receiving and rendering a transmission of a public performance of a sound recording made by a Licensee, irrespective of the number of individuals present to hear the transmission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Nonsubscription Service means a service making eligible nonsubscription transmissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Performance is each instance in which any portion of a sound recording is publicly performed to a Listener by means of a digital audio transmission or retransmission (e.g., the delivery of any portion of a single track from a compact disc to one Listener) but excluding the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A performance of a sound recording that does not require a license (e.g., the sound recording is not copyrighted);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A performance of a sound recording for which the service has previously obtained a license from the Copyright Owner of such sound recording;
