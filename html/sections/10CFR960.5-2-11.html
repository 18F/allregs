The basis for Table 2 is an upper limit on long term risks of 1,000  health effects over 10,000 years for a repository containing wastes  generated from 100,000 metric tons of heavy metal of reactor   fuel. For releases involving more than one radionuclide, the allowed  release for each radionuclide is reduced to the fraction of its limit  that insures that the overall limit on harm is not exceeded.  Additionally, to provide confidence needed for compliance with the  containment requirements specified above, Sec. 191.14, ``Assurance  Requirements'', specifies the disposal of radioactive waste in  accordance with seven requirements, relating to prompt disposal of  waste; selection and design of disposal systems to keep releases to the  accessible environment as small as reasonably achievable; engineered and  natural barriers; nonreliance on active institutional controls after  closure; passive controls after closure; natural resource areas; and  design of disposal systems to allow future recovery of wastes.</p><p class="depth0">The guidelines will be revised as necessary after the adoption of  final regulations by the EPA.</p><p class="depth0">The implementation of 40 CFR part 191, subpart B is required by 10  CFR 60.112. 10 CFR 60.113 establishes minimum conditions to be met for  engineered components and ground-water flow; specifically: (1)  Containment of radioactive waste within the waste packages will be  substantially complete for a period to be determined by the NRC taking  into account the factors specified in 10 CFR 60.113(b) provided that  such period shall be not less than 300 years nor more than 1,000 years  after permanent closure of the geologic repository; (2) the release rate  of any radionuclide from the engineered barrier system following the  containment period shall not exceed one part in 100,000 per year of the  inventory of that radionuclide calculated to be present at 1,000 years  following permanent closure, or such other fraction of the inventory as  may be approved or specified by the NRC, provided that this requirement  does not apply to any radionuclide which is released at a rate less than  0.1% of the calculated total release rate limit. The calculated total  release rate limit shall be taken to be one part in 100,000 per year of  the inventory of radioactive waste originally emplaced in the  underground facility that remains after 1,000 years of radioactive  decay; and (3) the geologic repository shall be located so that pre- waste-emplacement ground-water travel time along the fastest path of  likely radionuclide travel from the disturbed zone to the accessible  environment shall be at least 1,000 years or such other travel time as  may be approved or specified by the NRC.</p><p class="depth0">The guidelines will be revised as necessary to ensure consistency  with 10 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

The latter are  generally less restrictive than 40 CFR 191, subpart A, but may be  limiting under certain conditions (i.e., if used as a maximum for short  durations rather than annual averages).</p><p class="depth0">The guidelines will be revised as necessary to ensure consistency  with 10 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

The types of  information listed under each guideline are considered to be the most  significant for the evaluation of that guideline. However, the types of  information listed under any particular guideline will be used, as  necessary, for the evaluation of any other guideline. As stated in  Sec. 960.3-1-4-2, the DOE will use technically conservative assumptions  or extrapolations of regional data, where necessary, to supplement this  information. The information specified below will be supplemented with  conceptual models, as appropriate, and analyses of uncertainties in the  data.</p><p class="depth0">Before site-characterization studies and related nongeologic data  gathering activities, the evidence is not expected to provide precise  information, but, rather, to provide a reasonable basis for assessing  the merits or shortcomings of the site against the guidelines of  subparts C and D. Consequently, the types of information described below  should be interpreted so as to accommodate differences among sites and  differences in the information acquired before detailed studies.</p><p class="depth0">The specific information required for the guideline applications set  forth in appendix III of this part is expected to differ from site to  site because of site-specific factors, both with regard to favorable and  potentially adverse conditions and with regard to the sources and  reliability of the information.
