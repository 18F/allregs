                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If, after the charge has been filed, the Regional Director  declines to issue a complaint or, having withdrawn a complaint pursuant  to Sec. 102.18, refuses to reissue it, he shall so advise the parties  in writing, accompanied by a simple statement of the procedural or other  grounds for his action. The person making the charge may obtain a review  of such action by filing the ``Appeal Form'' with the General Counsel in  Washington, DC, and filing a copy of the ``Appeal Form'' with the  Regional Director, within 14 days from the service of the notice of such  refusal to issue or reissue by the Regional Director, except as a  shorter period is provided by Sec. 102.81. If an appeal is taken the  person doing so should notify all other parties of his action, but any  failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the appeal.  The person may also file a statement setting forth the facts and reasons  upon which the appeal is based. If such a statement is timely filed, the  separate ``Appeal Form'' need not be served. A request for extension of  time to file an appeal shall be in writing and be received by the office  of General Counsel, and a copy of such request filed with the Regional  Director, prior to the expiration of the filing period. Copies of the  acknowledgement of the filing of an appeal and of any ruling on a  request for an extension of time for filing the appeal shall be served  on all parties. Consideration of an appeal untimely filed is within the  discretion of the General Counsel upon good cause shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Oral presentation in Washington, DC, of the appeal issues may be  permitted a party on written request made within 4 days after service of  acknowledgment of the filing of an appeal. In the event such request is  granted, the other parties shall be notified and afforded, without  additional request, a like opportunity at another appropriate time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The general counsel may sustain the regional director's refusal  to issue or reissue a complaint, stating the grounds of his affirmance,  or may direct the regional director to take further action; the general  counsel's decision shall be served on all the parties. A motion for  reconsideration of the decision must be filed within 14 days of service  of the decision, except as hereinafter provided, and shall state with  particularity the error requiring reconsideration. A motion for  reconsideration based upon newly discovered evidence which has become  available only since the decision on appeal shall be filed promptly on  discovery of such evidence. Motions for reconsideration of a decision  previously reconsidered will not be entertained, except in unusual  situations where the moving party can establish that new evidence has  been discovered which could not have been discovered by diligent inquiry  prior to the first reconsideration.
