                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Program inspectors may take, without cost to the United States, for laboratory examination, samples of any product which is subject to analysis, from each consignment offered for importation, except that such samples shall not be taken of any product offered for importation under Sec. 327.16.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except for product offered for entry from Canada, the outside containers of all products offered for entry from any foreign country and accompanied with a foreign inspection certificate as required by this part, which, upon reinspection by import inspectors are found not to be adulterated or misbranded and are otherwise eligible for entry into the United States under this part, or the products themselves if not in containers, shall be marked with the official inspection legend prescribed in Sec. 327.26 of this part. Except for Canadian product, all other products so marked, in compliance with this part, shall be entered into the United States, insofar as such entry is regulated under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Product which is inspected and rejected shall be marked ``U.S. Refused Entry'' as shown in Sec. 327.26(c). Such marks shall be applied to the shipping container or the product itself if not in a container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The inspection legend may be placed on containers of product before completion of official import inspection if the containers are being inspected by an import inspector who reports directly to an Import Field Office Supervisor; the product is not required to be held at the establishment pending the receipt of laboratory test results; and a written procedure for controlled stamping, submitted by the import establishment and approved by the Director, Import Inspection Division, is on file at the import inspection facility where the inspection is to be performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The written procedure for controlled pre-stamping should be in the form of a letter and shall include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That stamping under this part will be limited to those lots of product which can be inspected on the day that certificates for the product are examined;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That all product which has been pre-stamped will be stored in the facility where the import inspection will occur;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That inspection marks applied under this part will be removed from any lot of product subsequently refused entry on the day the product is rejected; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That the establishment will maintain a daily stamping log containing the following information for each lot of product: the date of inspection, the country of origin, the foreign establishment number, the product name, the number of units, the shipping container marks, and the MP-410 number covering the product to be inspected. The daily stamping log must be retained by the establishment in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 320.3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An establishment's controlled pre-stamping privilege may be cancelled orally or in writing by the inspector who is supervising its enforcement whenever the inspector finds that the establishment has failed to comply with the provisions of this part or any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. If the cancellation is oral, the decision and the reasons therefor shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose controlled pre-stamping privilege has been cancelled may appeal the decision to the Administrator, in writing, within ten (10) days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the controlled pre-stamping privilege was wrongfully cancelled. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circumstances allow. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. The cancellation of the controlled pre-stamping privilege will be in effect

until there is a final determination of the proceeding.
