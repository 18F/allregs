Except in emergencies where the Secretary  finds that the exigencies require the promulgation of regulations to be  effective immediately, a notice of proposed rule making will be  published in the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 to  afford an opportunity to submit comments and information, at such times  and in such manner as may be specified in the notice. In the event of  the emergency promulgation of regulations, interested persons will be  afforded, as soon as possible, an opportunity to request amendment or  revocation thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any regulations issued pursuant to this section shall contain  provisions for invoking emergency closures or restrictions or the  relaxation thereof at the field level when necessary or appropriate to  meet conditions not foreseeable at the time the regulations were issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Regulations issued pursuant to this Sec. 249.2 may include such  requirements for recording and reporting catch statistics as the  appropriate state fish and game agencies or the   Secretary of the Interior deem necessary for effective fishery  management.</p>
