A ``designated representative'' is any Coast Guard commissioned, warrant or petty officer of the U.S. Coast Guard who has been designated by the Captain of the Port, Sector New York (COTP), to act on his or her behalf. The designated representative may be on an official patrol vessel or may be on shore and will communicate with vessels via VHF-FM radio or loudhailer. In addition, members of the Coast Guard Auxiliary may be present to inform vessel operators of this regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Official Patrol Vessels. Official patrol vessels may consist of any Coast Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, state, or local law enforcement vessels assigned or approved by the COTP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Spectators. All persons and vessels not registered with the event sponsor as participants or official patrol vessels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vessel operators desiring to enter or operate within the regulated areas shall contact the COTP or the designated representative via VHF channel 16 or (718) 354-4353 (Sector New York command center) to obtain permission to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vessels may not transit the regulated areas without the COTP or designated representative approval. Vessels permitted to transit must operate at a no wake speed, in a manner which will not endanger participants or other crafts in the event.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Spectators or other vessels shall not anchor, block, loiter, or impede the transit of event participants or official patrol vessels in the regulated areas during the effective dates and times, or dates and times as modified through the Local Notice to Mariners, unless authorized by COTP or designated representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The COTP or designated representative may control the movement of all vessels in the regulated area.

Failure to comply with a lawful direction may result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The COTP or designated representative may delay or terminate any marine event in this subpart at any time it is deemed necessary to ensure the safety of life or property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For all power boat races listed, vessels not participating in this event, swimmers, and personal watercraft of any nature are prohibited from entering or moving within the regulated area unless authorized by the COTP or designated representative.
