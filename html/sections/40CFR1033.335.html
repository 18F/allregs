                                Sec.  1033.335  Remanufactured locomotives: installation audit
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The section specifies the requirements for certifying  remanufacturers to audit the remanufacture of locomotives covered by  their certificates of conformity for proper components, component  settings and component installations on randomly chosen locomotives in  an engine family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must ensure that all emission related components are  properly installed on the locomotive and are set to the proper  specification as indicated in your instructions. You may submit audits  performed by the owners/operators of the locomotives, provided the  audits are performed in accordance with the provisions of this section.  We may require that you obtain affidavits   for audits performed by owners/operators.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Audit at least five percent of your annual production per model  year per installer or ten per engine family per installer, whichever is  less. You must perform more audits if there are any failures. Randomly  select the locomotives to be audited after the remanufacture is  complete. We may allow you to select locomotives prior to the completion  of the remanufacture, if the preselection would not have the potential  to affect the manner in which the locomotive was remanufactured (e.g.,  where the installer is not aware of the selection prior to the  completion of the remanufacture). Unless we specify otherwise, you are  not required to audit installers that remanufacture fewer than 10  locomotives per year under your certificates (combined for all of your  engine families).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The audit should be completed as soon as is practical after the  remanufacture is complete. In no case may the remanufactured locomotive  accumulate more than 45,000 miles prior to an audit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A locomotive fails if any emission related components are found  to be improperly installed, improperly adjusted or incorrectly used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a remanufactured locomotive fails an audit, then you must  audit two additional locomotives from the next ten remanufactured in  that engine family by that installer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An engine family is determined to have failed an audit, if at  any time during the model year, you determine that the three locomotives  audited are found to have had any improperly installed, improperly  adjusted or incorrectly used components. You must notify us within 2  working days of a determination of an engine family audit failure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Within 45 calendar days of the end of each quarter, the  remanufacturer must send the Designated Compliance Officer a report  which includes the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The location and description of your audit facilities which were  utilized to conduct auditing reported pursuant to this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Total production and sample size for each engine family;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicable standards and/or FELs against which each engine  family was audited;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each audit conducted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the audited locomotive, including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Configuration and engine family identification;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Year, make, build date, and remanufacture date; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Locomotive and engine identification numbers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any other information we request relevant to the determination  whether the new locomotives being remanufactured do in fact conform with  the regulations with respect to which the certificate of conformity was  issued;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each failed locomotive as defined in paragraph (d) of this  section, a description of the remedy as required by Sec.  1033.340(g);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The following signed statement and endorsement by your  authorized representative:</p><p class="depth3">We submit this report under sections 208 and 213 of the Clean Air  Act. Our production-line auditing conformed completely with the  requirements of 40 CFR part 1033. We have not changed production  processes or quality-control procedures for the audited locomotives in a  way that might affect emission controls. All the information in this  report is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge. I know of the  penalties for violating the Clean Air Act and the regulations.
