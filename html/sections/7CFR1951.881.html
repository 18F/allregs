                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> These regulations do not negate contractual arrangements that  were previously made by the HHS, Office of Community Services (OCS), or  the intermediaries operating relending programs that have already been  entered into with ultimate recipients under previous regulations. Pre- existing documents control when in conflict with these regulations. The  loan is governed by terms of existing legal documents of each  intermediary. The RDLF/IRP intermediary is responsible for compliance  with the terms and conditions of the loan agreement. Other than 7 CFR  1951.709(d)(1)(B)(iv), intermediaries receiving an unauthorized loan or  using their revolving fund for unauthorized   purposes will be serviced in accordance with 7 CFR part 1951, subpart O.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each intermediary will be monitored by FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 based on progress reports submitted by  the intermediary, audit findings, disbursement transactions,  visitations, and other contract with the intermediary as necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Loan servicing is intended to be preventive rather than a  curative action. Prompt followup on delinquent accounts and early  recognition of potential problems and pursuing a solution to them are  keys to resolving many problem loan cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Written notices on payments coming due will be prepared and sent  to the intermediary by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 Finance Office approximately 15 days in advance of the due date  of the payments. A copy of the notice will be sent to the FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Administrator or designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the scheduled payment is not made by the intermediary within  30 days after the due date of the payment, the Finance Office will send  a past due notice to the intermediary. The notice will show the late  charge amount, if applicable, and the interest amount past due. The late  charge amount, if applicable, and the interest past due amount will be  capitalized as principal due 30 days after the due date of the monthly  payment unless existing loan documents prior to this regulation state  otherwise. If the loan documents state when late charge amounts or  interest accruals are to be capitalized, the loan documents will  prevail.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A per diem amount will be shown on the late notice sent to the  intermediary. The Finance Office will send this notice to the  Administrator or designee 30 days after the past due notice has been  sent to the intermediary and the account remains delinquent. Thereafter,  further notices by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  designee will be sent to the intermediary on the late payments or any  further payments until the account is in a current status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Finance Office will notify the Administrator or designee on  any payments due from the delinquent intermediary. It will be the  responsibility of the Administrator or designee to follow up on  delinquent payments to bring the account to a current status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A copy of any correspondence or notice generated by the  Administrator or designee on any delinquent loan will be sent to the  Finance Office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Interest will be computed on a 365-day basis unless legal  documents state otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> It is the responsibility of the Finance Office to maintain  complete accounting records for each intermediary. The Finance Office  will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Coordinate with the Administrator or designee to assure that  interest and principal payments received are in accordance with the  promissory notes and its companion documents, and the effective  amortization schedule. If the payments received appear to be incorrect,  the Finance Office will advise the Administrator or designee. The  Administrator or designee will take the necessary action to clear the  issue and promptly advise the Finance Office of the proper accounting  procedure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Send monthly statements to the National Office reflecting all  payments received to date on each borrower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Send to the Administrator or designee a monthly summary of all  intermediary loans as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Number and amount of all loans.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Total advanced on all loans.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Total interest and principal received on the loans.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Total outstanding balance on all loans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Prepare reamortization schedules needed as a result of  restructuring any loans and send to the Administrator or designee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Furnish in writing to the Administrator or designee a per diem  amount on the actual interest amount due when requested by the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> It is the responsibility of the Administrator or designee to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review and analyze the semiannual report of the intermediaries  and reconcile same to the annual audits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Review the annual audits of intermediaries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review the semiannual reports of the intermediaries and take  appropriate action when necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Follow up on delinquent intermediaries to bring the account  current.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notify the Finance Office in writing when a loan is determined  to be uncollectible in order for the Finance Office to make provisions  for an appropriate timely entry to the loss account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Furnish to the Finance Office the necessary information to  produce reamortization schedules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Provide the Finance Office a copy of any correspondence in  regard to the restructuring of the loans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Review reamortization schedules, the schedule will then be  forwarded to the intermediary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Confirm account balances. Payment history of loans and any other  related matter will be furnished to the requesting party, (i.e. third  party auditing firms) if warranted and proper. If there are  discrepancies in any loan balances being confirmed, the Finance Office  should be consulted before the Administrator or designee writes the  requested parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Furnish upon request by the Finance Office, the information  necessary to help reconcile account balances, obtain evidence of  payments made by the borrower, and any other related data necessary to  keep the financial records correct and in balance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Answer Congressional and other correspondence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Review intermediary's plans, cash flow projections, balance  sheets, and operating statements.  [53 FR 30656, Aug. 15, 1988, as amended at 79 FR 31847, June 3, 2014]    Sec. 1951.882  [Reserved]</p>
