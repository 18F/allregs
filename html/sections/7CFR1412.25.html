                                Sec. 1412.25  Reallocation of base acres on a farm and updating
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any or all of the current owners of a farm with base acres of  covered commodities as of September 30, 2013, as adjusted, will have a  one-time opportunity in a reallocation period as announced by FSA to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reallocate the farm's base acres of covered commodities (upland  cotton is not a covered commodity) based on P&CP; and subsequently  planted crop acreage as specified in this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Retain the farm's base acres as of September 30, 2013.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under no circumstances will reallocation of base acres of  covered commodities on a farm as specified in paragraph (a) of this  section result in any increase in total base acres on a farm.  Additionally, if any current owner submits a written conflicting  reallocation request or expresses written disagreement with a  reallocation filed in according to paragraph (a), no reallocations will  be approved for the farm unless all the current owners of the farm  provide CCC with written evidence of the dispute resolution during the  reallocation period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> FSA will provide the farm operator and owners of record with a  summary of all covered commodities P&CP; acres and subsequently planted  crop acreage for the 2009 through 2012 crop years (as reported to FSA on  acreage reports filed with FSA in each of those years). Acreage not  reported to FSA by producers will not be included in the   summary. The summary will reflect the 2014 farm structure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Current owners will be provided a one-time opportunity to update  the records identified in paragraph (c) of this section during the  reallocation period specified in paragraph (a) of this section, provided  that there are crop insurance records (or other verifiable documentation  available to support those requested updates). In the event that an  update to a farm's P&CP; acres of a covered commodity for 2009 through  2012 causes any payment under another FSA or CCC program to become  unearned, the overpayment must be refunded to FSA or CCC in accordance  with the rules for that program and the FSA or CCC regulations governing  overpayment (7 CFR parts 718 and 1403).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> After an update as specified in paragraph (d) of this section,  the owner may redistribute the farm's base acres during the reallocation  period, based on a proration of each covered commodity's P&CP; acres or  subsequently planted crop acreage in crop years 2009 through 2012 to the  total P&CP; acres or subsequently planted crop acreage of all covered  commodities during that time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Upland cotton base acres that were in existence as of September  30, 2013, are considered generic base acres for the purposes of ARC and  PLC. Generic base acres cannot be reallocated to a covered commodity,  but will be eligible for ARC and PLC payments as specified in in this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The summary of records specified in paragraph (c) of this  section is intended to assist current owners of farms with the one-time  opportunity for base acre reallocation as provided in this section. Any  current owner of a farm may also at any time visit the FSA county office  and request to obtain a copy of the summary referenced in paragraph (c)  of this section. Current owners can reallocate base acres at any time  during the reallocation period without receiving or requesting the  summary records, and, therefore, failure to receive a summary record  from FSA is not grounds for appeal or extension of the reallocation  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The option to retain or reallocate base acres is an ``all or  nothing'' decision for the farm. Partial retention of base acres or  partial reallocation of base acres is not permissible. A decision by any  current owner to reallocate base acres on a farm in accordance with this  section is final and binding if made according to this section during  the reallocation period unless that reallocation is withdrawn in writing  by that current owner or another current owner. If another current owner  subsequently files a different reallocation request in whatever time  remains in the stated reallocation period or if there are conflicting  reallocation requests of current owners in the reallocation period, FSA  will deem no reallocation to have been performed unless the conflict is  resolved via written agreement between the current owners who filed the  conflicting requests. In the case of submitting evidence of resolution,  the written agreement must be filed with FSA in the reallocation period.  Any and all updates and reallocation requests mentioned in this section  are subject to review and approval or disapproval by FSA for CCC.  [79 FR 57715, Sept. 26, 2014]</p>
