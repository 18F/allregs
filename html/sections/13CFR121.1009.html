                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time frame for making size determination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After receipt of a  protest or a request for a formal size determination, the SBA Area  Office will issue a formal size determination within 15 business days,  if possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contracting officer may award a contract after receipt of a  protest if the contracting officer determines in writing that an award  must be made to protect the public interest. Notwithstanding such a  determination, the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section apply to  the procurement in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If SBA does not issue its determination within 15 business days  (or request an extension that is granted), the contracting officer may  award the contract if he or she determines in writing that there is an  immediate need to award the contract and that waiting until SBA makes  its determination will be disadvantageous to the Government.  Notwithstanding such a determination, the provisions of paragraph (g) of  this section apply to the procurement in question.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basis for determination. The size determination will be based  primarily on the information supplied by the protestor or the entity  requesting the size determination and that provided by the concern whose  size status is at issue. The determination, however, may also be based  on grounds not raised in the protest or request for size determination.  SBA may use other information and may make requests for additional  information to the protestor, the concern whose size status is at issue  and any alleged affiliates, or other parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Burden of persuasion. The concern whose size is under  consideration has the burden of establishing its small business size.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Weight of evidence. SBA will give greater weight to specific,  signed, factual evidence than to general, unsupported allegations or  opinions. In the case of refusal or failure to furnish requested  information within a required time period, SBA may assume that  disclosure would be contrary to the interests of the party failing to  make disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Formal size determination. The SBA will base its formal size  determination upon the record, including reasonable inferences from the  record, and will state in writing the basis for its findings and  conclusions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notification of determination. SBA will promptly notify the  contracting officer, the protester, and the protested concern. SBA will  send the notification by verifiable means, which may include facsimile,  electronic mail, or overnight delivery service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Results of an SBA Size Determination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A contracting officer  may award a contract to a protested concern after the SBA Area Office  has determined either that the protested concern is an eligible small  business or has dismissed all protests against it. If OHA subsequently  overturns the Area Office's determination or dismissal, the contracting  officer may apply the OHA decision to the procurement in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A contracting officer shall not award a contract to a protested  concern that the Area Office has determined is not an eligible small  business for the procurement in question.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a contracting officer receives such a determination after  contract award, and no OHA appeal has been   filed, the contracting officer shall terminate the award.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a timely OHA appeal is filed after contract award, the  contracting officer must consider whether performance can be suspended  until an appellate decision is rendered.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If OHA affirms the size determination finding the protested  concern ineligible, the contracting officer shall either terminate the  contract or not exercise the next option.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The contracting officer must update the Federal Procurement Data  System and other procurement reporting databases to reflect the final  agency size decision (the formal size determination if no appeal is  filed or the appellate decision).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Once SBA has determined that a concern is other than small for  purposes of a particular procurement, the concern cannot later become  eligible for the procurement by reducing its size.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A concern determined to be other than small under a particular  size standard is ineligible for any procurement or any assistance  authorized by the Small Business Act or the Small Business Investment  Act of 1958 which requires the same or a lower size standard, unless SBA  recertifies the concern to be small pursuant to Sec. 121.1010 or OHA  reverses the adverse size determination. After an adverse size  determination, a concern cannot self-certify as small under the same or  lower size standard unless it is first recertified as small by SBA. If a  concern does so, it may be in violation of criminal laws, including  section 16(d) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d). If the  concern has already certified itself as small on a pending procurement  or on an application for SBA assistance, the concern must immediately  inform the officials responsible for the pending procurement or  requested assistance of the adverse size determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Limited reopening of size determinations. SBA may, in its sole  discretion, reopen a formal size determination to correct an error or  mistake, provided it is within the appeal period and no appeal has been  filed with OHA. Once the agency has issued a final decision (either a  formal size determination that is not timely appealed or an appellate  decision), SBA cannot re-open the size determination.
