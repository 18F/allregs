                            <p class="depth0">In general, sections 1615(d) and (e) of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorize payment from the general fund for the reasonable and necessary costs of vocational rehabilitation (VR) services provided certain disabled or blind individuals who are eligible for supplemental security income (SSI) benefits, special SSI eligibility status, or federally administered State supplementary payments. In this subpart, such benefits, status, or payments are referred to as disability or blindness benefits (see Sec. 416.2203). Subject to the provisions of this subpart, payment may be made for VR services provided an individual during a month(s) for which the individual is eligible for disability or blindness benefits, including the continuation of such benefits under section 1631(a)(6) of the Act, or for which the individual's disability or blindness benefits are suspended (see Sec. 416.2215). Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section describe the cases in which the State VR agencies and alternate participants can be paid for the VR services provided such an individual under this subpart. The purpose of sections 1615(d) and (e) of the Act is to make VR services more readily available to disabled or blind individuals and ensure that savings accrue to the general fund. Payment will be

made for VR services provided on behalf of such an individual in cases where--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The furnishing of the VR services results in the individual's completion of a continuous 9-month period of substantial gainful activity (SGA) as specified in Secs. 416.2210 through 416.2211; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The individual continues to receive disability or blindness benefits, even though his or her disability or blindness has ceased, under section 1631(a)(6) of the Act because of his or her continued participation in an approved VR program which we have determined will increase the likelihood that he or she will not return to the disability or blindness rolls (see Sec. 416.2212).
