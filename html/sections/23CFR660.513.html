In general, where the  agency having jurisdiction does not have established standards, the  design shall conform to American Association of State Highway and  Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards. Should local agencies  desire higher standards than are currently being used for other  comparable highways under similar conditions in the area, they shall  finance the increases in cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Access roads to temporary military establishments or for service  to workers temporarily engaged in construction of defense installations  should be designed to the minimum standards necessary to provide service  for a limited period without intolerable congestion and hazard. As a  guide, widening to more than two lanes generally will not be undertaken  to accommodate anticipated one-way, peak-hour traffic of less than 1,200  vehicles per hour and resurfacing or strengthening of existing pavements  will be held to the minimum type having the structural integrity to  carry traffic for the short period of anticipated use.</p>
