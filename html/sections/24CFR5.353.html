Project owners  shall develop proposed rules to govern the owning or keeping of common  household pets in projects for the elderly or persons with disabilities.  Notice of the proposed pet rules shall be served on each tenant of the  project as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. The notice shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include the text of the proposed rules;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State that tenants or tenant representatives may submit written  comments on the rules; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State that all comments must be submitted to the project owner  no later than 30 days from the effective date of the notice of the  proposed rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The notice may also announce the date, time, and place for a  meeting to discuss the proposed rules (as provided in paragraph (c) of  this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tenant consultation. Tenants or tenant representatives may  submit   written comments on the proposed pet rules to the project owner by the  date specified in the notice of proposed rules. In addition, the owner  may schedule one or more meetings with tenants during the comment period  to discuss the proposed rules. Tenants and tenant representatives may  make oral comments on the proposed rules at these meetings. The project  owner must consider comments made at these meetings only if they are  summarized, reduced to writing, and submitted to the project owner  before the end of the comment period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Development and notice of final pet rules. The project owner  shall develop the final rules after reviewing tenants' written comments  and written summaries of any owner-tenant meetings. The project owner  may meet with tenants and tenant representatives to attempt to resolve  issues raised by the comments. Subject to this subpart C, the content of  the final pet rules, however, is within the sole discretion of the  project owner. The project owner shall serve on each tenant of the  project, a notice of the final pet rules as provided in paragraph (f) of  this section. The notice must include the text of the final pet rules  and must specify the effective date of the final pet rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amendment of pet rules.
