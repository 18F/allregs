                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Act encourages the implementation of programs that have been proven successful. Pursuant to section 403(a)(14) of the Act, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, after a process of consultation coordinated by the Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Justice Programs with the National Institute of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, certifies that the following programs have been proven successful:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> Purpose: Providing community and neighborhood programs that enable citizens and police to undertake initiatives to prevent and control neighborhood crime.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Purpose: Providing community and neighborhood programs that enable citizens and police to undertake initiatives to prevent and control neighborhood crime.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certified program: Community crime prevention. This program aims to prevent crime and reduce the fear of crime through organized collective citizen action. Community crime prevention programs may be initiated by either law enforcement agencies or existing community groups, but each must have the active support and involvement of the

other. Local programs must be designed to meet the needs and problems of specific neighborhoods or communities and particular population groups, including the elderly. They must make extensive use of volunteers. The specific services or activities to be implemented depend on the local situation and crime problem, but usually have, as a core element, neighborhood (block) watch with additional activities optional. Programs to provide training, technical assistance and other support services are also eligible for funding. Program objectives and elements are described in greater detail in the Program Brief on Community Crime Prevention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Critical elements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pre-program planning to determine needs and problems of community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Targeting of activities and services to meet local situation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Maximum use of volunteers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Cooperation of community organizations and law enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Optional activities: Projects must implement one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Neighborhood Watch</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Operation ID</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Security Surveys</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Citizen Patrols</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Escort or Special Services for the Elderly</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Block Homes or Safe-Houses</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Neighborhood Clean-Ups in High Crime Areas</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Public Education</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Training</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Technical Assistance</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Performance indicators:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Number of staff assigned to project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Types of services provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Units of service delivered (e.g., number of block watches organized).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Number of volunteers participating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> Purpose: Disrupting illicit commerce in stolen goods and property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Purpose: Disrupting illicit commerce in stolen goods and property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certified program: Property Crime (STING) Program.

This program is a specific application of the generic planning, implementation, and assessment requirements for effective system development and performance. PMSS uses automated data processing systems to support priority prosecution, improved conviction rates, speedy trial management, and improved efficiency/effectiveness of the prosecutor's office. Model programs result in information systems which support prosecution activities such as identification of violent and career criminals, case and subpoena preparation and witness notification. Systems are used to monitor management decisions and prosecutor actions and to reduce case processing time and case preparation time. Program objectives and elements are described in greater detail in the Program Brief on Prosecution Management Support System.
