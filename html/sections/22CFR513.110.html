                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> These regulations apply to all persons who have participated,  are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate  in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of  these regulations such transactions will be referred to as ``covered  transactions.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Covered transaction. For purposes of these regulations, a  covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier  covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve  the transfer of Federal funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2)  of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement  transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type,  including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships,  contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance,  payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other  nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person.  Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially  designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in  such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Lower tier covered transaction. A lower tier covered  transaction is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a  procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a  primary covered transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any procurement contract for goods or services between a  participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or  exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10  U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary  covered transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any procurement contract for goods or services between a  participant   and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of amount, under  which that person will have a critical influence on or substantive  control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Principal investigators.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Providers of federally-required audit services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. The following transactions are not covered:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier  awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including  deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Direct awards to foreign governments or public international  organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign  governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign  government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities  consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign  governmental entities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without  regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received  in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Federal employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized  emergencies or disasters;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental  operations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Other transactions where the application of these regulations  would be prohibited by law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Relationship to other sections. This section describes the types  of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations  will apply. Subpart B, ``Effect of Action,'' 513.200, ``Debarment or  suspension,'' sets forth the consequences of a debarment or suspension.  Those consequences would obtain only with respect to participants and  principals in the covered transactions and activities described in  513.110(a). Sections 513.325, ``Scope of debarment,'' and 513.420,  ``Scope of suspension,'' govern the extent to which a specific  participant or organizational elements of a participant would be  automatically included within a debarment or suspension action, and the  conditions under which affiliates or persons associated with a  participant may also be brought within the scope of the action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Relationship to Federal procurement activities. In accordance  with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment,  suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion  initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after  August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive  Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation.  Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion  initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be  recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or  suspension under the FAR.  [53 FR 19179, 19204, May 26, 1988, as amended at 60 FR 33041, 33045,  June 26, 1995]</p>
