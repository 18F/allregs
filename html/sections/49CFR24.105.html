                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acquisition of improvements. When acquiring any interest in real  property, the Agency shall offer to acquire at least an equal interest  in all buildings, structures, or other improvements located upon the  real property to be acquired, which it requires to be removed or which  it determines will be adversely affected by the use to which such real  property will be put. This shall include any improvement of a tenant- owner who has the right or obligation to remove the improvement at the  expiration of the lease term.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Improvements considered to be real property. Any building,  structure, or other improvement, which would be considered to be real  property if owned by the owner of the real property on which it is  located, shall be considered to be real property for purposes of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appraisal and Establishment of Just Compensation for a Tenant- Owned Improvement. Just compensation for a tenant-owned improvement is  the amount which the improvement contributes to the fair market value of  the whole property, or its salvage value, whichever is greater. (Salvage  value is defined at Sec. 24.2(a)(23).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special conditions for tenant-owned improvements. No payment  shall be made to a tenant-owner for any real property improvement  unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The tenant-owner, in consideration for the payment, assigns,  transfers, and releases to the Agency all of the tenant-owner's right,  title, and interest in the improvement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner of the real property on which the improvement is  located disclaims all interest in the improvement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The payment does not result in the duplication of any  compensation otherwise authorized by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alternative compensation. Nothing in this subpart shall be  construed to deprive the tenant-owner of any right to reject payment  under this subpart and to obtain payment for such property interests in  accordance with other applicable law.
