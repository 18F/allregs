                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements for production gauges. A proprietor must  gauge all spirits by determining the quantity and proof as soon as  reasonably possible after production is completed. Except as otherwise  provided in this section, a proprietor may determine the quantity by  volume or by weight, by an accurate mass flow meter, or when approved by  the appropriate TTB officer, by other devices or methods that accurately  determine the quantities. If caramel is added to brandy or rum, the  proof of the spirits must be determined after the addition. Spirits in  each receiving tank will be gauged before any reduction in proof and  both before and after each removal of spirits. The gauges must be  recorded in the records required by Sec. 19.585.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tax to be determined on production gauge. If the tax is to be  determined based on the production gauge, all transaction records must  be marked ``Withdrawal on Production Gauge.'' A proprietor may determine  the tax based on the production gauge if the spirits are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Weighed into bulk conveyances or metered using an accurate mass  flow meter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Uniformly filled by weight or an accurate mass flow meter into  metal packages; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Filled by weight or an accurate mass flow meter into packages  for immediate withdrawal from bonded premises with the details recorded  on a package gauge record in accordance with Sec. 19.619.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tax not to be determined on production gauge. If spirits are  drawn from the production system into barrels, drums, or similar  portable containers of the same rated capacity and the containers are  filled to capacity, and the tax is not to be determined on the basis of  the production gauge, the gauge may be made by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Weighing in a tank, converting the weight into proof gallons,  and determining the average content of each container;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Measuring volumetrically, in a calibrated tank, converting the  wine gallons determined into proof gallons, and determining the average  content of each container;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Converting the rated capacity into proof gallons to determine  the average content of each container. Rated capacity will be determined  from specifications of the manufacturer. The proprietor will determine  the rated capacity of used cooperage; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determining by an accurate mass flow meter or a device or method  approved under paragraph (a) of this section, the total quantity filled  into containers, and determining the average content of each container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Records of production gauge. For the production gauge,  fractional proof gallons will be rounded to the nearest one-tenth and  the average content and the number of packages filled will be used in  computing the quantity produced. The actual proof gallons in each  remnant container must be shown. As provided in Sec. 19.618, a separate  gauge record will be prepared for each lot of packages filled (see Sec.  19.485) and for each removal by pipeline or bulk conveyance for deposit  in bond on the same plant premises. The gauge record will show ``Deposit  in storage'' or ``Deposit in processing.'' If spirits are to be   transferred in bond or withdrawn from bond, the production gauge will be  made on the form or record required by this part (accompanied by a  package gauge record, if required).
