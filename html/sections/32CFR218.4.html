                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The following minimum standards for reporting dose estimates shall  be uniformly applied by the Military Services when preparing information  in response to an inquiry by the Veterans Administration, in connection  with a claim for compensation, or by a veteran or his or her  representative. The information shall include all material aspects of  the radiation environment to which the veteran was exposed and shall  include inhaled, ingested, and neutron doses, when applicable. In  determining the veteran's dose, initial neutron, initial gamma, residual  gamma, and internal (inhaled and ingested) alpha, beta, and gamma shall  be considered. However, doses will be reported as gamma dose, neutron  dose, and internal dose. To the extent to which the information is  available, the responses will address the following questions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Can it be documented that the veteran was a test participant? If  so, what tests did he attend and what were the specifics of these tests  (date, time, yield (unless classified) type, location and other relevant  details)?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What unit was the man in? What were the mission and activities  of the units at the test?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To the extent to which the available records indicate, what were  his duties at the test?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Can you corroborate the specific information relevant to the  potential exposure provided by the claimant to the Veterans  Administration and forwarded to the Department of Defense? What is the  impact of these specific activities on the claimant's reconstructed  dose?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Is there any recorded radiation exposure for the individual?  Does this recorded exposure cover the full period of test participation?  What are the uncertainties associated with the recorded film badge dose?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If recorded dosimetry data is unavailable or incomplete, what is  the dose reconstruction for the most probable dose, with error limits,  if available?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Is there evidence of a neutron or internal exposure? What is the  reconstruction?  Upon request, the participant or his or her authorized representative  will be informed of the specific methodologies and assumptions employed  in estimating his or her dose.</p>
