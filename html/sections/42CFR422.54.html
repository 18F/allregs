                                Sec. 422.54  Continuation of enrollment for MA local plans.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. Continuation area means an additional area (outside  the service area) within which the MA organization offering a local plan  furnishes or arranges to furnish services to its continuation-of- enrollment enrollees. Enrollees must reside in a continuation area on a  permanent basis. A continuation area does not expand the service area of  any MA local plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basic rule. An MA organization may offer a continuation of  enrollment option to MA local plan enrollees when they no longer reside  in the service area of a plan and permanently move into the geographic  area designated by the MA organization as a continuation area. The  intent to no longer reside in an area and permanently live in another  area is verified through documentation that establishes residency, such  as a driver's license or voter registration card.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An MA organization that wishes to  offer a continuation of enrollment option must meet the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Obtain CMS's approval of the continuation area, the marketing  materials that describe the option, and the MA organization's assurances  of access to services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Describe the option(s) in the member materials it offers and  make the option available to all MA local plan enrollees residing in the  continuation area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An enrollee who moves out of the service area and into the  geographic area designated as the continuation area has the choice of  continuing enrollment or disenrolling from the MA local plan. The  enrollee must make the choice of continuing enrollment in a manner  specified by CMS. If no choice is made, the enrollee must be disenrolled  from the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Specific requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Continuation of enrollment benefits.  The MA organization must, at a minimum, provide or arrange for the  Medicare-covered benefits as described in Sec. 422.101(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable access. The MA organization must ensure reasonable  access in the continuation area--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Through contracts with providers, or through direct payment of  claims that satisfy the requirements in Sec. 422.100(b)(2), to other  providers who meet the requirement in subpart E of this part; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By ensuring that the access requirements of Sec. 422.112 are  met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reasonable cost sharing. For services furnished in the  continuation area, an enrollee's cost-sharing liability is limited to  the cost-sharing amounts required in the MA local plan's service area  (in which the enrollee no longer resides).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Protection of enrollee rights. An MA organization that offers a  continuation of enrollment option must convey all   enrollee rights conferred under this rule, with the understanding that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The ultimate responsibility for all appeals and grievance  requirements remain with the organization that is receiving payment from  CMS; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Organizations that require enrollees to give advance notice of  intent to use the continuation of enrollment option, must stipulate the  notification process in the marketing materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Capitation payments. CMS's capitation payments to all MA  organizations, for all Medicare enrollees, are based on rates  established on the basis of the enrollee's permanent residence,  regardless of where he or she receives services.
