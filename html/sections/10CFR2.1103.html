This subpart also applies to  proceedings on applications for a license under part 72 of this chapter  to store spent nuclear fuel in an independent spent fuel storage  installation located at the site of a civilian nuclear power reactor.  This subpart shall not apply to the first application for a license or  license amendment to expand the spent fuel storage capacity at a  particular site through the use of a new technology not previously  approved by the Commission for use at any other nuclear power plant.  This subpart shall not apply to proceedings on applications for transfer  of a license issued under part 72 of this chapter. Subpart M of this  part applies to license transfer proceedings.
