                            <p class="depth0">The grant application must include the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An application for federal assistance, Standard Form 424.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An executive summary, not to exceed two pages, describing the  public television station, its service area and   offerings, its current digital transition status, and the proposed  project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evidence of the applicant's eligibility to apply under this  Notice, proving that the applicant is a Public Television Station as  defined in this Part, and that it is required by the FCC to perform the  digital transition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A spreadsheet showing the total project cost, with a breakdown  of items sufficient to enable RUS to determine individual item  eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A coverage contour map showing the digital television coverage  area of the applicant. This map must show the counties (or county)  comprising the core coverage area by shading and by name. Partial  counties included in the applicant's core coverage area must be  identified as partial and must contain an attachment with the  applicant's estimate of the percentage that its coverage contour  comprises the total area of the county (total area is available from  American Factfinder, referenced in Sec. 1740.8 (c)(1)). If the  application is for a translator, the coverage area may be estimated by  the applicant through computer modeling or some other reasonable method,  and this estimate is subject to acceptance by RUS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The applicant's own calculation of its Rurality score, supported  by a worksheet showing the population of its core coverage area, and the  urban and rural populations within the core coverage area. The data  source for the urban and rural components of that population must be  identified. If the application includes computations made by a  consultant or other organization outside the public television station,  the application shall state the details of that collaboration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The applicant's own calculation of its Economic Need score,  supported by a worksheet showing the National School Lunch Program  eligibility levels for all school districts within the core coverage  area and averaging these eligibility percentages. The application must  include a statement from the state or local organization that  administers the NSLP program certifying the school district scores used  in the computations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If applicable, a presentation not to exceed five pages  demonstrating the Critical Need for the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Evidence that the FCC has authorized the initiation of digital  broadcasting at the project sites. In the event that an FCC construction  permit has not been issued for one or more sites, the RUS may include  those sites in the grant, and make advance of funds for that site  conditional upon the submission of a construction permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Compliance with other Federal statutes. The applicant must  provide evidence or certification that it is in compliance with all  applicable Federal statutes and regulations, including, but not limited  to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Executive Order (E.O.) 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity, as  amended by E.O. 11375 and as supplemented by regulations contained in 41  CFR part 60;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Architectural barriers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Flood hazard area precautions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1998 (41 U.S.C. 8101 et. seq.), 2 CFR  part 421;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, Debarment and Suspension, 2  CFR part 180, which is adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 417; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352), 2 CFR part 418.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Environmental impact and historic preservation. The applicant  must provide details of the digital transition's impact on the  environment and historic preservation, and comply with 7 CFR part 1794,  which contains RUS' policies and procedures for implementing a variety  of Federal statutes, regulations, and executive orders generally  pertaining to the protection of the quality of the human environment.  This must be contained in a separate section entitled ``Environmental  Impact of the Digital Transition,'' and must include the Environmental  Questionnaire/Certification, available from RUS, describing the impact  of its digital transition. Submission of the Environmental  Questionnaire/Certification alone does not constitute compliance with 7  CFR part 1794.  [71 FR 3206, Jan. 20, 2006, as amended at 79 FR 76004, Dec. 19, 2014]</p>
