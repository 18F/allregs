Air Force members who persist in noncompliance are subject to  adverse administrative action, including separation for cause under AFI  36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures, and AFI 36-3208,  Administrative Separation of Airmen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Air Force officials will ensure that members do not use  assignments or officially sponsored residence outside the United States  to avoid compliance with valid orders of Federal or state court of  competent jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Noncompliance with a court order may be legally justified when  the individual can adequately demonstrate that the conduct, which is the  subject of the complaint or request, was sanctioned by supplemental  court orders, equally valid court orders of other jurisdictions, good  faith legal efforts to resist the request, or other reasons. HQ USAF/ JAG, HQ AFLSA/JACA, and Air Force legal offices in the jurisdiction  concerned will provide legal support to servicing staff judge advocates  who request assistance in reviewing these issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When Federal, state, or local authorities request delivery of an  Air Force member stationed outside the United States who is convicted of  or charged with a felony or other serious offense or who is sought by  such authorities in connection with the unlawful or contemptuous taking  of a child from the jurisdiction of a court or from the lawful custody  of another person, the member's commander will normally expeditiously  return the member to the United States for delivery to the requesting  authorities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A serious offense is defined as one punishable by confinement  for more than 1 year under the laws of the requesting jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Delivery of the member is not required if the controversy can be  resolved without returning the member to the United States or if the  request for delivery of the member is denied in accordance with this  instruction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Ordinarily, do not return an Air Force member stationed outside  the United States to the United States for delivery to civilian  authorities if the offense is not specified in paragraph (e) of this  section. TJAG may direct return when deemed appropriate under the facts  and circumstances of the particular case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Before taking action under this section, give the member the  opportunity to provide evidence of legal efforts to resist the court  order or process sought to be enforced or otherwise to show legitimate  cause for noncompliance. \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\4\ See footnote in Sec. 884.1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
