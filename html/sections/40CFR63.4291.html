                            <p class="depth0">You must include all regulated materials (as defined in Sec. 63.4371) used in the affected source when determining whether the organic HAP emission rate is equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart. To make this determination, you must use at least one of the compliance options for the subcategory listed in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Web coating and printing. You may apply any one of the compliance options in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of

this section to an individual web coating/printing operation, or to multiple web coating/printing operations in the affected source as a group, or to the entire affected source in the web coating and printing subcategory. You may use different compliance options for different web coating/printing operations or at different times on the same web coating/printing operation. However, you may not use different compliance options at the same time on the same web coating/printing operation. If you switch between compliance options for any web coating/printing operation or group of operations, you must document this switch as required by Sec. 63.4312(c), and you must report it in the next semiannual compliance report required in Sec. 63.4311.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliant material option. Demonstrate that the organic HAP content, as purchased, of each coating and printing material applied in the web coating/printing operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, and that each thinning and cleaning material as purchased contains no organic HAP (as defined in Sec. 63.4371). You must meet all the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.4320, 63.4321, and 63.4322 to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit using this option.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Emission rate without add-on controls option. Demonstrate that, based on the regulated materials applied in the web coating/printing operation(s), the organic HAP emission rate for the web coating/printing operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, calculated as a rolling 12-month average emission rate. You must meet all the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.4330, 63.4331, and 63.4332 to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit using this option.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Emission rate with add-on controls option. Demonstrate that, based on the regulated materials applied in the web coating/printing operation(s) and the organic HAP emissions reductions achieved by emission capture systems and add-on controls, the organic HAP emission rate for the web coating/printing operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, calculated as a rolling 12-month average emission rate. If you use this compliance option, you must also demonstrate that all capture systems and control devices for the web coating/printing operation(s) meet the operating limits required in Sec. 63.4292, except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to Sec. 63.4341(e)(5), and that you meet the work practice standards required in Sec. 63.4293. You must meet all the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.4340 through 63.4342 and 63.4360 through 63.4364 to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards using this option.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Organic HAP overall control efficiency option. Demonstrate that, based on the organic HAP emission capture and add-on control efficiencies achieved, the organic HAP overall control efficiency is greater than or equal to the applicable organic HAP overall control efficiency limit in Table 1 to this subpart. If you use this compliance option, you must also demonstrate that all capture systems and control devices for the web coating/printing operation(s) meet the operating limits required in Sec. 63.4292, except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to Sec. 63.4351(d)(5), and that you meet the work practice standards required in Sec. 63.4293. You must meet all the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.4350 through 63.4352 and 63.4360 through 63.4364 to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards using this option.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Oxidizer outlet organic HAP concentration limit. If you use an oxidizer to control organic HAP emissions, demonstrate that the oxidizer is operated such that the outlet organic HAP concentration is no greater than 20 parts per million by volume (ppmv) on a dry basis, and that the efficiency of the capture system is 100 percent. If you use this compliance option, you must also demonstrate that all capture systems and oxidizers for the web coating/printing operation(s) meet the operating limits required in Sec. 63.4292, and that you meet the work practice standards required in Sec. 63.4293. You must meet all the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.4350

through 63.4352 and 63.4360 through 63.4364 to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards using this option.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Slashing. You must use the compliant material option to demonstrate that the mass fraction of organic HAP in each slashing material as purchased for the slashing operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart. You must meet all the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.4320, 63.4321, and 63.4322 to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dyeing and Finishing. You may apply any one of the compliance options in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section to an individual dyeing/finishing operation, or to multiple dyeing/finishing operations in the affected source as a group, or to the entire affected source in the dyeing and finishing subcategory. You may use different compliance options for different dyeing/finishing operations or at different times on the same dyeing/finishing operation. However, you may not use different compliance options at the same time on the same dyeing/finishing operation. If you switch between compliance options for any dyeing/finishing operation or group of operations, you must document this switch as required by Sec. 63.4312(c), and you must report it in the next semiannual compliance report required in Sec. 63.4311. If you choose to apply the compliance option in paragraph (c)(4) to your dyeing/finishing operations, it must be applied to the entire affected source in the dyeing and finishing subcategory. You may not apply any of the compliance options in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section to any dyeing/finishing operation in the affected source if you use the equivalent emission rate limit in paragraph (c)(4) for your dyeing/finishing affected source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliant material option. Demonstrate that the mass fraction of organic HAP, as purchased, of each dyeing and finishing material applied in the dyeing/finishing operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart.

You must meet all the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.4330, 63.4331, and 63.4332 to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit(s) using this option.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Emission rate with add-on controls option. Demonstrate that, based on the dyeing and finishing materials applied in the dyeing/finishing operation(s) and the organic HAP emissions reductions achieved by emission capture systems and add-on controls, the organic HAP emission rate for the dyeing/finishing operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, calculated as a rolling 12-month average emission rate.
