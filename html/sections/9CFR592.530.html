                            <p class="depth0">When an official plant requires inspection service on a holiday or a  day designated in lieu of a holiday, such service is considered holiday  work. The official plant must, in advance of such holiday work, request  that the inspector in charge furnish inspection services during such  period and must pay the Agency for such holiday work at the hourly rate.  For each calendar year, FSIS will calculate the holiday rate for  inspection service, per hour per program employee, using the following  formula: The quotient of dividing the Office of Field Operations plus  Office of International Affairs inspection program personnel's previous  fiscal year's regular direct pay by previous fiscal year's regular  hours, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of  cost of living increase, multiplied by 2, plus the benefits rate, plus  the travel and operating rate, plus the overhead rate, plus the  allowance for bad debt rate. FSIS calculates the benefits rate, the  travel and operating rate, the overhead rate, and the allowance for bad  debt using the formulas set forth in Sec. 592.510(b), and the cost of  living increases and percentage of inflation factors set forth in Sec.  592.510(c).
