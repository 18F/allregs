                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Information returns for an acquisition of control or a substantial change in capital structure--(1) General rule.

For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(iv), the provisions in Sec. 1.6049-5(c) (regarding rules applicable to documentation of foreign status and definition of U.S. payor and non-U.S. payor) shall apply. The provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1 shall apply by using the terms ``corporation'' and ``shareholder'' in place of the terms ``withholding agent'' and ``payee'' and without regard to the fact that the provisions apply only to amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code. The provisions of Sec. 1.6049-5(d) shall apply by using the terms ``corporation'' and ``shareholder'' in place of the terms ``payor'' and ``payee''. Nothing in this paragraph (b)(5)(iv) shall be construed to relieve a corporation of its withholding obligations under section 1441.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any shareholder if, on January 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the shareholder receives cash, stock, or other property, the corporation did not know and did not have reason to know that the shareholder received such cash, stock, or other property in a transaction or series of related transactions that would result in an acquisition of control or a substantial change in capital structure within the meaning of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Coordination with other sections. In general, no reporting is required under this paragraph (b) with respect to amounts that are required to be reported under sections 6042 or 6045, unless the corporation knows or has reason to know that such amounts are not properly reported in accordance with those sections. A corporation must satisfy the requirements under this paragraph (b) with respect to any shareholder of record that is a clearing organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acquisition of control of a corporation--(1) In general. For purposes of this section, an acquisition of control of a corporation (first corporation) occurs if, in a transaction or series of related transactions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of this section, an acquisition of control of a corporation (first corporation) occurs if, in a transaction or series of related transactions--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before an acquisition of stock of the first corporation (directly or indirectly) by a second corporation, the second corporation does not have control of the first corporation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After the acquisition, the second corporation has control of the first corporation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The fair market value of the stock acquired in the transaction and in any related transactions as of the date or dates on which such stock was acquired is $100 million or more;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The shareholders of the first corporation receive stock or other property pursuant to the acquisition; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The first corporation or any shareholder of the first corporation is required to recognize gain (if any) under section 367(a) and the regulations, as a result of the transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Control. For purposes of this section, control is determined in accordance with the first sentence of section 304(c)(1). For these purposes the rules of section 318 as modified by the rules of section 958(b) shall apply in determining the ownership of stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Substantial change in capital structure of a corporation--(1) In general. A corporation has a substantial change in capital structure if it has a change in capital structure (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) and the amount of any cash and the fair market value of any property (including stock) provided to the shareholders of such corporation pursuant to the change in capital structure, as of the date or dates on which the cash or other property is provided, is $100 million or more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A corporation has a substantial change in capital structure if it has a change in capital structure (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) and the amount of any cash and the fair market value of any property (including stock) provided to the shareholders of such corporation pursuant to the change in capital structure, as of the date or dates on which the cash or other property is provided, is $100 million or more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Change in capital structure. For purposes of this section, a corporation has a change in capital structure if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The corporation in a transaction or series of transactions--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Merges, consolidates or otherwise combines with another corporation or

transfers all or substantially all of its assets to one or more corporations;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Transfers all or part of its assets to another corporation in a title 11 or similar case and, in pursuance of the plan, distributes stock or securities of that corporation; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Changes its identity, form or place of organization; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The corporation or any shareholder is required to recognize gain (if any) under section 367(a) and the regulations, as a result of the transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reporting by successor entity. If a corporation (transferor) transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another entity (transferee) in a transaction that constitutes a substantial change in the capital structure of transferor, transferor must satisfy the reporting obligations in paragraph (a) and (b) of this section. If transferor does not satisfy one or both of those reporting obligations, then transferee must do so. If neither transferor nor transferee satisfies the reporting obligations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, then transferor and transferee shall be jointly and severally liable for any applicable penalties (see paragraph (g) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Receipt of property. For purposes of this section, a shareholder is treated as receiving property (or as having property provided to it) pursuant to an acquisition of control or a substantial change in capital structure if a liability of the shareholder is assumed in the transaction and, as a result of the transaction, an amount is realized by the shareholder from the sale or exchange of stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Penalties for failure to file. For penalties for failure to file as required under this section, see section 6652(l). The information returns required to be filed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be treated as one return for purposes of section 6652(l) and, accordingly, the penalty shall not exceed $500 for each day the failure continues (up to a maximum of $100,000) with respect to any acquisition of control or any substantial change in capital structure. Failure to file as required under this section also includes the failure to satisfy the requirement to file on magnetic media as required by section 6011(e) and Sec. 1.6011-2. In addition, criminal penalties under sections 7203, 7206 and 7207 may apply in appropriate cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of the rules of this section. For purposes of these examples, assume the transaction is not reported under sections 6042, 6043(a), or 6045, unless otherwise specified, and assume that the fair market value of the consideration provided to the shareholders exceeds $100 million. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. The shareholders of X, a domestic corporation and parent of an affiliated group, exchange their X stock for stock in Y, a foreign corporation, pursuant to sections 351 and 354. After the transaction, Y owns all the outstanding X stock. Assume that, under section 367(a) and the regulations, the X shareholders must recognize gain (if any) on the exchange of their stock. Because the transaction results in an acquisition of control of X, X must comply with the rules in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. X must file Form 8806 reporting the transaction. X must also file a Form 1099-CAP with respect to each shareholder who is not an exempt recipient showing the fair market value of the Y stock received by that shareholder, and X must furnish a copy of the Form 1099-CAP to that shareholder. If X elects on the Form 8806 to permit the IRS to publish information regarding the transaction, X is not required to file or furnish Forms 1099-CAP with respect to shareholders that are clearing organizations.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except X hires a transfer agent to effectuate the exchange. The transfer agent is treated as a broker under section 6045 and is required to report the fair market value of the Y stock received by X's shareholders under Sec. 1.6045-3. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, X is not required to file information returns under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a shareholder of record, unless X knows or has reason to know that the transfer agent does not satisfy its information reporting obligation under Sec. 1.6045-3 with respect to that shareholder. Thus, if the transfer agent satisfies its information reporting requirements under Sec. 1.6045-3 with respect to shareholder I, an individual who receives X stock, X is not required to file a Form 1099-CAP with respect to I. Conversely, if the transfer agent does not have an information reporting obligation under Sec. 1.6045-3 with respect to one of X's shareholders of record (for example, a clearing organization that is an exempt recipient under Sec. 1.6045-3(b)(2)), or if X knows or has reason to know that the transfer agent has

not satisfied its information reporting requirement with respect to a shareholder, then X must provide a Form 1099-CAP to that shareholder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to transactions occurring after December 5, 2005. The amendments to paragraph (b)(4) are effective for any Form 1099-CAP required to be furnished after December 31, 2014. For any Form 1099-CAP required to be furnished before January 1, 2015, Sec. 1.6043-4(b) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2013) shall apply.
