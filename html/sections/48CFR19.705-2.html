If the action includes options  or similar provisions, include their value in determining whether the  threshold is met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determine whether subcontracting possibilities exist by  considering relevant factors such as--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether firms engaged in the business of furnishing the types of  items to be acquired customarily contract for performance of part of the  work or maintain sufficient in-house capability to perform the work;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether there are likely to be product prequalification  requirements; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If it is determined that there are no subcontracting  possibilities, the determination must be approved at a level above the  contracting officer and placed in the contract file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In solicitations for negotiated acquisitions, the contracting  officer may require the submission of subcontracting plans with initial  offers, or at any other time prior to award. In determining when  subcontracting plans should be required, as well as when and with whom  plans should be negotiated, the contracting officer must consider the  integrity of the competitive process, the goal of affording maximum  practicable opportunity for small business, veteran-owned small  business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small  business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business  concerns to participate, and the burden placed on offerors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A contract may have no more than one plan. When a modification  meets the criteria in 19.702 for a plan, or an option is exercised, the  goals associated with the modification or option shall be added to those  in the existing subcontract plan.
