An agency may initiate  disciplinary or corrective action against an employee who violates any  provision of this part, which may be in addition to any civil penalty  prescribed by law. When an employee engages in conduct in good faith  reliance upon an advisory opinion issued under Sec. 2636.103 of this  subpart, an agency may not initiate disciplinary or corrective action  for violation of this part. Disciplinary action includes reprimand,  suspension, demotion and removal. Corrective action includes any action  necessary to remedy a past violation or prevent a continuing violation  of this part, including but not limited to restitution or termination of  an activity. It is the responsibility of the employing agency to  initiate disciplinary or corrective action in appropriate cases.  However, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics may order  corrective action or recommend disciplinary action under the procedures  at part 2638 of this subchapter. The imposition of disciplinary action  is at the discretion of the employing agency.
