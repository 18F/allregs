The tax on a taxpayer's use of a highway vehicle for a taxable period is determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The tax on a taxpayer's use of a highway vehicle for a taxable period is determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The vehicle is destroyed or stolen before the first day of the last month in the taxable period and is not later used by the taxpayer during the period; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The taxpayer sells the vehicle before the first day of the last month in the taxable period and does not later use the vehicle during the period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Computation of tax. If the tax on a taxpayer's use of a highway vehicle for a taxable period is determined under this paragraph (c)(4)(ii), the tax is computed by multiplying the amount of tax that would be due for a full taxable period, as computed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, by a fraction. The fraction has as its numerator the number of months in the period from the first day of the month in the period in which the first taxable use of the highway motor vehicle occurs to and including the last day of the month in which the highway motor vehicle was sold, destroyed, or stolen, and as its denominator the number of months in the entire taxable period. (See paragraph (d) Example (3)(i) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Overpayment. If a taxpayer's liability for the tax on the use of a highway vehicle for a taxable period is determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, any tax the taxpayer paid under section 4481(a) on the use of the vehicle for such period in excess of the tax calculated under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section is an overpayment of tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Definition of destroyed vehicle. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4), a highway motor vehicle is destroyed if the vehicle is damaged due to an accident or other casualty to such an extent that it is not economical to rebuild.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Form and content of claim. A claim for refund of an overpayment described in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section must be made

on Form 8849, ``Claim for Refund of Excise Taxes'' (or such other form as the Commissioner may designate) in accordance with the instructions for that form. A claim for a credit must be made on Form 2290, ``Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax Return'' (or such other form as the Commissioner may designate) in accordance with the instructions for that form. A claim for refund or credit for any vehicle must include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The vehicle identification number and taxable gross weight of the vehicle;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date of the sale, destruction, or theft of the vehicle; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the vehicle was sold, the name and address of the purchaser of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Tax on buyer's use of second-hand vehicles. If a vehicle is sold during the taxable period and a credit or refund of the tax imposed by section 4481 is allowable upon the sale under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, tax is imposed on the use of the vehicle after the sale and before the end of the taxable period. (See paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section for the rules regarding the computation of tax after the sale and before the end of the taxable period.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Computation of tax on second-hand vehicles. The tax under paragraph (c)(4)(vi) of this section on the use of a vehicle after a sale upon which a credit or refund is allowable is computed by multiplying the amount of tax that would be due for a full taxable period as computed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by a fraction. The fraction has as its numerator the number of months in the period from the first day of the month in which the first taxable use of the vehicle after the sale occurs (the first day of the month after such month if the first taxable use after the sale occurs in the month of the sale) through the end of the taxable period, and as its denominator the number of months in the entire taxable period. (See paragraph (d) Example (3)(ii) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Decrease in taxable gross weight, discontinued use, or converted use. The computation of the tax is not affected, and no right to a credit or refund of any tax paid under section 4481 arises, if in any taxable period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxable gross weight of a highway motor vehicle is decreased;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The use of a highway motor vehicle is discontinued (for reasons other than sale, destruction, or theft as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The highway motor vehicle is converted to a use that is exempt from the tax imposed by section 4481(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The application of Sec. Sec. 41.4481-1, 41.4481-2, and 41.4482(c)-1(c) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In July, X uses a vehicle that is registered in X's name and has a taxable gross weight of 70,000 pounds. The vehicle is not a logging vehicle. X pays the $430 of tax imposed by section 4481 for the taxable period. On September 2 of the same calendar year, X sells the vehicle to Y. X's tax is calculated under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) by multiplying the amount of tax that would be due for a full taxable period by a fraction that has as its numerator the number of months in the period from the first day of the month in which X's first taxable use of the highway motor vehicle occurs to and including the last day of the month in which the vehicle was sold, and as its denominator the number of months in the entire taxable period. Thus, X's tax for the period is $107.50 (3/12 of $430), and X may claim a credit or refund of $322.50 ($430.00-$107.50) in accordance with Sec. 41.4481-1(c)(4)(v) after X sells the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On September 23, Y uses the vehicle. Y is liable for tax on the use of the vehicle during the taxable period ending June 30 of the following calendar year. Y's tax is calculated under paragraph (c)(4)(vii) by multiplying the amount of tax that would be due for a full taxable period by a fraction that has as its numerator the number of months in the period from the first day of the month in which Y's first taxable use of the vehicle after the sale occurs (the first day of the month after such month if the first taxable use after the sale occurs in the month of the sale) through the end of the taxable period, and as its denominator the number of months in the entire taxable period. Y's first use of the vehicle occurs in the month of the sale. Accordingly, Y's tax is based on the number of months in the period from the first day of October (the month following the month of the first taxable use) through the end of June, and Y owes a section 4481 tax of $322.50 (9/12 of $430) for the taxable period.</p><p class="depth0">Example (4). Assume the same facts as in Example (3)(i), except that on September 2, X sells the vehicle to Dealer, a dealer in highway motor vehicles. X may claim a credit or refund of $322.50. Dealer operates the vehicle exclusively for the purpose of demonstration, which is not a ``use'' of the vehicle under Sec. 41.4482(c)-1(c). On May 2 of the following calendar year, Dealer sells the vehicle to Y. Dealer does not owe a section 4481 tax and may not claim a refund. Y's first taxable use of the vehicle occurs on May 3. Y's first taxable use of the vehicle does not occur in the month of a sale upon which a credit or refund is allowable. Accordingly, Y's tax is calculated under paragraph (c)(2) by multiplying the amount of tax that would be due for a full taxable period by a fraction which has as its numerator the number of months in the taxable period beginning with the month of first taxable use and as its denominator the number of months in the entire taxable period. The numerator is the number of months in the period from the first day of May (the month of Y's first taxable use after

the sale) through the end of June, and Y owes a section 4481 tax of $71.67 (2/12 of $430) for the taxable period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies on and after July 1, 2015. For rules applicable before that date, see 26 CFR 41.4481-1 (revised as of April 1, 2014).</p>
