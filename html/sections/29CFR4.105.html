Accordingly, the minimum wage protection of the  Act now extends to all workers, both blue collar and white collar, other  than persons employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or  professional capacity as those terms are used in the Fair Labor  Standards Act and in part 541 of title 29. Public Law 94-489  accomplished this change by adding to section 2(a)(5) of the Act a  reference to 5 U.S.C. 5332, which deals with white collar workers, and  by amending the definition of service contract employee in section 8(b)  of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Included in this part 4 and in parts 6 and 8 of this subtitle  are provisions to give effect to the amendments mentioned in this  section.
