                            <p class="depth0">The Secretary of National Defense of the Republic of the Philippines shall make determinations as to whether any patient should be admitted in emergency circumstances before the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has made a legal determination of eligibility, except that liability for payment will not accrue to the United States until such eligibility determination has been made. Eligibility determinations will be given effect retroactively to the date of admission when the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has been notified by telephone, telegram, letter, or other communication of the emergency admission within 72 hours of the hour of admission. The Clinic Director of the VA Regional Office, Manila, may make an exception to the 72-hour limitation when it is determined that the delay in notification was fully justified. When any authorization cannot be made effective retroactively to the date of admission, it shall be effective from the date of receipt of notification.
