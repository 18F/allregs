(1) Courses not leading to a standard college degree may be measured on either a clock-hour basis, or a credit-hour basis or a combination of both. Factors which the Department of Veterans Affairs must include in determining the proper basis for measurement include whether the courses are accredited; whether the course could be credited toward a standard college degree; and whether the course is offered on a standard quarter or semester-hour basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Courses not leading to a standard college degree may be measured on either a clock-hour basis, or a credit-hour basis or a combination of both. Factors which the Department of Veterans Affairs must include in determining the proper basis for measurement include whether the courses are accredited; whether the course could be credited toward a standard college degree; and whether the course is offered on a standard quarter or semester-hour basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining which is the correct basis for measuring a reservist's enrollment, VA will first examine whether credit-hour measurement is appropriate, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If it is not appropriate to measure a reservist's enrollment on a credit-hour basis, VA will measure the enrollment on a clock-hour basis as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

If the educational institution does not require at least the same number of clock-hours of attendance as required in paragraph (c) of this section, VA will not apply the provisions of Sec. 21.7670, but will measure the course according to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> VA will apply the provisions of Sec. 21.4272(g) to new enrollments beginning on or after July 1, 1993, if one or more of the reservist's courses are offered during a nonstandard term.

The provisions of this paragraph apply to all enrollments in courses not leading to a standard college degree. If VA concludes that the courses in which a reservist is enrolled do not qualify for credit-hour measurement, VA shall measure those courses as follows. (Supervised study shall be excluded from measurement of all courses to which this paragraph applies).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If shop practice is an integral part of the course--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Full-time training shall be 22 clock hours attendance with not more than 2\1/2\ hours rest period allowance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Three-quarter-time training shall be 16 through 21 clock hours attendance with not more than 2 hours rest period allowance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Half-time training shall be 11 through 15 clock hours attendance with not more than 1\1/4\ hours rest period allowance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> One-quarter-time training shall be 1 through 10 clock hours attendance. For attendance of 6 through 10 clock hours, there shall be not more than one quarter hour rest period allowance. For attendance of 1 through 5 clock hours, there shall be no rest period allowance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If theory and class instruction predominates--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Full-time training is 18 clock hours net instruction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Three-quarter-time training is 13 through 17 clock hours net instruction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Half-time training is 9 through 12 clock hours net instruction; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Less than half-time training is 1 through 8 clock hours net instruction. In measuring net instruction for this paragraph there will be included customary intervals not to exceed 10 minutes between classes: however, supervised study must be excluded.
