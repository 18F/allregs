                            <p class="depth0">When one of the following exceptions applies, the contracting  officer may acquire a foreign end product without regard to the  restrictions of the Buy American statute:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Public interest. The head of the agency may make a determination  that domestic preference would be inconsistent with the public interest.  This exception applies when an agency has an agreement with a foreign  government that provides a blanket exception to the Buy American  statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nonavailability. The Buy American statute does not apply with  respect to articles, materials, or supplies if articles, materials, or  supplies of the class or kind to be acquired, either as end items or  components, are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United  States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and  of a satisfactory quality.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Class determinations. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A nonavailability determination has  been made for the articles listed in 25.104. This determination does not  necessarily mean that there is no domestic   source for the listed items, but that domestic sources can only meet 50  percent or less of total U.S. Government and nongovernment demand.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Before acquisition of an article on the list, the procuring  agency is responsible to conduct market research appropriate to the  circumstances, including seeking of domestic sources. This applies to  acquisition of an article as--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An end product; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A significant component (valued at more than 50 percent of the  value of all the components).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The determination in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does  not apply if the contracting officer learns at any time before the time  designated for receipt of bids in sealed bidding or final offers in  negotiation that an article on the list is available domestically in  sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a  satisfactory quality to meet the requirements of the solicitation. The  contracting officer must--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Ensure that the appropriate Buy American statute provision and  clause are included in the solicitation (see 25.1101(a), 25.1101(b), or  25.1102);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Specify in the solicitation that the article is available  domestically and that offerors and contractors may not treat foreign  components of the same class or kind as domestic components; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Submit a copy of supporting documentation to the appropriate  council identified in 1.201-1, in accordance with agency procedures, for  possible removal of the article from the list.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Individual determinations. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The head of the contracting  activity may make a determination that an article, material, or supply  is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in  sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a  satisfactory quality.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the contracting officer considers that the nonavailability  of an article is likely to affect future acquisitions, the contracting  officer may submit a copy of the determination and supporting  documentation to the appropriate council identified in 1.201-1, in  accordance with agency procedures, for possible addition to the list in  25.104.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A written determination is not required if all of the following  conditions are present:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The acquisition was conducted through use of full and open  competition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The acquisition was synopsized in accordance with 5.201.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No offer for a domestic end product was received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unreasonable cost. The contracting officer may determine that  the cost of a domestic end product would be unreasonable, in accordance  with 25.105 and Subpart 25.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Resale. The contracting officer may purchase foreign end  products specifically for commissary resale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Information technology that is a commercial item. The  restriction on purchasing foreign end products does not apply to the  acquisition of information technology that is a commercial item, when  using fiscal year 2004 or subsequent fiscal year funds (Section 535(a)  of Division F, Title V, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, and  similar sections in subsequent appropriations acts).
