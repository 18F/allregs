                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Each veteran's case will be assigned to a specific case status from the point of initial contact until all appropriate steps in the rehabilitation process have been completed. The case status system will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assist VR&E; staff to fulfill its case management responsibility to provide authorized assistance to enable the veteran to successfully pursue his or her program; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assure program management and accountability.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3107)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Responsibility for change of case status. The case manager is responsible for assigning a case to the appropriate case status at each point in the rehabilitation process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Case manager. The VR&E; (Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment) Officer or his or her designee will assign a case manager when the veteran's case is placed in evaluation and planning status. The VR&E; Officer or his or her designee may assign case management responsibility for development and implementation of a rehabilitation plan authorized under Chapter 31 to a counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation specialist in the VR&E; Division. The case manager assigned will, unless replaced by the VR&E; Officer, continue to be responsible for case management throughout the course of the veteran's rehabilitation program. When securing medical care, treatment, and other related services, the VR&E; case manager will coordinate with Veterans Health Administration (VHA) staff members who have case management responsibility for the veteran.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3106(e))</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Informing the veteran. The veteran will be informed in writing of changes in case status by VA which affect his or her receipt of benefits and services under Chapter 31. The letter to the veteran will include the reason for the change of case status, and other information required under provisions of Sec. 21.420.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3107)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Normal progression for eligible veterans. The cases of veterans who are eligible for and entitled to services under Chapter 31 for whom individualized plans have been prepared will generally undergo the following changes of status:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Individualized written rehabilitation plan. A veteran with an IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan) will generally move sequentially from applicant status through evaluation and planning status, rehabilitation to the point of employability status, employment services status, and rehabilitated status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Individualized extended evaluation plan. A veteran with an IEEP (Individualized Extended Evaluation Plan) will generally move from applicant status through evaluation and planning status to extended evaluation status. Once in extended evaluation status there will generally be a finding which leads to development of an IWRP (paragraph (e)(1) of this section), or IILP (Individualized Independent Living Plan) (paragraph (e)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Individualized independent living plan. A veteran with an IILP (Individualized Independent Living Plan) will generally move from applicant status through evaluation and planning, extended evaluation, independent living, and rehabilitated status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Individualized employment assistance plan. (i) A veteran with an IEAP (Individualized Employment Assistance Plan) which is a part of an IWRP will move through the case statuses described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or in some cases through the steps in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A veteran with an IEAP (Individualized Employment Assistance Plan) which is a part of an IWRP will move through the case statuses described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or in some cases through the steps in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A veteran for whom only employment services are provided will generally move from applicant through evaluation and planning, employment services to rehabilitated status.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3107)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Normal progression for ineligible veterans. A veteran found ineligible for services under Chapter 31 will generally move from applicant to evaluation and planning status, to ineligible status.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3107)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Changes of status. The case manager may change the case status when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Conditions for change specified in the status are met;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The change is not specifically precluded by the status to which change is being considered; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The change is consistent with provisions of other applicable regulations.

Sec. 21.182  ``Applicant'' status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purposes of applicant status are to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Process a veteran's claim for assistance under Chapter 31 in a timely manner; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify service-disabled veterans whom VA should contact individually to increase their awareness and understanding of how they may benefit from services furnished under Chapter 31.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3102)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assignment to applicant status. VA will assign a veteran's records to applicant status when either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> VA receives a formal or informal application from a veteran for services under Chapter 31; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The VR&E; (Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment) Division:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Advises a veteran in writing of the veteran's potential eligibility for Chapter 31 services, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is informed that the veteran has been advised in writing of his or her potential eligibility for Chapter 31 services by other VA elements.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3102(2))</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Termination of applicant status. Applicant status will be terminated when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An appointment for an initial evaluation has been kept by the veteran; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The veteran's service-connected disability is reduced to a noncompensable degree; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The veteran's service-connected disability is severed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The veteran's application is invalid because of fraud or error; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The veteran withdraws his or her claim, or otherwise indicates that no further assistance is desired.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3106)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Transfer of terminated cases to discontinued status. Each instance in

which a veteran's case is terminated for reasons described in paragraph (c)(4) or (5) of this section shall be placed in discontinued status.

Sec. 21.184  ``Evaluation and planning'' status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of evaluation and planning status is to identify veterans for whom evaluation and planing services are needed to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Accomplish an initial evaluation as provided in Sec. 21.50;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Develop an IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan), IEEP (Individualized Extended Evaluation Plan), IILP (Individualized Independent Living Plan) or IEAP (Individualized Employment Assistance Plan); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reevaluate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Findings made in prior initial evaluations, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Current or previous individualized rehabilitation plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assignment to evaluation and planning status. A veteran's records will be assigned to evaluation and planning status for any of the purposes specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Termination of evaluation and planning status. The assignment of the veteran's records to evaluation and planning status may be terminated under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Evaluation and planning completed. The services necessary to complete evaluation and planning have been provided. These services are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Completion of an initial evaluation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Development of an IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan) or other individual rehabilitation plan in those cases in which eligibility and entitlement to services provided under Chapter 31 are established; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Completion of reevaluation of prior findings made in initial evaluation or modification of a rehabilitation plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Evaluation and planning not completed. The VR&E; Division shall make every reasonable effort to enable the veteran to complete the evaluation and planning phase of the rehabilitation process. A determination that every reasonable effort by VA has been made, and that little likelihood exists that continued efforts will lead to completion of planning and evaluation, may be made under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The veteran writes VA and requests that his or her case be inactivated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The veteran fails to keep scheduled appointments following his or her initial appointment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The veteran otherwise fails to cooperate with VA in the evaluation and planning process. If the veteran fails to cooperate, the provisions of Sec. 21.362 are applicable.

Sec. 21.186  ``Ineligible'' status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of ineligible status is to identify the cases in which a veteran requests services under Chapter 31, but the request is denied by VA, usually, on the basis of information developed when the veteran was in evaluation and planning status.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3106)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assignment to ineligible status. A veteran's case will be assigned to ineligible status following a finding by VA that the veteran is not eligible for or entitled to services under Chapter 31. The finding must preclude all possible Chapter 31 services.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3106, 3107)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Termination of ineligible status. The assignment of the veteran's case to ineligible status should be terminated if the veteran thereafter becomes eligible to receive any Chapter 31 service. Placement of the case in ineligible status is a bar to reconsideration of eligibility unless a material change in circumstances occurs.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3106)



Sec. 21.188  ``Extended evaluation'' status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose.

Sec. 21.197  ``Interrupted'' status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of interrupted status is to recognize that a variety of situations may arise in the course of a rehabilitation program in which a temporary suspension of the program is warranted. In each case, VA first must determine that the veteran will be able to return to a rehabilitation program or a program of employment services following the resolution of the situation causing the interruption. This determination will be documented in the veteran's record.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3117)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assignment to ``interrupted'' status. A veteran's case will be assigned to interrupted status when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> VA determines that a suspension of services being provided is necessary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A definite date for resumption of the program is established; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The evidence indicates the veteran will be able to resume the program at some future date, which can be approximately established.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3110)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reasons for assignment to ``interrupted'' status. A veteran's case may be interrupted and assigned to interrupted status for reasons including but not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Veteran does not initiate or continue rehabilitation process. If a veteran does not begin or continue the rehabilitation process, the veteran's case will be interrupted and assigned to interrupted status, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A case in evaluation and planning status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A case in extended evaluation status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A case in rehabilitation to the point of employability status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A case in independent living program status; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A case in employment services status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unsatisfactory conduct and cooperation. If a veteran's conduct or cooperation becomes unsatisfactory, services and assistance may be interrupted as determined under provisions of Sec. Sec. 21.362 and 21.364.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Services not available. The veteran cannot continue the program because the necessary training and rehabilitation services are unavailable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Prior to assignment to ``discontinued'' status. A veteran's case shall be assigned to interrupted status prior to discontinuance and assignment to discontinued status in all cases except as provided in Sec. 21.182(d) and upon the veteran's death.
