                                Sec. 60-2.2  Agency action.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any contractor required by Sec. 60-2.1 to develop and maintain  a written affirmative action program for each of its establishments that  has not complied with that section is not in full compliance with  Executive Order 11246, as amended. When a contractor is required to  submit its affirmative action program to OFCCP (e.g., for a compliance  evaluation), the affirmative action program will be deemed to have been  accepted by the Government at the time OFCCP notifies the contractor of  completion of the compliance evaluation or other action, unless within  45 days thereafter the Deputy Assistant Secretary has disapproved such  program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, in determining such contractor's responsibility for an award  of a contract it comes to the contracting officer's attention, through  sources within his/her agency or through the OFCCP or other Government  agencies, that the contractor does not have an affirmative action  program at each of its establishments, or has substantially deviated  from such an approved affirmative action program, or has failed to  develop or implement an affirmative action program which complies with  the regulations in this chapter, the contracting officer must declare  the contractor/bidder nonresponsible and so notify the contractor and  the Deputy Assistant Secretary, unless the contracting officer otherwise  affirmatively determines that the contractor is able to comply with the  equal employment obligations. Any contractor/bidder which has been  declared nonresponsible in accordance with the provisions of this  section may request the Deputy Assistant Secretary to determine that the  responsibility of the contractor/bidder raises substantial issues of law  or fact to the extent that a hearing is required. Such request must set  forth the basis upon which the contractor/bidder seeks such a  determination. If the Deputy Assistant Secretary, in his/her sole  discretion, determines that substantial issues of law or fact exist, an  administrative or judicial proceeding may be commenced in accordance  with the regulations contained in Sec. 60-1.26; or the Deputy Assistant  Secretary may require the investigation or compliance evaluation be  developed further or additional conciliation be conducted: Provided,  That during any pre-award conferences, every effort will be made through  the processes of conciliation, mediation, and persuasion to develop an  acceptable affirmative action program meeting the standards and  guidelines set forth in this part so that, in the performance of the  contract, the contractor is able to meet its equal employment  obligations in accordance with the equal opportunity clause and  applicable rules, regulations, and orders: Provided further, That a  contractor/bidder may not be declared nonresponsible more than twice due  to past noncompliance with the equal opportunity clause at a particular  establishment or facility without receiving   prior notice and an opportunity for a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> Immediately upon finding that a contractor has no affirmative  action program, or has deviated substantially from an approved  affirmative action program, or has failed to develop or implement an  affirmative action program which complies with the requirements of the  regulations in this chapter, that fact shall be recorded in the  investigation file. Except as provided in Sec. 60-1.26(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, whenever  administrative enforcement is contemplated, the notice to the contractor  shall be issued giving the contractor 30 days to show cause why  enforcement proceedings under section 209(a) of Executive Order 11246,  as amended, should not be instituted. The notice to show cause should  contain:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An itemization of the sections of the Executive Order and of the  regulations with which the contractor has been found in apparent  violation, and a summary of the conditions, practices, facts, or  circumstances which give rise to each apparent violation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The corrective actions necessary to achieve compliance or, as  may be appropriate, the concepts and principles of an acceptable remedy  and/or the corrective action results anticipated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A request for a written response to the findings, including  commitments to corrective action or the presentation of opposing facts  and evidence; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A suggested date for the conciliation conference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the contractor fails to show good cause for its failure or  fails to remedy that failure by developing and implementing an  acceptable affirmative action program within 30 days, the case file  shall be processed for enforcement proceedings pursuant to Sec. 60-1.26  of this chapter. If an administrative complaint is filed, the contractor  shall have 20 days to request a hearing. If a request for hearing has  not been received within 20 days from the filing of the administrative  complaint, the matter shall proceed in accordance with part 60-30 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During the ``show cause'' period of 30 days, every effort will  be made through conciliation, mediation, and persuasion to resolve the  deficiencies which led to the determination of nonresponsibility. If  satisfactory adjustments designed to bring the contractor into  compliance are not concluded, the case shall be processed for  enforcement proceedings pursuant to Sec. 60-1.26 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During the ``show cause'' period and formal proceedings, each  contracting agency must continue to determine the contractor's  responsibility in considering whether or not to award a new or  additional contract.</p>
