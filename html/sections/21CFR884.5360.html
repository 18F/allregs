The device is placed high in the uterine fundus with a string extending from the device through the cervical os into the vagina. This generic type of device includes the introducer, but does not include contraceptive IUD's that function by drug activity, which are subject to the new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (see Sec.  310.502).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class III (premarket approval).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Labeling. Labeling requirements for contraceptive IUD's are set forth in Sec.  801.427.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Date premarket approval application (PMA) or notice of completion of a product development protocol (PDP) is required. A PMA or a notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with the Food and Drug Administration on or before August 4, 1986, for any IUD and introducer that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that has on or before August 4, 1986, been found to be substantially equivalent to an IUD and introducer that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. Any other IUD and introducer shall have an approved PMA or a declared completed PDP in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
