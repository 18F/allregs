                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope of opt-out election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The consumer's  election to opt out prohibits any covered affiliate subject to the scope  of the opt-out notice from using eligibility information received from  another affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continuing relationship--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. If the consumer  establishes a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its  affiliate, an opt-out notice may apply to eligibility information  obtained in connection with--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A single continuing relationship or multiple continuing  relationships that the consumer establishes with a covered affiliate or  its affiliates, including continuing relationships established  subsequent to delivery of the opt-out notice, so long as the notice  adequately describes the continuing relationships covered by the opt  out; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any other transaction between the consumer and the covered  affiliate or its affiliates as described in the notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples of a continuing relationship. A consumer has a  continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The covered affiliate is a futures commission merchant through  whom a consumer has opened an account, or that carries the consumer's  account on a fully-disclosed basis, or that effects or engages in  commodity interest transactions with or for a consumer, even if the  covered affiliate does not hold any assets of the consumer;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The covered affiliate is an introducing broker that solicits or  accepts specific orders for trades;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The covered affiliate is a commodity trading advisor with whom a  consumer has a contract or subscription, either written or oral,  regardless of whether the advice is standardized, or is based on, or  tailored to, the commodity interest or cash market positions or other  circumstances or characteristics of the particular consumer;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The covered affiliate is a commodity pool operator, and accepts  or receives from the consumer, funds, securities, or property for the  purpose of purchasing an interest in a commodity pool;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The covered affiliate is a major swap participant that holds  securities or other assets as collateral for a loan made to the  consumer, even if the covered affiliate did not make the loan or do not  affect any transactions on behalf of the consumer; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The covered affiliate is a swap dealer that regularly effects or  engages in swap transactions with or for a consumer even if the covered  affiliate does not hold any assets of the consumer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No continuing relationship--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. If there is no  continuing relationship between a consumer and the covered affiliate or  its affiliate, and the covered affiliate or its affiliate obtain  eligibility information about a consumer in connection with a  transaction with the consumer, such as an isolated transaction or a  credit application that is denied, an opt-out notice provided to the  consumer only applies to eligibility information obtained in connection  with that transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples of no continuing relationship. A consumer does not  have a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate  if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The covered affiliate has acted solely as a ``finder'' for a  futures commission merchant, and the covered affiliate does not solicit  or accept specific orders for trades; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The covered affiliate has solicited the consumer to participate  in a pool or to direct his or her account and he or she has not provided  the covered affiliate with funds to participate in a pool or entered  into any agreement with the covered affiliate to direct his or her  account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Menu of alternatives. A consumer may be given the opportunity to  choose from a menu of alternatives when electing to prohibit  solicitations, such as by electing to prohibit solicitations from  certain types of affiliates covered by the opt-out notice but not other  types of affiliates covered by the   notice, electing to prohibit solicitations based on certain types of  eligibility information but not other types of eligibility information,  or electing to prohibit solicitations by certain methods of delivery but  not other methods of delivery. However, one of the alternatives must  allow the consumer to prohibit all solicitations from all of the  affiliates that are covered by the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special rule for a notice following termination of all  continuing relationships. A consumer must be given a new opt-out notice  if, after all continuing relationships with the covered affiliate or its  affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes  another continuing relationship with the covered affiliate or its  affiliate(s) and the consumer's eligibility information is to be used to  make a solicitation. The new opt-out notice must apply, at a minimum, to  eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing  relationship. Consistent with paragraph b of this section, the  consumer's decision not to opt out after receiving the new opt-out  notice would not override a prior opt-out election by the consumer that  applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with a  terminated relationship, regardless of whether the new opt-out notice  applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with the  terminated relationship.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duration of opt-out election. An opt-out election must be  effective for a period of at least five years beginning when the  consumer's opt-out election is received and implemented, unless the  consumer subsequently revokes the opt-out election in writing or, if the  consumer agrees, electronically. An opt-out election may be established  for a period of more than five years or for an indefinite period unless  revoked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time period in which a consumer can opt out. A consumer may opt  out at any time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No effect on opt-out period. An opt-out period may not be  shortened by sending a renewal notice to the consumer before expiration  of the opt-out period, even if the consumer does not renew the opt out.</p>
