All States and units of general local government and nonprofit organizations are eligible to apply for competitive grants to fund projects of national significance. Only those States and units of general local government that do not qualify for formula allocations are eligible to apply for competitive grants to fund other projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If HUD makes a procedural error in a funding competition that, when corrected, would warrant funding of an otherwise eligible application, HUD will select that application for potential funding when sufficient funds become available.
