                            <p class="depth0">Nothing in this subpart shall preclude a common carrier or  information provider from blocking or ordering the blocking of its  interstate pay-per-call programs from numbers assigned to subscribers  who have incurred, but not paid, legitimate pay-per-call charges, except  that a subscriber who has filed a complaint regarding a particular pay- per-call program pursuant to procedures established by the Federal Trade  Commission under title III of the TDDRA shall not be involuntarily  blocked from access to that program while such a complaint is pending.  This restriction is not intended to preclude involuntary blocking when a  carrier or IP has decided in one instance to sustain charges against a  subscriber but   that subscriber files additional separate complaints.</p>
