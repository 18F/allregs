No alternate method or procedure relating to the assessment, payment, or collection of tax shall be authorized under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the taxpayer desires to employ an alternate method or procedure, a written application to do so must be submitted. The application must specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure and must set forth the reasons therefor. Alternate methods or procedures must not be employed until the appropriate TTB officer has approved the application. The taxpayer must, during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization for any alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer, the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of such authorization.
