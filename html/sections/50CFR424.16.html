                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Based on the information received through Sec. Sec.  424.13, 424.14, 424.15, and 424.21, or through other available avenues,  the Secretary may propose revising the lists as described in Sec.  424.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents. A notice of a proposed rule to carry out one of the  actions described in Sec. 424.10 will contain a detailed description of  the proposed action and a summary of the data on which the proposal is  based (including, as appropriate, citation of pertinent information  sources) and will show the relationship of such data to the rule  proposed. If such a rule proposes to designate or revise critical  habitat, such summary will, to the maximum extent practicable, include a  brief description and evaluation of those activities (whether public or  private) that, in the opinion of the Secretary, if undertaken, may  adversely modify such habitat or may be affected by such designation.  For any proposed rule to designate or revise critical habitat, the  detailed description of the action will include a map of the critical  habitat area, and may also include rule text that clarifies or modifies  the map. Any such notice proposing the listing, delisting, or  reclassification of a species or the designation or revision of critical  habitat will also include a summary of factors affecting the species  and/or its designated critical habitat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notifications. In the case of any proposed rule  to list, delist, or reclassify a species, or to designate or revise  critical habitat, the Secretary shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Publish notice of the proposal in the Federal Register;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Give actual notice of the proposed regulation to the State  agency in each State in which the species is believed to occur and to  each county or equivalent jurisdiction therein in which the species is  believed to occur, and invite the comment of each such agency and  jurisdiction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Give notice of the proposed regulation to any Federal  agencies, local authorities, or private individuals or organizations  known to be affected by the rule;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Insofar as practical, and in cooperation with the Secretary of  State,   give notice of the proposed regulation to list, delist, or reclassify a  species to each foreign nation in which the species is believed to occur  or whose citizens harvest the species on the high seas, and invite the  comment of such nation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Give notice of the proposed regulation to such professional  scientific organizations as the Secretary deems appropriate; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Publish a summary of the proposed regulation in a newspaper of  general circulation in each area of the United States in which the  species is believed to occur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Period of public comments. At least 60 days shall be allowed for  public comment following publication in the Federal Register of a rule  proposing the listing, delisting, or reclassification of a species, or  the designation or revision of critical habitat. All other proposed  rules shall be subject to a comment period of at least 30 days following  publication in the Federal Register. The Secretary may extend or reopen  the period for public comment on a proposed rule upon a finding that  there is good cause to do so. A notice of any such extension or  reopening shall be published in the Federal Register, and shall specify  the basis for so doing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Public hearings. The Secretary shall promptly hold at least one  public hearing if any person so requests within 45 days of publication  of a proposed regulation to list, delist, or reclassify a species, or to  designate or revise critical habitat. Notice of the location and time of  any such hearing shall be published in the Federal Register not less  than 15 days before the hearing is held.
