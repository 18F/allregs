In this regard, the Commission will examine the record in rule making proceedings to determine the availability of existing and potential non-commercial education service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the course of the rule making proceeding to amend Sec. 73.202(b) or Sec. 73.606(b), the Commission may modify the license or permit of an FM or television broadcast station to specify a new community of license where the amended allotment would be mutually exclusive with the licensee's or permittee's present assignment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Whenever an expression of interest in applying for, constructing, and operating a station has been filed in a proceeding to amend the FM or TV Table of Allotments, and the filing party

seeks to dismiss or withdraw the expression of interest, either unilaterally or in exchange for financial consideration, that party must file with the Commission a request for approval of the dismissal or withdrawal, a copy of any written agreement related to the dismissal or withdrawal, and an affidavit setting forth:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A certification that neither the party withdrawing its interest nor its principals has received or will receive any money or other consideration in excess of legitimate and prudent expenses in exchange for the dismissal or withdrawal of the expression of interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or promised;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks reimbursement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The terms of any oral agreement related to the dismissal or withdrawal of the expression of interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In addition, within 5 days of a party's request for approval, each remaining party to any written or oral agreement must submit an affidavit setting forth:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A certification that neither it nor its principals has paid or will pay money or other consideration in excess of the legitimate and prudent expenses of the party withdrawing its expression of interest; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The terms of any oral agreement relating to the dismissal or withdrawal of the expression of interest.</p><p class="depth4">Note to Sec. 1.420: The reclassification of a Class C station in accordance with the procedure set forth in Note 4 to Sec. 73.3573 may be initiated through the filing of an original petition for amendment of the FM Table of Allotments. The Commission will notify the affected Class C station licensee of the proposed reclassification by issuing a notice of proposed rule making, except that where a triggering petition proposes an amendment or amendments to the FM Table of Allotments in addition to the proposed reclassification, the Commission will issue an order to show cause as set forth in Note 4 to Sec. 73.3573, and a notice of proposed rule making will be issued only after the reclassification issue is resolved. Triggering petitions will be dismissed upon the filing, rather than the grant, of an acceptable construction permit application to increase antenna height to at least 451 meters HAAT by a subject Class C station.
