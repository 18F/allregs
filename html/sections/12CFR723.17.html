                                Sec. 723.17  Are there any exceptions to the aggregate loan limit?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">There are three circumstances where a credit union qualifies for an exception from the aggregate limit. Loans that are excepted from the definition of member business loans are not counted for the purpose of the exceptions. The three exceptions are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Credit unions that have a low-income designation or participate in the Community Development Financial Institutions program;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Credit unions that were chartered for the purpose of making member business loans and can provide documentary evidence (such evidence includes but is not limited to the original charter, original bylaws, original business plan, original field of membership, board minutes and loan portfolio);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Credit unions that have a history of primarily making member business loans, meaning that either member business loans comprise at least 25% of the credit union's outstanding loans (as evidenced in any call report filed between January 1995 and September 1998 or any equivalent documentation including financial statements) or member business loans comprise the largest portion of the credit union's loan portfolio (as evidenced in any call report filed between January 1995 and September 1998 or any equivalent documentation including financial statements). For example, if a credit union makes 23% member business loans, 22% first mortgage loans, 22% new automobile loans, 20% credit card loans, and 13% total other real estate loans, then the credit union meets this exception.</p>
