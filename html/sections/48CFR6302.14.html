                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pleadings. The Board upon its own initiative or upon application by a party may, in its discretion, order a

party to make a more definite statement of the complaint or answer, or to reply to an answer. The application for such an order suspends the time for responsive pleading. The Board may, in its discretion and within the proper scope of the appeal, permit either party to amend its pleadings upon conditions just to both parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Record. When an issue within the proper scope of the appeal, but not raised by the pleadings, is tried by consent of the parties or by permission of the Board, the issue is treated in all respects as if it had been raised. A motion to amend the pleadings to conform to the proof may be made but is not required. If evidence is objected to at a hearing on the ground that it is not within an issue raised by the pleadings, it may be admitted in evidence, but the objecting party may be granted a continuance if necessary to enable him to meet such evidence.</p>
