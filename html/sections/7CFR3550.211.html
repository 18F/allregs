                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy. When RHS determines that a borrower is unable or unwilling to meet loan obligations, RHS may accelerate the loan and, if necessary, acquire the security property. The borrower is responsible for all expenses associated with liquidation and acquisition. If the account is satisfied in full, the borrower will be released from liability. If the account is not satisfied in full, RHS may pursue any deficiency unless the borrower received a moratorium at any time during the life of the loan and faithfully tried to repay the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tribal allotted or trust land. Liquidations involving a security interest in tribal allotted or trust land shall only be pursued after offering to transfer the account to an eligible tribal member, the tribe, or the Indian Housing Authority. Forced liquidation of RHS security interests in Indian trust lands or on tribal allotted land will be recommended only after the State Director has determined it is in the best interest of the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acceleration and foreclosure. If RHS determines that foreclosure is in the best interest of the Government, RHS will send an acceleration notice to each borrower and any cosigner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Voluntary liquidation. Borrowers may voluntarily liquidate through:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Refinancing or sale. The borrower may refinance or sell the security property for at least net recovery value and apply the proceeds to the account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deed in lieu of foreclosure. RHS may accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure to convey title to the security property only after the debt has been accelerated and when it is in the Government's best interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Offer by third party. If a junior lienholder or cosigner makes an offer in the amount of at least the net recovery value, RHS may assign the note and mortgage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Bankruptcy. (1) When a petition in bankruptcy is filed by a borrower after

acceleration, collection actions and foreclosure actions are suspended in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a petition in bankruptcy is filed by a borrower after

acceleration, collection actions and foreclosure actions are suspended in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> RHS may accept conveyance of security property by the trustee in bankruptcy if the Bankruptcy Court has approved the transaction, RHS determines the conveyance is in the best interest of the Government, and RHS will acquire title free of all liens and encumbrances except RHS liens.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whenever possible in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, a reaffirmation agreement will be signed by the borrower and approved by the court prior to discharge, if RHS decides to continue with the borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Junior lienholder foreclosure. When a junior lienholder foreclosure does not result in payment in full of the RHS debt but the property is sold subject to the RHS lien, RHS may liquidate the account unless the new owner is eligible to assume the RHS debt and actually assumes the RHS debt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment subsidy. If the borrower is receiving payment subsidy, the payment subsidy agreement will not be canceled when the debt is accelerated, but will not be renewed unless the account is reinstated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Eligibility for special servicing actions. A borrower is not eligible for special servicing actions once the account has been accelerated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reporting. RHS may report to IRS and credit reporting agencies any debt settled through liquidation.
