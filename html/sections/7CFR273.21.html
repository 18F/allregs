                                Sec. 273.21  Monthly Reporting and Retrospective Budgeting (MRRB).
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> System design. This section provides for an MRRB system for  determining household eligibility and benefits. For included households,  this system replaces the prospective budgeting system provided in the  preceding sections of this part. The MRRB system provides for the use of  retrospective information in calculating household benefits, normally  based on information submitted by the household in monthly reports. The  State agency shall establish an MRRB system as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In establishing either a one-month or a two-month MRRB system,  the State agency shall use the same system it uses in its TANF Program  unless it has been granted a waiver by FNS. Differences between a one- month and a two-month system are described in paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State agency shall determine eligibility, either  prospectively or retrospectively, on the same basis that it uses for its  TANF program, unless it has been granted a waiver by FNS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Budgeting waivers. FNS may approve waivers of the budgeting  requirements of this section to conform to budgeting procedures in the  TANF program, except for households excluded from retrospective  budgeting under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Included and excluded households. The establishment of either a  monthly reporting or retrospective budgeting system is a State agency  option. Certain households are specifically excluded from both monthly  reporting and retrospective budgeting. A household that is included in a  monthly reporting system must be retrospectively budgeted. Households  not required to submit monthly reports may have their benefits  determined on either a prospective or retrospective basis at the State  agency's option, unless specifically excluded from retrospective  budgeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The following households are excluded from both monthly  reporting and retrospective budgeting:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Migrant or seasonal farmworker households.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Households in which all members are homeless individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Households with no earned income in which all adult members  are elderly or disabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Households residing on an Indian reservation where there was no  monthly reporting system in operation on March 25, 1994 are excluded  from monthly reporting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Information on MRRB. At the certification and recertification  interview, the State agency shall provide the household with the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An oral explanation of the purpose of MRRB;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A copy of the monthly report and an explanation of how to  complete and file it;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An explanation that information required to be reported on the  monthly report is the only reporting requirement for such information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An explanation of what the household shall verify when it  submits a monthly report and how it will verify it;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A telephone number (toll-free number or a number where collect  calls will be accepted outside the local calling area) which the  household may call to ask questions or to obtain help in completing the  monthly report; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Written explanations of this information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Special assistance. The State agency shall provide special  assistance in completing and filing monthly reports to households whose  adult members are all either mentally or physically handicapped or are  non-English speaking or otherwise lacking in reading and writing skills  such that they cannot complete and file the required reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> One and two-month systems. Each State agency shall adopt either  a one-month or two-month MRRB system. A one-month system shall have  either one or two beginning months in the certification period and a  two-month system shall have two beginning months. Except for beginning  months in sequence as described in the preceding sentence, the State  agency shall not consider as a beginning month any month which  immediately follows a month in which a household is certified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> One-month system. In the one-month system, the issuance month  immediately follows its corresponding budget month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Two-month system. In the two-month system, the issuance month is  the second month following its corresponding budget month. There are two  beginning months of participation in this system, the first month and  the following month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Determining eligibility for households not certified under the  beginning months' procedures of Sec. 273.21(g). The State agency shall  determine eligibility consistent with paragraph (a)(2) of this section  and in accordance with either of the following options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prospective eligibility. The State agency shall determine  eligibility by considering all factors of eligibility prospectively for  each of the issuance months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Retrospective eligibility. The State agency shall determine  eligibility by considering all factors of eligibility retrospectively  using the appropriate budget month except for residency and compliance  with the requirements regarding social security numbers. Compliance with  work registration provisions shall be considered as of the issuance  month or month of application. The 60-day time frame for determining the  applicability of the voluntary quit provision of Sec. 273.7(n) shall be  measured by the State agency from the date of application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Calculating allotments for households following the beginning  months--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Household composition. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If eligibility is determined  retrospectively the State agency shall determine the household's  composition as of the last day of the budget month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If eligibility is determined prospectively (during the  beginning months or for households processed under paragraph (e)(1) of  this section), the State agency shall determine the household's  composition as of the issuance month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In a two-month system, the following provisions shall apply  with regard to a household which reports, in the month between the  budget month and the corresponding issuance month, that it has gained a  new member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The State agency shall use the same household composition for  determining the household's eligibility that it uses for calculating the  household's benefit level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the new member is not already certified to receive food  stamps in another household participating within the State, the new  member's income, deductible expenses, and resources from the issuance  month shall be considered in determining the household's eligibility and  benefit level. If the new member had been providing income to the  household on an ongoing basis prior to becoming a member of the  household, the State agency shall exclude the previously provided income  in determining the household's issuance month benefits and eligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the individual has moved out of one household receiving food  stamps within the State and into another, with no break in  participation, the State agency shall use the individual's income,  deductible expenses, and resources from the budget month in determining  benefits to be provided in the issuance month. The State agency shall  include such an individual and the individual's income, deductible  expenses, and resources in determining the issuance month eligibility  and benefit level of either the household from which the individual has  moved or the household into which the individual has moved, but not  both. In determining the issuance month eligibility and benefit level of  the household into which the individual has moved, the State agency  shall disregard budget month income received by the new member from a  terminated source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The State agency may add new members to the household effective  either the month the household reports the gain of a new household  member or the first day of the issuance month following the month the  household reports the gain of a new member. The benefits shall not be  prorated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The State agency shall add a previously excluded member who was  disqualified for an intentional program violation or failure to comply  with workfare or work requirements, was ineligible because of failure to  comply with the social security number requirement, or was previously an  ineligible alien retrospectively to the household the month after the  disqualification period ends. All other previously excluded members  shall be added in accordance with the procedures in paragraph  (f)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, using the new member's issuance month  income and expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Income and deductions. For the household members as determined  in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the State agency  shall calculate the allotment using the household members' income and  deductions from the budget month, except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State agency shall annualize self-employment income which is  received other than monthly, in accordance with Sec. 273.11(a). Such  income shall be budgeted either prospectively or retrospectively and  shall not affect more benefit months than the number of months in the  period over which it is annualized or prorated. Except that, households  which receive self-employment income from a farm operation monthly but  incur irregular expenses to produce such self-employment farm income  shall be given the option to annualize the self-employment farm income  and expenses over a 12-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State agency shall prorate contract income received over a  period of less than one year and either prospectively or retrospectively  budget such income. Such income shall not effect more benefit months  than the number of months in the period over which it is prorated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>, and it shall be budgeted either prospectively or  retrospectively. Such income shall not effect more benefit months than  the number of months in the period over which it is prorated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The State agency shall budget deductible expenses prorated over  two or more months, except medical expenses, either prospectively or  retrospectively, provided That such deductions are not budgeted over  more months than they are intended to cover, and the total amount  deducted does not exceed the total amount of the expenses. Medical  expenses shall be budgeted prospectively. The State agency shall  continue to allow deductions for expenses incurred even if   billed on other than a monthly basis unless the household reports a  change in the expense. The State agency may average the child support  expense and budget it prospectively or retrospectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The State agency shall budget income received on a recurring  monthly or semimonthly basis for the month that it is intended to cover.  The State agency shall not vary the budgeting of such income merely  because it is received during another month as the result of changes in  mailing cycles or pay dates, or because weekends or holidays result in  an additional or missed payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> (A), (B), or (C) of this  section. The State agency shall either establish categories of interest  to be handled by each of the methods or shall offer each household the  option of which method to budget the interest income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Actual interest income received in the budget month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Prorated interest income calculated by dividing the amount of  interest anticipated during the certification period by the number of  months in the certification period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An averaged amount adjusted for anticipated changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For a new household member described under paragraph  (f)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, the State agency shall consider the new  member's income and deductible expenses prospectively until the new  member's first month living with the household becomes the budget month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The options provided under paragraph (j)(1)(vii) of this  section may affect the calculation of income and deductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Determining eligibility and allotments in the beginning months.  The State agency shall use the prospective budgeting procedures of this  paragraph for determining the allotments and eligibility of households  in the MRRB system during this first month, or first and second month of  participation. The State agency shall not apply the procedures of this  paragraph to the month(s) following the month of termination resulting  from a temporary one-month change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determining eligibility during the beginning months. The State  agency shall determine eligibility prospectively in the beginning  month(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calculating allotments during the beginning months. the State  agency shall calculate allotments prospectively in the beginning  month(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The first months of retrospective budgeting following the  beginning months. The State agency shall begin to base issuances to the  household on retrospective budgeting during the first month for which  the State's system can use the month of application as a budget month.  In a one-month system, the first month for which the issuance is based  on retrospective budgeting shall be the second month of participation.  In a two-month system, the first month for which the issuance is based  on retrospective budgeting shall be the third month of participation. If  the State agency had been averaging income or converting weekly or  biweekly income to a monthly amount in the beginning months, it may  begin using the household's actual budget month income when the  household becomes subject to retrospective budgeting. For purposes of  this paragraph, any income received in either or both of the beginning  months from a source which no longer provides income to the household  (terminated income), which was included in the household's prospective  budget, shall be disregarded when the beginning month becomes the budget  month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The monthly report form--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State agency shall  give the household a reasonable period of time after close of the budget  month to submit the monthly reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State agency shall require each household in the MRRB  system to report on household circumstances on a monthly basis as a  condition of continuing eligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The State agency shall provide an individual or agency unit  which a household may contact to receive prompt answers about the  completion of the form. A telephone number (toll free for households  outside the local calling area) which a household may   use to obtain further information shall also be available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The State agency shall ensure that households are informed  about the availability and amount of the standard utility allowances, if  the State agency offers them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Monthly report form. The State agency's monthly report form  shall meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be written in clear, simple language;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Meet the bilingual requirements described in Sec. 272.4(b) of  this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Specify the date by which the agency must receive the form and  the consequences of a late or incomplete form, including whether the  State agency shall delay payment if the form is not received by the  specified date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Specify the verification which the household must submit with  the form, in accordance with Sec. 273.21(i);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Identify the individual or agency unit available to assist in  completing the form:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Include a statement to be signed by a member of the household,  indicating his or her understanding that the provided information may  result in changes in the level of benefits, including reduction and  termination;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Include, in prominent and boldface lettering, an  understandable description of the Act's civil and criminal penalties for  fraud.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> If the form requests Social Security numbers, include a  statement of the State agency's authority to require Social Security  numbers (SSN's) (including the statutory citation, the title of the  statute, and the fact that providing SSN's is mandatory), the purpose of  requiring SSN's, the routine uses for SSN's, and the effect of not  providing SSN's. This statement may be on the form itself or included as  an attachment to the form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reported information. The State agency may determine the  information relevant to eligibility and benefit determination to be  included on the monthly report form except that the State agency shall  not require households to monthly report medical expenses. Medical  expenses may be reported in accordance with Sec. 273.10(d)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Combined form. If the State agency uses a combined monthly  report for food stamps and TANF, the State agency shall clearly indicate  on the form that non-TANF food stamp households need not provide TANF- only information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> shall be obtained prior to the household's  recertification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> State agency action on reports--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Processing. Upon receiving a  monthly report, the State agency shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Review the report to ensure accuracy and completeness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consider the report incomplete only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> It is not signed by the head of the household, an authorized  representative or a responsible member of the household;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> It is not accompanied by verification required by the State  agency on the monthly report;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> It omits information required by the State agency on the monthly  report necessary either to determine the household's eligibility or to  compute the household's level of food stamp benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determine those items which will require additional  verification, in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Contact the household directly, and take action as needed, to  obtain further information on specific items. These items include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The effect of a reported change in resources on a household's  total resources; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The effect of a reported change in household composition or loss  of a job   or source of earned income on the applicability of the work registration  requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Notify the household, in accordance with paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of  this section, of the need to submit a report, correct an incomplete or  inaccurate report, or submit the necessary verification within the  extension period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Determine the household's eligibility by considering all  factors, including income, in accordance with paragraphs (e) or (g) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Determine the household's level of benefits in accordance with  Sec. 273.10(e) based on the household composition determined in  accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

The earned income of an elementary or  secondary school student excluded in accordance with Sec. 273.9(c)(7)  shall be excluded until the budget month following the budget month in  which the student turns 18. The State agency has the option of  converting to a regular monthly amount the income that a household  receives weekly or biweekly. If the State agency elects to convert  weekly or biweekly income for MRRB households, it shall do so for all  households in its MRRB caseload. The State agency may convert or average  income in the beginning months and use actual earned or unearned income  received in the budget month following the beginning months of  participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The PA grant paid in the corresponding budget month or the PA  grant to be paid in the issuance month.

This notice shall also advise the household  that, if a complete report is not filed timely, the household will be  terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the household is terminated, the State agency shall send the  notice so the household receives it no later than the date benefits  would have been received. This notice shall advise the household of its  right to reinstatement if a complete monthly report is submitted by the  end of the month following termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Supplements and claims.
