Since it will be difficult, if not impossible, to prove the exact amount of such damage, the exporter shall pay to CCC promptly on demand, as reasonable compensation and not as a penalty, liquidated damages in lieu of probable actual damages, as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each day of delay in exportation after the final date for exportation, when delivery is made before export under the terms of the financing agreement, .15 percent of the amount financed under the financing agreement for the commodity not exported; (b) for failure to export or cause exportation, when delivery is made before export under the terms of the financing agreement, 5 percent of the amount financed under the financing agreement for the commodity not exported; (c) for failure, after exportation, to enter or cause the entry of the commodity into the country of destination, at the rate of 5 percent a year of the amount financed under the financing agreement for such commodity from the start of the financing period until payment to CCC of the amount financed; Provided however, That the aggregate of all amounts assessed under this Sec. 1488.11 with respect to the same commodity shall not exceed 5 percent of the amount financed for such commodity. Liquidated damages shall not be assessed: Under paragraph (a) of this section if the Assistant Sales manager determines that the delay was due to such causes as acts of God or government or public enemy, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, or unusually severe weather; under paragraph (b) of this section if the Assistant Sales Manager determines that failure to export was due to loss, damage, destruction or deterioration of the commodity or act of God or government or public enemy; and under paragraph (c) of this section if the Assistant Sales Manager determines that failure to enter or cause the entry of the commodity into the country of destination was due to loss, damage, destruction or deterioration of the commodity or act of God or government or public enemy.</p><p class="depth2">Bank Obligations and Repayment</p>
