Since it will be  difficult, if not impossible, to prove the exact amount of such damage,  the exporter shall pay to CCC promptly on demand, as reasonable  compensation and not as a penalty, liquidated damages in lieu of  probable actual damages, as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of this section if  the Assistant Sales manager determines that the delay was due to such  causes as acts of God or government or public enemy, fires, floods,  epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, or  unusually severe weather; under paragraph (b) of this section if the  Assistant Sales Manager determines that failure to export was due to  loss, damage, destruction or deterioration of the commodity or act of  God or government or public enemy; and under paragraph (c) of this  section if the Assistant Sales Manager determines that failure to enter  or cause the entry of the commodity into the country of destination was  due to loss, damage, destruction or deterioration of the commodity or  act of God or government or public enemy.</p><p class="depth2">Bank Obligations and Repayment</p>
