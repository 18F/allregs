The filter(s) shall be inserted in the light path perpendicular to the axis of the beam and adjacent to the opening from which the beam of light from the light source emanates, and the recorder response shall be noted. Filters with exposed filtering media should be checked for opacity every six months; all other filters shall be checked every year, using NIST or equivalent reference filters. Deviations in excess of 1 percent of the nominal opacity shall be corrected.</p>
