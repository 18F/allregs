                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Amounts to be released--(1) Dividends derived from domestic corporation. If United States tax has been withheld at the statutory rate on or after January 1, 1957, from dividends described in Sec. 514.2(a) and derived from a domestic corporation by a nonresident alien (including a nonresident alien individual, fiduciary, and partnership) or by a foreign corporation, whose address at the time of payment was in France, the withholding agent shall release and pay over to the person from whom the tax was withheld an amount which is equal to the difference between the tax so withheld and the tax required to be withheld pursuant to Sec. 514.2(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Coupon bond interest--(i) Substitute form. In the case of every taxpayer who furnishes to the withholding agent Form 1001-F clearly marked ``Substitute'' and executed in accordance with Sec. 514.4(b)(1), where United States tax has been withheld at the statutory rate on or after January 1, 1957, from coupon bond interest, the withholding agent shall release and pay over to the person from whom the tax was withheld an amount which is equal to the difference between the tax so withheld and the tax required to be withheld pursuant to Sec. 514.4(b)(1) if the taxpayer also attaches to such form a letter in duplicate, signed by the owner, trustee, or agent and containing the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The name and address of the obligor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The name and address of the owner from which the excess tax was withheld;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A statement that, at the time when the interest was derived from which the excess tax was withheld, the owner was neither a citizen nor a resident of the United States but was a resident of France, or, in the case of a corporation, the owner was a French corporation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A statement that the owner at no time during the taxable year in which the interest was derived was engaged in trade or business within the United States through a permanent establishment situated therein.
One such substitute form shall be filed, in duplicate, with respect to each issue of bonds and will serve with respect to that issue to replace all Forms 1001 previously filed by the taxpayer in the calendar year in which the excess tax was withheld and with respect to which such excess is released. If the person presenting the coupon, or on whose behalf it is presented, is not the owner of the bond, Form 1001, and not Form 1001-F, shall be executed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disposition of form. The original and duplicate of substitute Form 1001-F (and letter) shall be forwarded by the withholding agent to the Director, International Operations Division, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C., with the annual return on Form 1042. Substitute Form 1001-F need not be listed on Form 1042.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Noncoupon interest, royalties, private pensions, and life annuities. (i) If a taxpayer furnishes to the withholding agent a Form 1001A-F, properly executed as prescribed by Sec. 514.4(b)(4), and United States tax has been withheld at the statutory rate on or after January 1, 1957, from noncoupon interest payments in respect of which the form is filed, the withholding agent should release and pay over to the person from whom the tax was withheld an amount which is equal to the difference between the tax so withheld and the tax required to be withheld pursuant to Sec. 514.4(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a taxpayer furnishes to the withholding agent a Form 1001A-F, properly executed as prescribed by Sec. 514.4(b)(4), and United States tax has been withheld at the statutory rate on or after January 1, 1957, from royalties, private pensions, and life annuities in respect of which the form is filed, the withholding agent shall release and pay over to the person from whom the tax was withheld an amount which is equal to the total tax so withheld.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Amounts not to be released. The provisions of this section do not apply to excess tax withheld at source which has been paid by the withholding agent to the internal revenue officer entitled to receive payment of the tax withheld under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Statutory rate. As used in this section, the term ``statutory rate'' means the rate prescribed by chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the regulations thereunder, as though the convention had not come into effect.</p>
