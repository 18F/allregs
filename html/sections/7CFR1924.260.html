                                Sec. 1924.260  Handling manufactured housing (unit) construction complaints.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When a borrower who has purchased a manufactured home (or ``unit'')  complains about construction defects, the borrower will be instructed to  first contact the dealer-contractor from whom the unit was purchased.  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will assist the  borrower in obtaining assistance through the dealer-contractor's and/or  HUD's complaint resolution process. If the dealer-contractor cannot  resolve the complaint, the borrower should contact the appropriate State  Administrative Agency (SAA) or HUD. If the complaint resolution process  does not result in the correction of the defect, the borrower's   complaint will be handled in accordance with Sec. 1924.259 of this  subpart.</p>
