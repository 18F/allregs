The prohibition continues until the FMCSA has received full payment of the penalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Civil penalties paid in installments. The FMCSA Service Center may allow a CMV owner or operator, or an intermodal equipment provider, to pay a civil penalty in installments. If the CMV owner or operator, or intermodal equipment provider, fails to make an installment payment on schedule, the payment plan is void and the entire debt is payable immediately. A CMV owner or operator, or intermodal equipment provider, that fails to pay the full outstanding balance of its civil penalty within 90 days after the date of the missed installment payment, is prohibited from operating in interstate commerce on the next (i.e., the 91st) day. The prohibition continues until the FMCSA has received full payment of the entire penalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Appeals to Federal Court.

(1) FMCSA will notify a CMV owner or operator, or intermodal equipment provider, in writing if it has not received payment within 45 days after the date specified for payment by the final agency order or the date of a missed installment payment. The notice will include a warning that failure to pay the entire penalty within 90 days after payment was due, will result in the CMV owner or operator, or an intermodal equipment provider, being prohibited from operating in interstate commerce.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FMCSA will notify a CMV owner or operator, or intermodal equipment provider, in writing if it has not received payment within 45 days after the date specified for payment by the final agency order or the date of a missed installment payment.

The prohibition may be avoided only by submitting to the Chief Safety Officer:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evidence that the respondent has paid the entire amount due; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence that the respondent has filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11, title 11, United States Code.
