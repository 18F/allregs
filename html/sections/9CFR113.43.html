                            <p class="depth0">The test for chlamydial agents provided in this section shall be  conducted when such a test is prescribed in an applicable standard  requirement or in a filed Outline of Production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The yolk sac of 6-day-old chicken embryos shall be injected.  Three groups of 10 embryos shall be used sequentially.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The inoculum for each embryo in the first group shall consist of  0.5 ml of a mixture of equal parts of the seed virus with phosphate  buffered saline that may contain Streptomycin, Vancomycin, Kanamycin, or  a combination thereof. Not more than 2 mg/ml of each antibiotic shall be  used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On the 10th day postinoculation, the yolk sac of viable embryos  shall be harvested, pooled, homogenized as a 20 percent suspension in  phosphate buffered saline antibiotic diluent, and 0.5 ml of the mixture  injected into the second group of chicken embryos. This process shall be  repeated for the injection of the third group of embryos using the yolk  sacs of viable embryos from the second group.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each of the three passages, embryo deaths occurring within  48 hours of injection shall be disregarded, except that if more than  three such deaths occur at any passage, that passage shall be repeated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If one or more embryo deaths occur at any passage after 48 hours  postinjection, the yolk sacs from each of the dead embryos shall be  subcultured into 10 additional embryos. If one or more embryo deaths  again occur due to chlamydial agents, the Master Seed Virus is  unsatisfactory for use to produce vaccine.  [44 FR 58899, Oct. 12, 1979]</p>
