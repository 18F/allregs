Sections 76.651-76.662 apply to those programs and provide rules for that participation. These sections do not affect the authority of the State or a subgrantee to enter into a contract with a private party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If any other rules for participation of students enrolled in private schools apply under a particular program, they are in the authorizing statute or implementing regulations for that program.
(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e-3 and 3474)</p><p class="depth2">Note: Some program statutes authorize the Secretary--under certain circumstances--to provide benefits directly to private school students. These ``bypass'' provisions--where they apply--are implemented in the individual program regulations.</p>
