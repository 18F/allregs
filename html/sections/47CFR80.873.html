                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The transmitter must be capable of transmission of G3E emission  on 156.300 MHz and 156.800 MHz, and on frequencies which have been  specified for use in a system established to promote safety of  navigation. Vessels in waters of other Administrations are required to  communicate on any channel designated by that Administration for  navigational safety in the bands specified in Sec. 80.871(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The transmitter must be adjusted so that the transmission of  speech normally produces peak modulation within the limits of 75 percent  and 100 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The transmitter must deliver a carrier power between 8 and 25  watts into a 50 ohm effective resistance. Provision must be made for  reducing the   carrier power to a value between 0.1 and 1.0 watts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The transmitter complies with the power output requirements  specified in paragraph (c) of this section when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transmitter is capable of being adjusted for efficient use  with an actual ship station transmitting antenna meeting the  requirements of Sec. 80.876; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The transmitter has been demonstrated capable, with normal  operating voltages applied, of delivering not less than 8 watts of  carrier power into 50 ohms effective resistance over the frequency band  specified in Sec. 80.871(d). An individual demonstration of the power  output capability of the transmitter, with the radiotelephone  installation normally installed on board ship, may be required; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is certificated as required by subpart F of this part.
