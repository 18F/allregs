Withdrawal of an application does not  authorize the removal of any related records from the PHMSA dockets or  files. Applications that are eligible for confidential treatment under  Sec. 105.30 will remain confidential after the application is withdrawn.  The duration of this confidential treatment for trade secrets and  commercial or financial information is indefinite, unless the party  requesting the confidential treatment of the materials notifies the  Associate Administrator that the confidential treatment is no longer  required.</p>
