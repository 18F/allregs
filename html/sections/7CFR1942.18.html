                                Sec. 1942.18  Community facilities--Planning, bidding, contracting,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. This section is specifically designed for use by owners  including the professional or technical consultants and/or agents who  provide assistance and services such as architectural, engineering,  inspection, financial, legal or other services related to planning,  bidding, contracting, and constructing community facilities. These  procedures do not relieve the owner of the contractual obligations that  arise from the procurement of these services. For this section, an owner  is defined as an applicant, borrower, or grantee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Technical services. Owners are responsible for providing the  engineering or architectural services necessary for planning, designing,  bidding, contracting, inspecting, and constructing their facilities.  Services may be provided by the owner's ``in house'' engineer or  architect or through contract, subject to FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 concurrence. Architects and engineers must be  licensed in the State where the facility is to be constructed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Preliminary reports. Preliminary architectural and engineering  reports must conform with customary professional standards. Preliminary  report guidelines for water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, storm sewer,  and other essential community facilities are available from FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Design policies. Facilities financed by FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 will be designed and constructed in  accordance with sound engineering and architectural practices, and must  meet the requirements of Federal, State and local agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Natural resources. Facility planning should be responsive to the  owner's needs and should consider the long-term economic, social and  environmental needs as set forth in this section. FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354's environmental considerations are under  subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Floodplains and wetlands. Facilities must avoid, to the extent  possible, the long- and short-term adverse impacts associated with the  occupancy and modification of floodplains and wetlands, and avoid direct  or indirect support of floodplain and wetland development whenever there  is a practicable alternative. This subject is more fully discussed in  Executive Order 11988, Executive Order 11990, and Water Resources  Council's Floodplain Management Guidelines (43 FR 6030) which is  available in all FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  offices. Facilities located in special flood and mudslide prone areas  must comply with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's  eligibility and insurance requirements in subpart B of part 1806 of this  chapter (FmHA Instruction 426.2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Coastal zone management. Facilities shall be designed and  constructed in a manner consistent with approved State management  programs, under   the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-583 section 307  (c)(1) and (2)) as supplemented by the Department of Commerce  regulations 15 CFR part 930.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Wild and scenic rivers. Facilities shall be designed and  constructed in order that designated wild and scenic rivers be preserved  in free-flowing condition and that they and their immediate environments  be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future  generations under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95- 625).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Endangered species. Facilities shall be designed and  constructed in a manner to conserve, to the extent practicable, the  various endangered and threatened species of fish or wildlife and  plants, and will not jeopardize their continued existence and will not  result in destruction or modification of the habitat of species in the  Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-205).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Historic preservation. Facilities should be designed and  constructed in a manner which will contribute to the preservation and  enhancement of sites, structures, and objects of historical,  architectural, and archaeological significance. All facilities must  comply with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C  470) as supplemented by 36 CFR part 800 and Executive Order 11593,  ``Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment.'' subpart F of  part 1901 of this chapter sets forth procedures for the protection of  Historic and Archaeological Properties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Architectural barriers. All facilities intended for or  accessible to the public or in which physically handicapped persons may  be employed or reside must be developed in compliance with the  Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-480) as implemented by  the General Services Administration regulations 41 CFR 101-19.6 and  section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-112) as  implemented by 7 CFR parts 15 and 15b.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Health care facilities. The proposed facility must meet the  minimum standards for design and construction contained in the American  Institute of Architects Press Publication No. ISBN 0-913962-96-1,  ``Guidelines for Construction and Equipment of Hospital and Medical  Facilities,'' 1987 Edition. The facility must also meet the life/safety  aspects of the 1985 edition of the National Fire Protection Association  (NFPA) 101 Life Safety Code, or any subsequent code that may be  designated by the Secretary of HHS. All publications referenced in this  section are available in all FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 State Offices. Under Sec. 1942.17(j)(8)(ii) of this subpart,  a statement by the responsible regulatory agency that the facility meets  the above standards will be required. Any exceptions must have prior  National Office concurrence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Energy conservation. Facility design should consider cost  effective energy saving measures or devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Lead base paints. Lead base paints shall not be used in  facilities designed for human habitation. Owners must comply with the  Lead Base Paints Poisoning and Prevention Act of 1971 (42 U.S.C. 4801)  and the National Consumer Health Information and Health Promotion Act of  1976 (Pub. L. 94-317) with reference to paint specifications used  according to exhibit H of subpart A of part 1924 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Fire protection. Water facilities must have sufficient capacity  to provide reasonable fire protection to the extent practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Growth capacity. Facilities must have sufficient capacity to  provide for reasonable growth to the extent practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Water conservation. Owners are encouraged, when economically  feasible, to incorporate water conservation practices into a facility's  design. For existing water systems, evidence must be provided showing  that the distribution system water losses do not exceed reasonable  levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Water quality. All water facilities must meet the requirements  of the Safe Drinking Water Act (Pub. L. 93-523) and provide water of a  quality that meets the current Interim Primary Drinking Water  Regulations (40 CFR part 141).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Combined sewers. New combined sanitary and storm water sewer  facilities will not be financed by FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law   103-354. Extensions to existing combined systems can only be financed  when separate systems are impractical.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Compliance. All facilities must meet the requirements of  Federal, State, and local agencies having the appropriate jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Dam safety. Projects involving any artificial barrier which  impounds or diverts water, or the rehabilitation or improvement of such  a barrier, should comply with the provisions for dam safety as discussed  in the Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety (Government Publishing Office  stock No. 041-001-00187-5) as prepared by the Federal Coordinating  Council for Science, Engineering and Technology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Pipe. All pipe used shall meet current American Society for  Testing Materials (ASTM) or American Water Works Association (AWWA)  standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Water system testing. For new water systems or extensions to  existing water systems, leakage shall not exceed 10 gallons per inch of  pipe diameter per mile of pipe per 24 hours when tested at 1\1/2\ times  the working pressure or rated pressure of the pipe, whichever is  greater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Metering devices. Water facilities financed by FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will have metering devices for  each connection. An exception to this requirement may be granted by the  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director  when the owner demonstrates that installation of metering devices would  be a significant economic detriment and that environmental consideration  would not be adversely affected by not installing such devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Seismic safety. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All new building construction shall be  designed and constructed in accordance with the seismic provisions of  one of the following model building codes or the latest edition of that  code providing an equivalent level of safety to that contained in latest  edition of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program's (NEHRP)  Recommended Provisions for the Development of Seismic Regulations for  New Building (NEHRP Provisions):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 1991 International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO)  Uniform Building Code;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 1993 Building Officials and Code Administrators International,  Inc. (BOCA) National Building Code; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> 1992 Amendments to the Southern Building Code Congress  International (SBCCI) Standard Building Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The date, signature, and seal of a registered architect or  engineer and the identification and date of the model building code on  the plans and specifications will be evidence of compliance with the  seismic requirements of the appropriate building code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Construction contracts. Contract documents must be sufficiently  descriptive and legally binding in order to accomplish the work as  economically and expeditiously as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Standard construction contract documents are available from FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. When FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354's standard construction  contract documents are used, it will normally not be necessary for the  Office of the General Counsel (OGC) to perform a detailed legal review.  If the construction contract documents utilized are not in the format of  guide forms previously approved by FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354, OGC's review of the construction contract documents  will be obtained prior to their use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contract review and approval. The owner's attorney will review  the executed contract documents, including performance and payment  bonds, and will certify that they are adequate, and that the persons  executing these documents have been properly authorized to do so. The  contract documents, bids bonds, and bid tabulation sheets will be  forwarded to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for  approval prior to awarding. All contracts will contain a provision that  they are not in full force and effect until they have been approved by  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director or designee is  responsible for approving construction contracts with the legal advice  and guidance of the OGC when necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Separate contracts. Arrangements which split responsibility of  contractors (separate contracts for labor and material, extensive  subcontracting and multiplicity of small contracts on the same job),  should be avoided whenever it is practical to do so. Contracts may be  awarded to suppliers or manufacturers for furnishing and installing  certain items which have been designed by the manufacturer and delivered  to the job site in a finished or semifinished state such as  perfabricated buildings and lift stations. Contracts may also be awarded  for material delivered to the job site and installed by a patented  process or method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Utility purchase contracts. Applicants proposing to purchase  water or other utility service from private or public sources shall have  written contracts for supply or service which are reviewed and approved  by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State  Director or designee. To the extent practical, FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 review and approval of such contracts  should take place prior to their execution by the owner. Form FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 442-30, ``Water Purchase  Contract,'' may be used when appropriate. If the FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 loan will be repaid from system  revenues, the contract will be pledged to FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 as part of the security for the loan. Such  contracts will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Include a commitment by the supplier to furnish, at a specified  point, an adequate quantity of water or other service and provide that,  in case of shortages, all of the supplier's users will proportionately  share shortages. If it is impossible to obtain a firm commitment for  either an adequate quantity or sharing shortages proportionately, a  contract may be executed and approved provided adequate evidence is  furnished to enable FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 to make a determination that the supplier has adequate supply and/or  treatment facilities to furnish its other users and the applicant for  the foreseeable future; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The supplier is subject to regulations of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission or other Federal or State agency whose  jurisdiction can be expected to prevent unwarranted curtailment of  supply; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A suitable alternative supply could be arranged within the  repayment ability of the borrower if it should become necessary; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Prior approval is obtained from the National Office. The  following information should be submitted to the National Office:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Transmittal memorandum including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Alternative supplies considered; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recommendations and comments; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any other necessary supporting information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Copies of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Proposed letter of conditions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 442- 7, ``Operating Budget''; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 442- 3, ``Balance Sheet''; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Preliminary Engineering Report; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Proposed Contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Owner and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  engineer's comments and recommendations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Documentation and statement from the supplier that it has an  adequate supply and treatment facilities available to meet the needs of  its users and the owner for the foreseeable future.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Set out the ownership and maintenance responsibilities of the  respective parties including the master meter if a meter is installed at  the point of delivery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specify the initial rates and provide some kind of escalator  clause which will permit rates for the association to be raised or  lowered proportionately as certain specified rates for the supplier's  regular customers are raised or lowered. Provisions may be made for  altering rates in accordance with the decisions of the appropriate State  agency which may have regulatory authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Run for a period of time which is at least equal to the  repayment period of the loan. State Directors may approve contracts for  shorter periods of time if the supplier cannot legally contract for such  period, or if the owner and supplier find it impossible or impractical  to negotiate a contract for the maximum period permissible under State  law, provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The supplier is subject to regulations of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission or other Federal or State agency whose  jurisdiction can be expected to prevent unwarranted curtailment of  supply; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contract contains adequate provisions for renewal; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A determination is made that in the event the contract is  terminated, there are or will be other adequate sources available to the  owner that can feasibly be developed or purchased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Set out in detail the amount of connection or demand charges, if  any, to be made by the supplier as a condition to making the service  available to the owner. However, the payment of such charges from loan  funds shall not be approved unless FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 determines that it is more feasible and economical  for the owner to pay such a connection charge than it is for the owner  to provide the necessary supply by other means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Provide for a pledge of the contract to FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 as part of the security for the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Not contain provisions for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Construction of facilities which will be owned by the supplier.  This does not preclude the use of money paid as a connection charge for  construction to be done by the supplier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Options for the future sale or transfer. This does not preclude  an agreement recognizing that the supplier and owner may at some future  date agree to a sale of all or a portion of the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Sewage treatment and bulk water sales contracts. Owners entering  into agreements with private or public parties to treat sewage or supply  bulk water shall have written contracts for such service and all such  contracts shall be subject to FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 concurrence. Paragraph (f) of this section should be used as  a guide to prepare such contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Performing construction. Owners are encouraged to accomplish  construction through contracts with recognized contractors. Owners may  accomplish construction by using their own personnel and equipment  provided the owners possess the necessary skills, abilities and  resources to perform the work and provided a licensed engineer or  architect prepares design drawings and specifications and inspects  construction and furnishes inspection reports as required by paragraph  (o) of this section. For other than utility-type facilities, inspection  services may be provided by individuals as approved by the FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director. In either  case, the requirements of paragraph (j) of this section apply. Payments  for construction will be handled under Sec. 1942.17(p)(5) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Owner's contractual responsibility. This subpart does not  relieve the owner of any contractual responsibilities under its  contract. The owner is responsible for the settlement of all  contractural and administrative issues arising out of procurements  entered into in support of a loan or grant. These include, but are not  limited to: source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. Matters  concerning violation of laws are to be referred to the local, State, or  Federal authority as may have jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Owner's procurement regulations. Owner's procurement regulations  must comply with the following standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Code of conduct. Owners shall maintain a written code or  standards of conduct which shall govern the performance of their  officers, employees or agents engaged in the award and administration of  contracts supported by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 funds. No employee, officer or agent of the owner shall  participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract  supported by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 funds  if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Examples  of such conflicts would arise when: the employee, officer   or agent; any member of their immediate family; their partner; or an  organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of the above; has  a financial or other interest in the firm selected for the award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The owner's officers, employees or agents shall neither solicit  nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from  contractors, potential contractors, or parties of subagreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent permitted by State or local law or regulations,  the owner's standards of conduct shall provide for penalties, sanctions,  or other disciplinary actions for violations of such standards by the  owner's officers, employees, agents, or by contractors or their agents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maximum open and free competition. All procurement transactions,  regardless of whether by sealed bids or by negotiation and without  regard to dollar value, shall be conducted in a manner that provides  maximum open and free competition. Procurement procedures shall not  restrict or eliminate competition. Examples of what are considered to be  restrictive of competition include, but are not limited to: Placing  unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do  business; noncompetitive practices between firms; organizational  conflicts of interest; and unnecessary experience and bonding  requirements. In specifying material(s), the owner and its consultant  will consider all materials normally suitable for the project  commensurate with sound engineering practices and project requirements.  For a water or waste disposal facility, FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 shall consider fully any recommendation made by  the loan applicant or borrower concerning the technical design and  choice of materials to be used for such a facility. If FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 determines that a design or  material, other than those that were recommended should be considered by  including them in the procurement process as an acceptable design or  material in the water or waste disposal facility, FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 shall provide such applicant or borrower  with a comprehensive justification for such a determination. The  justification will be documented in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Owner's review. Proposed procurement actions shall be reviewed  by the owner's officials to avoid the purchase of unnecessary or  duplicate items. Consideration should be given to consolidation or  separation of procurement items to obtain a more economical purchase.  Where appropriate, an analysis shall be made of lease versus purchase  alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine which  approach would be the most economical. To foster greater economy and  efficiency, owners are encouraged to enter into State and local  intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and  services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Solicitation of offers, whether by competitive sealed bids or  competitive negotiation, shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical  requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. The  description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features  which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a  statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service  to be procured, and when necessary shall set forth those minimum  essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it  is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should  be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to  make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a  ``brand name or equal'' description may be used to define the  performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific  features of the named brands which must be met by offerors shall be  clearly stated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Clearly specify all requirements which offerors must fulfill  and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Small, minority, and women's businesses and labor surplus area  firms. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> affirmative steps should be taken to assure that small and  minority businesses are utilized when possible as   sources of supplies, equipment, construction and services. Affirmative  steps shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Include qualified small and minority businesses on solicitation  lists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Assure that small and minority businesses are solicited whenever  they are potential sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When economically feasible, divide total requirements into  smaller tasks or quantities so as to permit maximum small and minority  business participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Where the requirement permits, establish delivery schedules  which will encourage participation by small and minority businesses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Use the services and assistance of the Small Business  Administration and the Office of Minority Business Enterprise of the  Department of Commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If any subcontracts are to be let, require the prime contractor  to take the affirmative steps in paragraphs (j)(5)(i) (A) through (E) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Owners shall take similar appropriate affirmative action in  support of women's businesses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Owners are encouraged to procure goods and services from labor  surplus areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Owners shall submit a written statement or other evidence to  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of the steps taken  to comply with paragraphs (j)(5)(i) (A) through (F), (j)(5)(ii), and  (j)(5)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Contract pricing. Cost plus a percentage of cost method of  contracting shall not be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Unacceptable bidders. The following will not be allowed to bid  on, or negotiate for, a contract or subcontract related to the  construction of the project:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An engineer or architect as an individual or firm who has  prepared plans and specifications or who will be responsible for  monitoring the construction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any firm or corporation in which the owner's architect or  engineer is an officer, employee, or holds or controls a substantial  interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The governing body's officers, employees, or agents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any member of the immediate family or partners in paragraphs  (j)(7)(i), (j)(7)(ii), or (j)(7)(iii) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any person  in paragraph (j)(7)(i), (j)(7)(ii), (j)(7)(iii) or (j)(7)(iv) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Contract award. Contracts shall be made only with responsible  parties possessing the potential ability to perform successfully under  the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration shall  include but not be limited to matters such as integrity, record of past  performance, financial and technical resources, and accessibility to  other necessary resources. Contracts shall not be made with parties who  are suspended or debarred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Procurement methods. Procurement shall be made by one of the  following methods: small purchase procedures; competitive sealed bids  (formal advertising); competitive negotiation; or noncompetitive  negotiation. Competitive sealed bids (formal advertising) is the  preferred procurement method for construction contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Small purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those  relatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing  services, supplies or other property, costing in the aggregate not more  than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. If small purchase procedures  are used for a procurement, written price or rate quotations shall be  obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Competitive sealed bids. In competitive sealed bids (formal  advertising), sealed bids are publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price  contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder  whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the  invitation for bids, is lowest, price and other factors considered. When  using this method the following shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At a sufficient time prior to the date set for opening of bids,  bids shall be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources. In  addition, the invitation shall be publicly advertised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The invitation for bids, including specifications and perinent  attachments, shall clearly define the items or services needed in order  for the bidders   to properly respond to the invitation under paragraph (j)(4) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place stated  in the invitation for bids.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A firm-fixed-price contract award shall be made by written  notice to that responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the  invitation for bids, is lowest. When specified in the bidding documents,  factors such as discounts and transportation costs shall be considered  in determining which bid is lowest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Any or all bids may be rejected by the owner when it is in their  best interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Competitive negotiation. In competitive negotiations, proposals  are requested from a number of sources and the Request for Proposal is  publicized. Negotiations are normally conducted with more than one of  the sources submitting offers. Competitive negotiation may be used if  conditions are not appropriate for the use of formal advertising and  where discussions and bargaining with a view to reaching agreement on  the technical quality, price, other terms of the proposed contract and  specifications may be necessary. If competitive negotiation is used for  a procurement, the following requirements shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Proposals shall be solicited from an adequate number of  qualified sources to permit reasonable competition consistent with the  nature and requirements of the procurement. The Request for Proposal  shall be publicized and reasonable requests by other sources to compete  shall be honored to the maximum extent practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Request for Proposal shall identify all significant  evaluation factors, including price or cost where required, and their  relative importance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The owner shall provide mechanisms for technical evaluation of  the proposals received, determination of responsible offerors for the  purpose of written or oral discussions, and selection for contract  award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Award may be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal  will be most advantageous to the owner, price and other factors  considered. Unsuccessful offerors should be promptly notified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Owners may utilize competitive negotiation procedures for  procurement of architectural/engineering and other professional  services, whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated and the most  qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiations of fair and  reasonable compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Noncompetitive negotiation. Noncompetitive negotiation is  procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or  after solicitation of a number of sources competition is determined  inadequate. Noncompetitive negotiation may be used when the award of a  contract is not feasible under small purchase, competitive sealed bids  (formal advertising) or competitive negotiation procedures.  Circumstances under which a contract may be awarded by noncompetitive  negotiations are limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The item is available only from a single source; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There exists a public exigency or emergency and the urgency for  the requirement will not permit a delay incident to competitive  solicitation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is  determined inadequate; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> No acceptable bids have been received after formal advertising;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The procurement of architectural/engineering and other  professional services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The aggregate amount does not exceed $50,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Additional procurement methods. Additional innovative  procurement methods may be used by the owner with prior written approval  of the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 National  Office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Alternate contracting methods. The services of the consulting  engineer or architect and the general construction contractor shall  normally be procured from unrelated sources in accordance with paragraph  (j)(7) of this section. Alternate contracting methods which combine or  rearrange design, inspection or construction services (such as design/ build or construction management/constructor) may be used with Rural  Development written approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owner will request Rural Development approval by providing  the following information to the State Office for review and approval by  the State Architect:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The owner's written request to use an unconventional contracting  method with a description of the proposed method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A proposed scope of work describing in clear, concise terms the  technical requirements for the contract. This would include a  nontechnical statement summarizing the work to be performed by the  contractor, the expected results, the sequence in which the work is to  be performed, and a proposed construction schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A proposed firm-fixed-price contract for the entire project  which provides that the contractor shall be responsible for any extra  cost which may result from errors or omissions in the services provided  under the contract and compliance with all Federal, State, and local  requirements effective on the contract execution date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An evaluation of the contractor's performance on previous  similar projects in which the contractor acted in a similar capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A detailed listing and cost estimate of equipment and supplies  not included in the construction contract but which are necessary to  properly operate the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Evidence that a qualified construction inspector who is  independent of the contractor has or will be hired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Preliminary plans and outline specifications. However, final  plans and specifications must be completed and reviewed by Rural  Development prior to the start of construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The owner's attorney's opinion and comments regarding the  legal adequacy of the proposed contract documents and evidence that the  owner has the legal authority to enter into and fulfill the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State Office may approve design/build or construction  management/constructor projects if the contract amount is equal to or  less than $250,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the contract amount exceeds $250,000, National Office prior  concurrence must be obtained in accordance with Sec. 1942.9(b) of this  subpart. Additional information, such as plans and specifications, may  be requested by the National Office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Design/Build method of construction is one in which the  architectural and engineering services, normally provided by an  independent consultant to the owner, are combined with those of the  General Contractor under a single source contract. These services are  commonly provided by a Design/Build firm, a joint venture between an  architectural firm and a construction firm, or a company providing pre- engineered buildings and design services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The Construction Management/constructor (CMc), acts in the  capacity of a General Contractor and is actually responsible for the  construction. This type of construction management is also referred to  as Construction Manager ``At Risk.'' The construction contract is  between the owner and the CMc. The CMc, in turn, may subcontract for  some or all of the work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The National Office may approve other alternative contact  methods, such as Construction Management/advisor (CMa), with a  recommendation from the State Office. The recommendation shall indicate  the circumstances which prove this method advantageous to the applicant  and the Government. A CMa acts in an advisory capacity to the owner, and  the actual contract for construction is between the owner and a prime  contractor or multiple prime contractors. When a contract for an  architect and a CMa are being provided, it is important to make sure  that separate professionals are not being paid to provide similar  services. Further, paragraph (e)(3) of this section discourages separate  contracts for construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> All alternate contracting method projects must comply with the  requirements for ``maximum open and free competition'' in paragraph  (j)(2) of this section. Choosing an alternate contracting method is not  a way to avoid competition. Further information on procurement methods,  which must be followed, is provided in paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Contracts awarded prior to preapplications. Owners awarding  construction or other procurement contracts prior to filing a pre- application with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  must comply with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Evidence. Provide conclusive evidence that the contract was  entered into without intent to circumvent the requirements of FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations. The evidence  will consist of at least the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The lapse of a reasonable period of time between the date of  contract award and the date of filing the preapplication which clearly  indicates an irreconcilable failure of previous financial arrangements;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A written statement explaining initial plans for financing the  project and reasons for failure to obtain the planned credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Modifications. Modify the outstanding contract to conform with  the provisions of this subpart. Where this is not possible,  modifications will be made to the extent practicable and, as a minimum,  the contract must comply with all State and local laws and regulations  as well as statutory requirements and executive orders related to the  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 financing. When  all construction is complete and it is impracticable to modify the  contracts, the owner must provide the certification required by  paragraph (m)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consultant's certification. Provide a certification by an  engineer or architect that any construction performed complies fully  with the plans and specifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Owner's certification. Provide a certification by the owner that  the contractor has complied with all statutory and executive  requirements related to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 financing for construction already performed even though the  requirements may not have been included in the contract documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Contract provisions. In addition to provisions defining a sound  and complete contract, any recipient of FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 funds shall include the following contract  provisions or conditions in all contracts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Remedies. Contracts other than small purchases shall contain  provisions or conditions which will allow for administrative,  contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or  breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as  may be appropriate. A realistic liquidated damage provision should also  be included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Termination. All contracts exceeding $10,000, shall contain  provisions for termination by the owner including the manner by which it  will be affected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such  contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be  terminated for default as well as conditions when the contract may be  terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the  contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Surety. In all contracts for construction or facility  improvements awarded exceeding $100,000, the owner shall require bonds,  a bank letter of credit or cash deposit in escrow assuring performance  and payment, each in the amount of 100 percent of the contract cost. The  surety will normally be in the form of performance bonds and payment  bonds; however, when other methods of surety may be necessary, bid  documents must contain provisions for such alternative types of surety.  The use of surety other than performance bonds and payment bonds  requires concurrence by the National Office after submission of a  justification by the State Director together with the proposed form of  escrow agreement or letter of credit. For contracts of lesser amounts,  the owner may require surety. When a surety is not provided, contractors  will furnish evidence of payment in full for all materials, labor, and  any other items procured under the contract. Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-10, ``Release by Claimants,'' and  Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-9,  ``Certificate of Contractor's Release,'' may be obtained at the local  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office and used  for this purpose. The United States, acting through the   Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354, will be named as co-obligee on all surety unless prohibited by  State law. Companies providing performance bonds and payment bonds must  hold a certificate of authority as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds  as listed in Treasury Circular 570 as amended and be legally doing  business in the State where the facility is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Equal Employment Opportunity. All contracts awarded in excess of  $10,000 by owners shall contain a provision requiring compliance with  Executive Order 11246, entitled, ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as  amended by Executive Order 11375, and as supplemented by Department of  Labor regulations 41 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Anti-kickback. All contracts for construction shall include a  provision for compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18  U.S.C. 874). This Act provides that each contractor shall be prohibited  from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction,  completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part of the  compensation to which they are otherwise entitled. The owner shall  report all suspected or reported violations to FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Records. All negotiated contracts (except those of $2,500 or  less) awarded by owners shall include a provision to the effect that the  owner, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, the  Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly  authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents,  papers, and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a  specific Federal loan program for the purpose of making audits,  examinations, excerpts, and transcriptions. Owners shall require  contractors to maintain all required records for three years after  owners make final payments and all other pending matters are closed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> State Energy Conservation Plan. Contracts shall recognize  mandatory standards and policies relating to energy efficiency which are  contained in the State energy conservation plan issued in compliance  with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (Pub. L. 94-163).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Change orders. The construction contract shall require that all  contract change orders be approved in writing by FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  concurrence. All contracts must contain a provision that they shall not  be effective unless and until the FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 State Director or designee concurs in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Retainage. All construction contracts shall contain adequate  provisions for retainage. No payments will be made that would deplete  the retainage nor place in escrow any funds that are required for  retainage nor invest the retainage for the benefit of the contractor.  The retainage shall not be less than an amount equal to 10 percent of an  approved partial payment estimate until 50 percent of the work has been  completed. If the job is proceeding satisfactory at 50 percent  completion, further partial payments may be made in full, however,  previously retained amounts shall not be paid until construction is  substantially complete. Additional amounts may be retained if the job is  not proceeding satisfactorily, but in no event shall the total retainage  be more than 10 percent of the value of the work completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Other compliance requirements. Contracts in excess of $100,000  shall contain a provision which requires compliance with all applicable  standards, orders, or requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean  Air Act (42 U.S.C. 1857(h)), section 508 of the Clean Water Act (33  U.S.C. 1368), Executive Order 11738, and Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) regulations 40 CFR part 15, which prohibit the use under non- exempt Federal contracts, grants or loans of facilities included on the  EPA List of Violating Facilities. The provision shall require reporting  of violations to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  and to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Assistant Administrator  for Enforcement. Solicitations and contract provisions shall include the  requirements of 40 CFR part 15.4(c) as set forth in guide 18 of this  subpart which   is available in all FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 offices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Contract administration. Owners shall be responsible for  maintaining a contract administration system to monitor the contractors'  performance and compliance with the terms, conditions, and  specifications of the contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Preconstruction conference. Prior to beginning construction, the  owner will schedule a preconstruction conference where FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will review the planned  development with the owner, its architect or engineer, resident  inspector, attorney, contractor(s), and other interested parties. The  conference will thoroughly cover applicable items included in Form FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-16, ``Record of  Preconstruction Conference,'' and the discussion and agreements will be  documented. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  1924-16 may be used for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Monitoring reports. Each owner will be required to monitor and  provide reports to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  on actual performance during construction for each project financed, or  to be financed, in whole or in part with FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 funds to include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A comparison of actual accomplishments with the construction  schedule established for the period. The partial payment estimate may be  used for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A narrative statement giving full explanation of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Reasons why established goals were not met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs and  how payment is to be made for the same.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If events occur between reports which have a significant  impact upon the project, the owner will notify FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 as soon as any of the following  conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially  affect the ability to attain program objectives or prevent the meeting  of project work units by established time periods. This disclosure shall  be accompanied by a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and  any Federal assistance needed to resolve the situation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Favorable developments or events which enable meeting time  schedules and goals sooner than anticipated or producing more work units  than originally projected or which will result in cost underruns or  lower unit costs than originally planned and which may result in less  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Inspection. Full-time resident inspection is required for all  construction unless a written exception is made by FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 upon written request of the owner.  Unless otherwise agreed, the resident inspector will be provided by the  consulting architect/engineer. Prior to the preconstruction conference,  the architect/engineer will submit a resume of qualifications of the  resident inspector to the owner and to FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 for acceptance in writing. If the owner  provides the resident inspector, it must submit a resume of the  inspector's qualifications to the project architect/engineer and FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for acceptance in writing  prior to the preconstruction conference. The resident inspector will  work under the general supervision of the project architect/engineer. A  guide format for preparing daily inspection reports (Guide 11 of this  subpart) and Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  1924-18, ``Partial Payment Estimate,'' are available on request from  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Inspector's daily diary. The resident inspector will maintain a  record of the daily construction progress in the form of a daily diary  and daily inspection reports as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A complete set of all daily construction records will be  maintained and the original set furnished to the owner upon completion  of construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All entries shall be legible and shall be made in ink.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Daily entries shall include but not be limited to the date,  weather conditions, number and classification of personnel working on  the site, equipment being used to perform the work, persons visiting the  site, accounts of substantive discussions, instructions given to the  contractors, directions received, all significant or unusual happenings  involving the work, any delays, and daily work accomplished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The daily entries shall be made available to FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 personnel and will be reviewed  during project inspections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Prefinal inspections. A prefinal inspection will be made by the  owner, resident inspector, project architect or engineer,  representatives of other agencies involved, the District Director and a  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office staff  representative, preferably the State Staff architect or engineer.  Prefinal inspections may be made without FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 State Office staff participation if the State  Director or a designee determines that the facility does not utilize  complicated construction techniques, materials or equipment for  facilities such as small fire stations, storage buildings or minor  utility extensions, and that an experienced District Office staff  representative will be present. The inspection results will be recorded  on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-12,  ``Inspection Report,'' and a copy provided to all appropriate parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Final inspection. A final inspection will be made by FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 before final payment is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Change is development plans. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Changes in development plans  may be approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  when requested by owners, provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Funds are available to cover any additional costs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The change is for an authorized loan purpose; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> It will not adversely affect the soundness of the facility  operation or FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's  security; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The change is within the scope of the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Changes will be recorded on Form FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 1924-7, ``Contract Change Order,'' or, other  similar forms may be used with the prior approval of the State Director  or designee. Regardless of the form, change orders must be approved by  the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director  or a designated representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Changes should be accomplished only after FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approval on all changes which  affect the work and shall be authorized only by means of contract change  order. The change order will include items such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any changes in labor and material and their respective cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Changes in facility design.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any decrease or increase in quantities based on final  measurements that are different from those shown in the bidding  schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any increase or decrease in the time to complete the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> All changes shall be recorded on chronologically numbered  contract change orders as they occur. Change orders will not be included  in payment estimates until approved by all parties.
