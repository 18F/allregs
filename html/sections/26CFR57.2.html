The designated entity must state under penalties of perjury that all persons that provide health insurance for United States health risks that are members of the group have consented to the selection of the designated entity. Each member of a controlled group must maintain a record of its consent to the controlled group's selection of the designated entity.

For this purpose, MLR rebates are computed on an accrual basis in determining net premiums written.

For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an entity must use the same test year as it used in its first fee year beginning after December 31, 2014, and in each subsequent fee year.
