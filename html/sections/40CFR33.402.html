                            <p class="depth0">A recipient of an EPA financial assistance agreement to capitalize  revolving loan funds must either apply its own fair share objectives  negotiated with EPA under Sec. 33.401 to identified loans using a  substantially similar relevant geographic market, or negotiate separate  fair share objectives with entities receiving identified loans, as long  as such separate objectives are based on demonstrable evidence of  availability of MBEs and WBEs in accordance with this subpart. If  procurements will occur over more than one year, the recipient may  choose to apply the fair share objective in place either for the year in  which the identified loan is awarded or for the year in which the  procurement action occurs. The recipient must specify this choice in the  financial assistance agreement, or incorporate it by reference therein.</p>
