                            <p class="depth0">The Act's individual employee coverage is not limited to employees  working on an hourly wage. The requirements of section 6 as to minimum  wages are that ``each'' employee described therein shall be paid wages  at a rate not less than a specified rate ``an hour''. \15\ This does not  mean that employees cannot be paid on a piecework basis or on a salary,  commission, or other basis; it merely means that whatever the basis on  which the workers are paid, whether it be monthly, weekly, or on a  piecework basis, they must receive at least the equivalent of the  minimum hourly rate. ``Each'' and ``any'' employee obviously and  necessarily includes one compensated by a unit of time, by the piece, or  by any other measurement. \16\ Regulations prescribed by the  Administrator (part 516 of this chapter) provide for the keeping of  records in such form as to enable compensation on a piecework or other  basis to be translated into an hourly rate. \17\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\15\ Special exceptions are made for Puerto Rico, the Virgin  Islands, and American Samoa.</p><p class="depth0">\16\ United States v. Rosenwasser, 323 U.S. 360.</p><p class="depth0">\17\ For methods of translating other forms of compensation into an  hourly rate for purposes of sections 6 and 7, see parts 531 and 778 of  this chapter.
