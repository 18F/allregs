                                Sec. 14.15  Committees working under a contract with FDA.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> FDA may enter into contracts with independent scientific or  technical organizations to obtain advice and recommendations on  particular matters, and these organizations may in turn undertake such  work through existing or new committees. Whether a particular committee  working under such a contract is an advisory committee subject to the  Federal Advisory Committee Act and this subpart depends upon application  of the criteria and principles in Sec. 14.1(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following minimum standards apply to any committee of an  independent scientific or technical organization which is working under  a contract initially executed with FDA after July 1, 1975, but which is  determined not to be an advisory committee:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The committee shall give public notice of its meetings and  agenda, and provide interested persons an opportunity to submit relevant  information and views in writing at any time, and orally at specified  times. The notice may be published in the Federal Register or  disseminated by other reasonable means. It is in any event to be filed  with the Division of Dockets Management not less than 15 days before the  meeting. The time for oral presentations and the extent to which the  committee meets in open session other than for such oral presentations  is in the discretion of the committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Minutes of open sessions are to be maintained, with all written  submissions attached which were made to the committee in open session.  After approval, the minutes are to be forwarded to the Division of  Dockets Management and placed on public display. The extent to which the  committee maintains minutes of closed sessions is in the discretion of  the committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In selecting the members of the committee, the organization  involved is to apply the principles relating to conflicts of interest  that FDA uses in establishing a public advisory committee. Those  principles are set out or cross-referenced in this part and in part 19.  Upon request, FDA will assist or provide guidance to any organization in  meeting this requirement.</p>
