                            <p class="depth0">In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements of  part 785 and assigned it control number 1029-0040. The information is  being collected to meet the requirements of sections 507, 508, 510, 515,  701 and 711 of Public Law 95-87, which requires applicants for special  types of mining activities to provide descriptions, maps,   plans and data of the proposed activity. This information will be used  by the regulatory authority in determining if the applicant can meet the  applicable performance standards for the special type of mining  activity. Persons must respond to obtain a benefit. A Federal agency may  not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a  collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB  control number.
