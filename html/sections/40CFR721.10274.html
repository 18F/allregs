The requirements of this rule do not apply to  quantities of the PMN substance after it has been completely reacted  (cured); embedded or incorporated into a polymer matrix that itself has  been reacted (cured); or embedded in a permanent solid polymer form with  a concentration of the PMN substance equal to or below 30 percent that  is not intended to undergo further processing except for mechanical  processing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The significant new uses are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>, (a)(2)(ii), (a)(3), (a)(4), and (c). When  determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as  required for Sec. 721.63(a)(1) and (a)(4), engineering control measures  (e.g., physical containment, exhaust control ventilation, or isolation)  or administrative control measures (e.g., workplace policies and  procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure,  where feasible. The following National Institute for Occupational Safety  and Health (NIOSH)-certified respirator meets the minimum requirements  for Sec. 721.63(a)(4): NIOSH-certified air-purifying, tight-fitting  full-face respirator equipped with N-100, P-100, or R-100 filter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.
