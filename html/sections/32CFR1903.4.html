Provided, however, that if the applicable State law that applies to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol establishes more restrictive limits of alcohol concentration in the operator's blood or breath, those limits supersede the limits specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The provisions or paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall also apply to an operator who is or has been legally entitled to use alcohol or another drug.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Test.

If the alcohol concentration in the operator's blood or breath at the time of the testing is less than the alcohol concentration specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section this fact does not give rise to any presumption that the operator is or is not under the influence of alcohol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section are not intended to limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether the operator, at the time of the alleged violation, was under the influence of alcohol, a drug or drugs, or a controlled substance, or any combination thereof.
