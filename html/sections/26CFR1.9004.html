Sec. 1.9004-1  Election relating to the determination of gross incomefrom the property for taxable years beginning prior to 1961 in thecase of certain clays and shale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The Act of September 26, 1961 (Pub. L. 87-312, 75 Stat. 674), provides that certain taxpayers may elect to apply the provisions thereof to all taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, with respect to which the election is effective. The Act prescribes special rules for the application of section 613 (a) and (c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) in the case of shale and certain clays used by the mine owner or operator in the manufacture of certain clay and shale products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Election. The election to apply the provisions of the Act may be made only by a mine owner or operator with respect to brick and tile clay, fire clay, or shale which he mined and used in the manufacture of building or paving brick, drainage and roofing tile, sewer pipe, flower pots, and kindred products. The election must be made in accordance with Sec. 1.9004-4 on or before December 11, 1961, and the election shall become irrevocable on December 11, 1961.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Years to which the election is applicable. If the election described in paragraph (b) of this section is made by the taxpayer, the provisions of the Act shall be effective for all taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, in respect of which the:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assessment of a deficiency,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Refund or credit of an overpayment, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Commencement of a suit for recovery of a refund under section 7405 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,

is not prevented on September 26, 1961, by the operation of any law or rule of law. The election is also effective for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1961, in respect of which an assessment of a deficiency has been made but not collected on or before September 26, 1961.

Sec. 1.9004-2  Effect of election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a taxpayer makes the election described in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.9004-1, he shall be deemed to have consented to the application of the Act with respect to all the clay and shale described in that paragraph for all taxable years for which the election is effective whether or not the taxpayer is litigating the issue for any of such years. Thus, in applying section 613 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) to those years:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The ``gross income from the property'' for purposes of section 613(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) shall be 50 percent of the amount for which the mineowner or operator sold, during the taxable year, the building or paving brick, drainage and roofing tile, sewer pipe, flower pots, and kindred products manufactured from the clay and shale described in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.9004-1, but shall not exceed an amount equal to $12.50 multiplied by the number of short tons of all such clay or shale mined and used by the mineowner or operator in the manufacture of the products sold during the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The ``taxable income from the property'' (computed without allowance for depletion) for purposes of section 613(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) shall be 50 percent of the taxable income from the manufactured products sold during the taxable year (computed without allowance for depletion).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effect on depletion rates and other items. The election shall have no effect on the applicable rate of percentage depletion for the taxable years to which the election is effective. In applying the election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the election shall have on other items

affected thereby, such as charitable contributions, foreign tax credit, net operating loss, and the effect that adjustments to any such items shall have on other taxable years. The provisions of the Act are applicable with respect to taxable years subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for purposes of applying sections 450 and 453 of that Code.

Sec. 1.9004-3  Statutes of limitation.</p><p class="depth0">The period within which the assessment of any deficiency or the credit or refund of any overpayment attributable to the election may be made shall not expire sooner than one year after December 11, 1961. Thus, if assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment, whichever is applicable, is not prevented on September 26, 1961, the time for making assessment or credit or refund shall not expire for at least one year after December 11, 1961, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary. Even though assessment of a deficiency is prevented on September 26, 1961, if commencement of a suit for recovery of a refund under section 7405 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 may be made on such date, then any deficiency resulting from the election may be assessed at any time within 1 year after December 11, 1961. If a taxpayer makes the election, he shall be deemed to have consented to the application of the provisions of the Act extending the time for assessing a deficiency attributable to the election. The Act does not shorten the periods of limitation otherwise applicable. An agreement may be entered into under section 6501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and corresponding provisions of prior law to extend the period for assessment.

Sec. 1.9004-4  Manner of exercising election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> By whom election is to be made. Generally, the taxpayer whose tax liability is affected by the election shall make the election. In the case of a partnership, or a corporation electing under the provisions of subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the election shall be exercised by the partnership or such corporation, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time and manner of making election. The election shall be made on or before December 11, 1961, by filing a statement with the district director with whom the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is made is required to be filed. The statement shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A clear indication that an election is being made under the Act, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The taxable years to which the election applies.

Amended income tax returns reflecting any increase or decrease in tax attributable to the election shall be filed for the taxable years to which the election applies. In the case of partnerships and electing small business corporations under subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, amended returns shall be filed by the partnership or electing small business corporation, as well as by the partners or shareholders, as the case may be. Any amended return shall be filed with the office of the district director with whom the taxpayer files his income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is made and, if practicable, on the same date the statement of election is filed, but amended returns shall be filed in no event later than March 31, 1962, unless an extension of time is granted under section 6081 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Whenever the amended returns do not accompany the statement of election, a copy of the statement shall be submitted with the amended returns. The amended returns shall be accompanied by payment of the additional tax (together with interest thereon) resulting from the election.
