Promptly after inspection and certification, each such handler shall submit, or cause to be submitted, to the committee a copy of the certificate of inspection issued with respect to such apricots. The committee may, with the approval of the Secretary, prescribe rules and regulations modifying the inspection requirements of this section as to time and place such inspection shall be performed whenever it is determined it would not be practical to perform the required inspection at a particular location: Provided, That all such shipments shall comply with all regulations in effect.
