                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This provision will be applied only at locations where a  congressionally authorized study is underway or where the study report  has been forwarded for Executive Branch review or for consideration by  Congress. If a study is underway, the District Engineer must have held  the final public meeting and filed a draft EIS with CEQ prior to  certification. Certification will be in response to a specific request  from a State, city, municipality or public agency that is the  prospective local sponsoring agency for the contemplated Federal plan  under study.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Work eligible for certification shall be limited to that part of  the local improvement directly related to a flood control purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Only local work commenced after certification shall be eligible  for certification except for local engineering work noted below in  Sec. 276.6(e). The work proposed for certification must meet the  following requirements: The work will be separately useful even if the  Federal Government does not authorize and construct the contemplated  project; the work to be accomplished by the non-Federal entity will not  create a potential hazard; certification of the proposal will be in the  general public interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Costs assigned to that part of the local improvement that would  constitute an integral part of the prospective recommended Federal plan  can be included for credit toward required local cooperation. The amount  creditable shall equal the expenditures made by the non-Federal entity  for work that would have been accomplished at Federal expense if the  entire project were carried out by the Corps of Engineers. However,  credit will not exceed the amount the District Engineer considers a  reasonable estimate of the reduction in Federal expenditures resulting  from the local work. Costs of subsequent maintenance will not be  credited. In the event that the local construction work is financed by a  Federal non-reimbursable grant or Federal funds from other Federal  sources, the amount creditable against future local cooperation  requirements shall be reduced by a commensurate amount. However, there  will be no corresponding reduction in the benefits credited for the  local improvement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Local interests are responsible for developing all necessary  engineering plans and specifications for the work they propose to  undertake. However, those non-Federal engineering costs and overhead  costs directly attributable to the creditable part of local work may be  included in the amount credited.</p>
