                            <p class="depth0">Any bank holding a note secured by an Adjusted Service Certificate  may sell the note to any bank authorized to make a loan to a veteran and  deliver the certificate to such bank. In case a note secured by an  Adjusted Service Certificate is sold or transferred, the bank selling,  discounting or rediscounting the note is required by law to notify the  veteran promptly by mail at his last known post office address. No  Adjusted Service Certificate is negotiable or assignable, or may serve  as security for a loan, except as provided in section 502 of the World  War Adjusted Compensation Act, as amended. Any negotiation, assignment  or loan made in violation of section 502 of the World War Adjusted  Compensation Act is void. In case of sale, discount or rediscount by the  bank which made the loan, the note or notes should be accompanied by the  affidavit required by Sec.  11.85.</p>
