Payments made under reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangements that meet the requirements of section 62(c) of the Code and Sec. 1.62-2, that do not exceed the amount of the expenses substantiated (i.e., amounts which are treated as paid under an accountable plan), and that are received by an employee on or after January 1, 1989, with respect to expenses paid or incurred on or after January 1, 1989.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

In general, compliance with the provisions of this section, as in effect for payments made under reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangements that were received by an employee before January 1, 1989, with respect to expenses paid or incurred before January 1, 1989, will constitute such reasonable good faith compliance. In no event, however, will reasonable good faith compliance exist if a payor fails to report payments made under an arrangement (other than a per diem or mileage allowance type arrangement) under which an employee is not required to substantiate expenses paid or incurred or is not required to return amounts in excess of the substantiated expenses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Payments of interest on obligations of the United States, or a State, Territory, or political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing (but for requirements for reporting certain such payments by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, see Sec.
