                            <p class="depth0">In evaluating whether a particular discharge site may be specified, the permitting authority should use these Guidelines in the following sequence:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In order to obtain an overview of the principal regulatory provisions of the Guidelines, review the restrictions on discharge in Sec. 230.10(a) through (d), the measures to mimimize adverse impact of subpart H, and the required factual determinations of Sec. 230.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determine if a General permit (Sec. 230.7) is applicable; if so, the applicant needs merely to comply with its terms, and no further action by the permitting authority is necessary. Special conditions for evaluation of proposed General permits are contained in Sec. 230.7. If the discharge is not covered by a General permit:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examine practicable alternatives to the proposed discharge, that is, not discharging into the waters of the U.S. or discharging into an alternative aquatic site with potentially less damaging consequences (Sec. 230.10(a)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Delineate the candidate disposal site consistent with the criteria and evaluations of Sec. 230.11(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Evaluate the various physical and chemical components which characterize the non-living environment of the candidate site, the substrate and the water including its dynamic characteristics (subpart C).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Identify and evaluate any special or critical characteristics of the candidate disposal site, and surrounding areas which might be affected by use of such site, related to their living communities or human uses (subparts D, E, and F).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Review Factual Determinations in Sec. 230.11 to determine whether the information in the project file is sufficient to provide the documentation required by Sec. 230.11 or to perform the pre-testing evaluation described in Sec. 230.60, or other information is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Evaluate the material to be discharged to determine the possibility of chemical contamination or physical incompatibility of the material to be discharged (Sec. 230.60).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> If there is a reasonable probability of chemical contamination, conduct the appropriate tests according to the section on Evaluation and Testing (Sec. 230.61).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Identify appropriate and practicable changes to the project plan to minimize the environmental impact of the discharge, based upon the specialized methods of minimization of impacts in subpart H.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Make and document Factual Determinations in Sec. 230.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Make and document Findings of Compliance (Sec. 230.12) by comparing Factual Determinations with the requirements for discharge of Sec. 230.10.
This outline of the steps to follow in using the Guidelines is simplified for purposes of illustration. The actual process followed may be iterative, with the results of one step leading to a reexamination of previous steps. The permitting authority must address all of the relevant provisions of the Guidelines in reaching a Finding of Compliance in an individual case.</p>
