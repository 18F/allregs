                            <p class="depth0">The National Practitioner Data Bank, authorized by the Act and administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, was established for the purpose of collecting and releasing certain information concerning physicians, dentists, and other health care practitioners. The Act mandates that the Department of Health and Human Services seek to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the purpose of having VA participate in the National Practitioner Data Bank. Such a Memorandum of Understanding has been established. Pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding, VA will obtain information from the Data Bank concerning physicians, dentists, and other health care practitioners who provide or seek to provide health care services at VA facilities and also report information regarding malpractice payments and adverse clinical privileges actions to the Data Bank. This part essentially restates or interprets provisions of that Memorandum of Understanding and constitutes the policy of VA for participation in the National Practitioner Data Bank.</p>
