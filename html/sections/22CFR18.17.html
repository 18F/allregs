Copies of such written interrogatories shall be served  upon the other party with the notice, and copies of any written cross- interrogation shall be mailed or delivered to the opposing party at  least 5 days before the date of taking the depositions, unless the  parties mutually agree otherwise. Expenses in the reporting of  depositions shall be borne by the party at whose instance the deposition  is taken.</p>
