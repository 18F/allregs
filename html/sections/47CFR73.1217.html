                            <p class="depth0">No licensee or permittee of any broadcast station shall broadcast  false information concerning a crime or a catastrophe if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The licensee knows this information is false;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is forseeable that broadcast of the information will cause  substantial public harm, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Broadcast of the information does in fact directly cause  substantial public harm.   Any programming accompanied by a disclaimer will be presumed not to pose  foreseeable harm if the disclaimer clearly characterizes the program as  a fiction and is presented in a way that is reasonable under the  circumstances.</p><p class="depth2">Note: For purposes of this rule, ``public harm'' must begin  immediately, and cause direct and actual damage to property or to the  health or safety of the general public, or diversion of law enforcement  or other public health and safety authorities from their duties. The  public harm will be deemed foreseeable if the licensee could expect with  a significant degree of certainty that public harm would occur. A  ``crime'' is any act or omission that makes the offender subject to  criminal punishment by law. A ``catastrophe'' is a disaster or imminent  disaster involving violent or sudden event affecting the public.  [57 FR 28640, June 26, 1992]</p>
