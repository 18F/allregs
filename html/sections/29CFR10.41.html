No particular form of  complaint is required. A complaint may be filed orally or in writing. If  the complainant is unable to file the complaint in English, the Wage and  Hour Division will accept the complaint in any language.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is the policy of the Department of Labor to protect the  identity of its confidential sources and to prevent an unwarranted  invasion of personal privacy. Accordingly, the identity of any  individual who makes a written or oral statement as a complaint or in  the course of an investigation, as well as portions of the statement  which would reveal the individual's identity, shall not be disclosed in  any manner to anyone other than Federal officials without the prior  consent of the individual. Disclosure of such statements shall be  governed by the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C.  552, see 29 CFR part 70) and the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).</p>
