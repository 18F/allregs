                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If, during the course of the formal hearing, the evidence  presented warrants consideration of an issue or issues not previously  considered, the hearing may be expanded to include the new issue. If in  the opinion of the administrative law judge the new issue requires  additional time for preparation, the parties shall be given a reasonable  time within which to prepare for it. If the new issue arises from  evidence that has not been considered by the district director, and such  evidence is likely to resolve the case without the need for a formal  hearing, the administrative law judge may remand the case to the  district director for his or her evaluation and recommendation pursuant  to, Sec. 702.316.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At any time prior to the filing of the compensation order in the  case, the administrative law judge may in his discretion, upon the  application of a party or upon his own motion, give notice that he will  consider any new issue. The parties shall be given not less than 10  days' notice of the hearing on such new issue. The parties may stipulate  that the issue may be heard at an earlier time and shall proceed to a  hearing on the new issue in the same manner as on an issue initially  considered.
