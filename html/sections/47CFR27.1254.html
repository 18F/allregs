After June 23, 2006, all  major modifications to existing BRS systems in use in the 2150-2160/62  MHz band will be authorized on a secondary basis to AWS systems, unless  the incumbent affirmatively justifies primary status and the incumbent  BRS licensee establishes that the modification would not add to the  relocation costs of AWS licensees. Major modifications include the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Additions of new transmit sites or base stations made after June  23, 2006;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Changes to existing facilities made after June 23, 2006, that  would increase the size or coverage of the service area, or interference  potential, and that would also increase the throughput of an existing  system (e.g., sector splits in the antenna system). Modifications to  fully utilize the existing throughput of existing facilities (e.g., to  add customers) will not be considered major modifications even if such  changes increase the size or coverage of the service area, or  interference potential.</p>
