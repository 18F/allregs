                                Sec. 1.172-3  Net operating loss in case of a taxpayer other than
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Modification of deductions. A net operating loss is sustained by  a taxpayer other than a corporation in any taxable year if and to the  extent that, for such year there is an excess of deductions allowed by  chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code over gross income computed  thereunder. In determining the excess of deductions over gross income  for such purpose:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Items not deductible. No deduction shall be allowed under:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 151 for the personal exemptions or under any other  section which grants a deduction in lieu of the deductions allowed by  section 151,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 172 for the net operating loss deduction, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Section 1202 in respect of the net long-term capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Capital losses. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount deductible on account of business  capital losses shall not exceed the sum of the amount includible on  account of business capital gains and that portion of nonbusiness  capital gains which is computed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount deductible on account of nonbusiness capital losses  shall not exceed the amount includible on account of nonbusiness capital  gains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Nonbusiness deductions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ordinary deductions. Ordinary  nonbusiness deductions shall be taken into account without regard to the  amount of business deductions and shall be allowed in full to the  extent, but not in excess, of that amount which is the sum of the  ordinary nonbusiness gross income and the excess of nonbusiness capital  gains over nonbusiness capital losses. See paragraph (c) of this  section. For purposes of section 172, nonbusiness deductions and income  are those deductions and that income which are not attributable to, or  derived from, a taxpayer's trade or business. Wages and salary  constitute income attributable to the taxpayer's trade or business for  such purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sale of business property. Any gain or loss on the sale or  other disposition of property which is used in the taxpayer's trade or  business and which is   of a character that is subject to the allowance for depreciation  provided in section 167, or of real property used in the taxpayer's  trade or business, shall be considered, for purposes of section  172(d)(4), as attributable to, or derived from, the taxpayer's trade or  business. Such gains and losses are to be taken into account fully in  computing a net operating loss without regard to the limitation on  nonbusiness deductions. Thus, a farmer who sells at a loss land used in  the business of farming may, in computing a net operating loss, include  in full the deduction otherwise allowable with respect to such loss,  without regard to the amount of his nonbusiness income and without  regard to whether he is engaged in the trade or business of selling  farms. Similarly, an individual who sells at a loss machinery which is  used in his trade or business and which is of a character that is  subject to the allowance for depreciation may, in computing the net  operating loss, include in full the deduction otherwise allowable with  respect to such loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Casualty losses. Any deduction allowable under section  165(c)(3) for losses of property not connected with a trade or business  shall not be considered, for purposes of section 172(d)(4), to be a  nonbusiness deduction but shall be treated as a deduction attributable  to the taxpayer's trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Self-employed retirement plans. Any deduction allowed under  section 404, relating to contributions of an employer to an employees'  trust or annuity plan, or under section 405(c), relating to  contributions to a bond purchase plan, to the extent attributable to  contributions made on behalf of an individual while he is an employee  within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), shall not be treated, for  purposes of section 172(d)(4), as attributable to, or derived from, the  taxpayer's trade or business, but shall be treated as a nonbusiness  deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Limitation. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not be  construed to permit the deduction of items disallowed by subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of Sec. 1.1212-1 and  takes into account a capital loss carryover from a preceding taxable  year, the composition (business--nonbusiness) of the net capital loss  for such preceding taxable year must also be determined. For purposes of  this paragraph, the term capital loss carryover means the sum of the  short-term and long-term capital loss carryovers from such year. This  paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, an individual, has $5,000 ordinary taxable income  (computed without regard to the deductions for personal exemptions) for  the calendar year 1954 and also has the following capital gains and  losses for such year: Business capital gains of $2,000; business capital  losses of $3,200; nonbusiness capital gains of $1,000; and nonbusiness  capital losses of $1,200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A's net capital loss for the taxable year 1954 is $400,  computed as follows:  Capital losses...............................................     $4,400 Capital gains................................................      3,000</p><p class="depth0">---------- Excess of capital losses over capital gains..................      1,400 Less: $1,000 of such ordinary taxable income.................      1,000</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Net capital loss for 1954................................        400</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A's capital losses for 1954 exceeded his capital gains for  such year by $1,400. Since A's business capital losses for 1954 exceeded  his business capital gains for such year by   $1,200, 6/7ths ($1,200/$1,400) of A's net capital loss for 1954 is  attributable to an excess of his business capital losses over his  business capital gains for such year. Similarly, 1/7th of the net  capital loss is attributable to the excess of nonbusiness capital losses  over nonbusiness capital gains. Since the capital loss carryover for  1954 to 1955 is $400, 6/7ths of $400, or $342.86, shall be treated as a  business capital loss in 1955; and 1/7th of $400, or $57.14, as a  nonbusiness capital loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, an individual who is computing a net operating  loss for the calendar year 1966, has a capital loss carryover from 1965  of $8,000. In order to apply the provisions of this paragraph, A must  determine what portion of the $8,000 carryover is attributable to the  excess of business capital losses over business capital gains and what  portion thereof is attributable to the excess of nonbusiness capital  losses over nonbusiness capital gains. For 1965, A had $10,000 ordinary  taxable income (computed without regard to the deductions for personal  exemptions), and a short-term capital loss carryover of $6,000 from  1964. In order to determine the composition (business--nonbusiness) of  the $8,000 carryover from 1965, A first determines that of the $6,000  carryover from 1964, $5,000 is a business capital loss and $1,000 is a  nonbusiness capital loss. This must be done since, under paragraph (b)  of Sec. 1.1212-1, the net capital loss for 1965 is computed by taking  into account the capital loss carryover from 1964. A's capital gains and  losses for 1965 are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Carried over</p><p class="depth0">1965       from 1964 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Business capital gains........................    $2,000               0 Business capital losses.......................     3,000          $5,000 Nonbusiness capital gains.....................     4,000               0 Nonbusiness capital losses....................     6,000           1,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A's net capital loss for the taxable year 1965 is $8,000,  computed as follows:  Capital losses (including carryovers)........................    $15,000 Capital gains................................................      6,000</p><p class="depth0">---------- Excess of capital losses over capital gains..................      9,000 Less: $1,000 of such ordinary taxable income.................      1,000</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Net capital loss for 1965................................      8,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A's capital losses, including carryovers, for 1965 exceeded  his capital gains for such year by $9,000. Since A's business capital  losses for 1965 exceeded his business capital gains for such year by  $6,000, 2/3rds ($6,000/$9,000) of A's net capital loss for 1965 is  attributable to an excess of his business capital losses over his  business capital gains for such year. Similarly, 1/3rd of the net  capital loss is attributable to the excess of nonbusiness capital losses  over nonbusiness capital gains. Since the total capital loss carryover  from 1965 to 1966 is $8,000, 2/3rds of $8,000, or $5,333.33, shall be  treated as a business capital loss in 1966; and 1/3rd of $8,000, or  $2,666.67, as a nonbusiness capital loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination of portion of nonbusiness capital gains available  for the deduction of business capital losses. In the computation of a  net operating loss a taxpayer other than a corporation must use his  nonbusiness capital gains for the deduction of his nonbusiness capital  losses. Any amount not necessary for this purpose shall then be used for  the deduction of any excess of ordinary nonbusiness deductions over  ordinary nonbusiness gross income. The remainder, computed by applying  the excess ordinary nonbusiness deductions against the excess  nonbusiness capital gains, shall be treated as nonbusiness capital gains  and used for the purpose of determining the deductibility of business  capital losses under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. This principle  may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A, an individual, has a total nonbusiness gross income  of $20,500, computed as follows:  Ordinary gross income........................................     $7,500 Capital gains................................................     13,000</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Total gross income.......................................     20,500</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A also has total nonbusiness deductions of $16,000, computed as  follows:  Ordinary deductions..........................................     $9,000 Capital loss.................................................      7,000</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Total deductions.........................................     16,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The portion of nonbusiness capital gains to be used for the  purpose of determining the deductibility of business capital losses is  $4,500, computed as follows:  Nonbusiness capital gains....................................    $13,000 Less: Nonbusiness capital loss...............................      7,000</p><p class="depth0">------------ Excess to be taken into account for purposes of paragraph         6,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section................................... Ordinary nonbusiness deductions...................     $9,000 Less: Ordinary nonbusiness gross income...........      7,500</p><p class="depth0">--------      1,500</p><p class="depth0">---------- Portion of nonbusiness capital gains to be used for purposes       4,500</p><p class="depth0">of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section......................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Joint net operating loss of husband and wife. In the case of a  husband and wife, the joint net operating loss for any taxable year for  which a joint return is filed is to be computed on the   basis of the combined income and deductions of both spouses, and the  modifications prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section are to be  computed as if the combined income and deductions of both spouses were  the income and deductions of one individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Illustration of computation of net operating loss of a taxpayer  other than a corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Facts. For the calendar year 1954 A, an  individual, has gross income of $483,000 and allowable deductions of  $540,000. The latter amount does not include the net operating loss  deduction or any deduction on account of the sale or exchange of capital  assets. Included in gross income are business capital gains of $50,000  and ordinary nonbusiness income of $10,000. Included among the  deductions are ordinary nonbusiness deductions of $12,000 and a  deduction of $600 for his personal exemption. A has a business capital  loss of $60,000 in 1954. A has no other items of income or deductions to  which section 172(d) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Computation. On the basis of these facts, A has a net operating  loss for 1954 of $104,400, computed as follows:  Deductions for 1954 (as specified in first sentence of          $540,000</p><p class="depth0">subparagraph (1))........................................... Plus: Amount of business capital loss ($60,000) to extent         50,000</p><p class="depth0">such amount does not exceed business capital gains ($50,000)</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Total....................................................    590,000 Less: Excess of ordinary nonbusiness deductions        $2,000</p><p class="depth0">over ordinary nonbusiness gross income ($12,000</p><p class="depth0">minus $10,000)...................................
