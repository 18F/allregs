The specific financial covenants may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following measures: consolidated net asset ratio; consolidated unrestricted net asset ratio; and minimum available liquidity (or, in the case of Eligible CDFIs that are regulated financial institutions, such ratios and information as may be required by the applicable Appropriate Federal Banking Agency or Appropriate State Agency). The specific financial requirements shall be measured based upon such Eligible CDFI's financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and consistent with historically applied accounting policies and practices.</p>
