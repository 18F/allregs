                                Sec. 1.457-5  Individual limitation for combined annual deferrals
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. The individual limitation under section 457(c) and  this section equals the basic annual deferral limitation under  Sec. 1.457-4(c)(1)(i)(A), plus either the age 50 catch-up amount under  Sec. 1.457-4(c)(2), or the special section 457 catch-up amount under  Sec. 1.457-4(c)(3), applied by taking into account the combined annual  deferral for the participant for any taxable year under all eligible  plans. While an eligible plan may include provisions under which it will  limit deferrals to meet the individual limitation under section 457(c)   and this section, annual deferrals by a participant that exceed the  individual limit under section 457(c) and this section (but do not  exceed the limits under Sec. 1.457-4(c)) will not cause a plan to lose  its eligible status. However, to the extent the combined annual  deferrals for a participant for any taxable year exceed the individual  limitation under section 457(c) and this section for that year, the  amounts are treated as excess deferrals as described in Sec. 1.457-4(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limitation applied to participant. The individual limitation in  this section applies to eligible plans of all employers for whom a  participant has performed services, including both eligible governmental  plans and eligible plans of a tax-exempt entity and both eligible plans  of the employer and eligible plans of other employers. Thus, for  purposes of determining the amount excluded from a participant's gross  income in any taxable year (including the underutilized limitation under  Sec. 1.457-4 (c)(3)(ii)(B)), the participant's annual deferral under an  eligible plan, and the participant's annual deferrals under all other  eligible plans, must be determined on an aggregate basis. To the extent  that the combined annual deferral amount exceeds the maximum deferral  limitation applicable under Sec. 1.457-4 (c)(1)(i)(A), (c)(2), or  (c)(3), the amount is treated as an excess deferral under Sec. 1.457- 4(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> and this  section are applied using the catch-up amount under whichever plan has  the largest catch-up amount applicable to the participant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Participant F is age 62 in 2006 and  participates in two eligible plans during 2006, Plans J and K, which are  each eligible plans of two different governmental entities. Each plan  includes provisions allowing the maximum annual deferral permitted under  Sec. 1.457-4(c)(1) through (3). For 2006, the underutilized amount under  Sec. 1.457-4 (c)(3)(ii)(B) is $20,000 under Plan J and is $40,000 under  Plan K. Normal retirement age is age 65 under both plans. Participant F  defers $15,000 under each plan. Participant F's includible compensation  is in each case in excess of the deferral. Neither plan designates the  $15,000 contribution as a catch-up permitted under each plan's special  section 457 catch-up provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. For purposes of applying this section to  Participant F for 2006, the maximum exclusion is $20,000. This is equal  to the sum of $15,000 plus $5,000, which is the age 50 catch-up amount.  Thus, F has an excess amount of $10,000 which is treated as an excess  deferral for Participant F for 2006 under Sec. 1.457-4(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em> is $15,000. For year 2006, the additional age  50 catch-up limitation that applies to Participant E under all four  plans under Sec. 1.457-4(c)(2) is $5,000. Further, for year 2006,  different limitations under Sec. 1.457-4(c)(3) and (c)(3)(ii)(B) apply  to Participant E under each of these plans, as follows: under Plan W,  the underutilized limitation under Sec. 1.457-4(c)(3)(ii)(B) is $7,000;  under Plan X, the underutilized limitation under Sec. 1.457- 4(c)(3)(ii)(B) is $2,000; under Plan Y, the underutilized limitation  under Sec. 1.457-4(c)(3)(ii)(B) is $8,000; and under Plan Z, Sec. 1.457- 4(c)(3) is not applicable since normal retirement age is 62 under Plan  Z. Participant E's includible compensation is in each case in excess of  any applicable deferral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. For purposes of applying this section to  Participant E for year 2006, Participant E could elect to defer $23,000  under Plan Y, which is the maximum deferral limitation under Sec. 1.457- 4(c)(1) through (3), and to defer no amount under Plans W, X, and Z. The  $23,000 maximum amount is equal to the sum of $15,000 plus $8,000, which  is the catch-up amount applicable to Participant E under Plan Y and  which is the largest catch-up amount applicable to Participant E under  any of the four plans for year 2006. Alternatively, Participant E could  instead elect to defer the following combination of amounts: An  aggregate total of $15,000 to Plans X, Y, and Z, if no contribution is  made to Plan W; an aggregate total of $20,000 to   any of the four plans, assuming at least $5,000 is contributed to Plan  W; or $22,000 to Plan W and none to any of the other three plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the underutilized amount under Plans W, X, and Y for year  2006 were in each case zero (because E had always contributed the  maximum amount or E was a new participant) or an amount not in excess of  $5,000, the maximum exclusion under this section would be $20,000 for  Participant E for year 2006 ($15,000 plus the $5,000 age 50 catch-up  amount), which Participant E could contribute to any of the plans  assuming at least $5,000 is contributed to Plan W.
