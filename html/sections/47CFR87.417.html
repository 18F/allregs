Control towers and RCOs provide air traffic control services to aircraft landing, taking off and taxing on the airport as well as aircraft transiting the airport traffic area. Additionally, control towers and RCOs can provide air traffic control services to vehicles operating on airport movement areas (see subpart L of this part). Control towers and RCOs must serve all aircraft without discrimination. An RCO must be remotely operated from a control tower or other FAA control facility located at a nearby airport.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A control tower must maintain a continuous watch on the following frequencies during the hours of operation:
121.500 MHz3023.0 kHz (Alaska only)5680.0 kHz (Alaska only)</p><p class="depth2">The Commission may exempt from these watch requirements the licensee of an airport control tower station if a satisfactory showing has been made that such an exemption will not adversely affect life and property in the air.
