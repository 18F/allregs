                                Sec. 29.573  Damage Tolerance and Fatigue Evaluation of Composite
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each applicant must evaluate the composite rotorcraft structure  under the damage tolerance standards of paragraph (d) of this section  unless the applicant establishes that a damage tolerance evaluation is  impractical within the limits of geometry, inspectability, and good  design practice. If an applicant establishes that it is impractical  within the limits of geometry, inspectability, and good design practice,  the applicant must do a fatigue evaluation in accordance with paragraph  (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The methodology used to establish compliance with this section  must be submitted to and approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Catastrophic failure is an event that could prevent continued  safe flight and landing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Principal Structural Elements (PSEs) are structural elements  that contribute significantly to the carrying of flight or ground loads,  the failure of which could result in catastrophic failure of the  rotorcraft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Threat Assessment is an assessment that specifies the locations,  types, and sizes of damage, considering fatigue, environmental effects,  intrinsic and discrete flaws, and impact or other accidental damage  (including the discrete source of the accidental damage) that may occur  during manufacture or operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Damage Tolerance Evaluation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each applicant must show that catastrophic failure due to static  and fatigue loads, considering the intrinsic or discrete manufacturing  defects or accidental damage, is avoided throughout the operational life  or prescribed inspection intervals of the rotorcraft by performing  damage tolerance evaluations of the strength of composite PSEs and other  parts, detail design points, and fabrication techniques. Each applicant  must account for the effects of material and process variability along  with environmental conditions in the strength and fatigue evaluations.  Each applicant must evaluate parts that include PSEs of the airframe,  main and tail rotor drive systems, main and tail rotor blades and hubs,  rotor controls, fixed and movable control surfaces, engine and  transmission mountings, landing gear, other parts, detail design points,  and fabrication techniques deemed critical by the FAA. Each damage  tolerance evaluation must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The identification of all PSEs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In-flight and ground measurements for determining the loads or  stresses for all PSEs for all critical conditions throughout the range  of limits in Sec. 29.309 (including altitude effects), except that  maneuvering load factors need not exceed the maximum values expected in  service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The loading spectra as severe as those expected in service  based on loads or stresses determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this  section, including external load operations, if applicable, and other  operations including high-torque events;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A threat assessment for all PSEs that specifies the locations,  types, and sizes of damage, considering fatigue, environmental effects,  intrinsic and discrete flaws, and impact or other accidental damage  (including the discrete source of the accidental damage) that may occur  during manufacture or operation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An assessment of the residual strength and fatigue  characteristics of all PSEs that supports the replacement times and  inspection intervals established under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each applicant must establish replacement times, inspections, or  other procedures for all PSEs to require the repair or replacement of  damaged parts before a catastrophic failure. These replacement times,  inspections, or other procedures must be included in the Airworthiness  Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness  required by Sec. 29.1529.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Replacement times for PSEs must be determined by tests, or by  analysis supported by tests, and must show that the structure is able to  withstand the repeated loads of variable magnitude expected in-service.  In establishing these replacement times, the following items must be  considered:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Damage identified in the threat assessment required by paragraph  (d)(1)(iv) of this section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Maximum acceptable manufacturing defects and in-service damage  (i.e., those that do not lower the residual strength below ultimate  design loads and those that can be repaired to restore ultimate  strength); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Ultimate load strength capability after applying repeated loads.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inspection intervals for PSEs must be established to reveal any  damage identified in the threat assessment required by paragraph  (d)(1)(iv) of this section that may occur from fatigue or other in- service causes before such damage has grown to the extent that the  component cannot sustain the required residual strength capability. In  establishing these inspection intervals, the following items must be  considered:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The growth rate, including no-growth, of the damage under the  repeated loads expected in-service determined by tests or analysis  supported by tests;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The required residual strength for the assumed damage  established after considering the damage type, inspection interval,  detectability of damage, and the techniques adopted for damage   detection. The minimum required residual strength is limit load; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Whether the inspection will detect the damage growth before the  minimum residual strength is reached and restored to ultimate load  capability, or whether the component will require replacement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each applicant must consider the effects of damage on stiffness,  dynamic behavior, loads, and functional performance on all PSEs when  substantiating the maximum assumed damage size and inspection interval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fatigue Evaluation: If an applicant establishes that the damage  tolerance evaluation described in paragraph (d) of this section is  impractical within the limits of geometry, inspectability, or good  design practice, the applicant must do a fatigue evaluation of the  particular composite rotorcraft structure and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify all PSEs considered in the fatigue evaluation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify the types of damage for all PSEs considered in the  fatigue evaluation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Establish supplemental procedures to minimize the risk of  catastrophic failure associated with the damages identified in paragraph  (d) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Include these supplemental procedures in the Airworthiness  Limitations section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness  required by Sec. 29.1529.
