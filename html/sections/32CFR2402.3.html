                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Non-exempt records available to public. Except for records exempt from disclosure by 5 U.S.C. 552(b) or published in the Federal Register under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1), agency records of OSTP subject to FOIA are available to any person who requests them in accordance with these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Record availability at the OSTP e-FOIA Reading Room. OSTP shall make records available on its Web site in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), as amended, and other documents that, because of the nature of their subject matter, are likely to be the subject of FOIA requests. To save both time and money, OSTP strongly urges requesters to review documents available at the OSTP e-FOIA Reading Room before submitting a request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All of the terms defined in the Freedom of Information Act, and the definitions included in the ``Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines'' issued by the Office of Management and Budget apply, unless otherwise defined in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term ``commercial use request'' means a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. OSTP shall determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested records. When it appears that the requester will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or because OSTP has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated use, OSTP shall provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The terms ``disclose'' or ``disclosure'' refer to making records available, upon request, for examination and copying, or furnishing a copy of records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The term ``duplication'' means the making of a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or electronic records (for example, magnetic tape or disk), among others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The term ``educational institution'' means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education that operates a program of scholarly research. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scholarly research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The term ``fee waiver'' means the waiver or reduction of processing fees if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The term ``FOIA Public Liaison'' means an agency official who is responsible for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The term ``noncommercial scientific institution'' means an institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis, as that term is defined in these regulations, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scientific research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The term ``perfected request'' means a FOIA request for records that adequately describes the records sought, that has been received by OSTP, and for which there is no remaining question about the payment of applicable fees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The terms ``representative of the news media'' or ``news media requester'' mean any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. In this clause, the term ``news'' means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if

such entities qualify as disseminators of `news') who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; the Government may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The term ``search'' refers to the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The term ``working day'' means a regular Federal working day. It does not include Saturdays, Sundays, or legal Federal holidays.</p>
