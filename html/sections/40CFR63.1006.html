Unless otherwise specified in Sec.  63.1002(b), or Sec.  63.1016, or in paragraph (e) of this section, or the referencing subpart, the owner or operator shall monitor all valves at the intervals specified in paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(6) of this section and shall comply with all other provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Monitoring method. The valves shall be monitored to detect leaks by the method specified in Sec.  63.1004(b) and (c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Instrument reading that defines a leak. The instrument reading that defines a leak is 10,000 parts per million or greater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monitoring period. (i) Each valve shall be monitored monthly to detect leaks, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii), (e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(4) of this section.

The first quarterly monitoring shall occur less than 3 months following the last monthly monitoring.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If a leak is detected, the valve shall be monitored monthly until a leak is not detected for 2 successive months.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, quarter means a 3-month period with the first quarter concluding on the last day of the last full month during the 180 days following initial startup.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Allowance of alternative standards. An owner or operator may elect to comply with one of the alternatives specified in either paragraph (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section if the percentage of valves leaking is equal to or less than 2.0 percent as determined by the procedure in paragraph (c) of this section. An owner or operator must notify the Administrator before implementing one of the alternatives specified in either paragraph (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Allowable percentage alternative. An owner or operator choosing to comply with the allowable percentage alternative shall have an allowable percentage of leakers no greater than 2.0 percent for each affected facility or process unit and shall comply with paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A compliance demonstration for each affected facility or process unit or affected facility complying with this alternative shall be conducted initially upon designation, annually, and at other times requested by the Administrator. For each such demonstration, all valves in gas and vapor and light liquid service within the affected facility or process unit shall be monitored within 1 week by the methods specified in Sec.  63.1004(b). If an instrument reading exceeds the equipment leak level specified in the referencing subpart, a leak is detected. The leak percentage shall be calculated as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If an owner or operator decides no longer to comply with this alternative, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator in writing that the work practice standard described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section will be followed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Skip period alternatives. An owner or operator may elect to comply with one of the alternative work practices specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) or (b)(6)(ii) of this section. An owner or operator electing to use one of these skip period alternatives shall comply with paragraphs (b)(6)(iii) and (b)(6)(iv) of this section. Before using either skip period alternative, the owner or operator shall initially comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Monitoring data generated before the regulated source became subject to the referencing subpart that meets the criteria of either Sec.  63.1004(b)(1) through (b)(5), or Sec.  63.1004(b)(6), may be used to initially qualify for skip period alternatives.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> After 2 consecutive quarterly leak detection periods with the percent of valves leaking equal to or less than 2.0 as determined by the procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, an owner or operator may begin to monitor for leaks once every 6 months.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After 5 consecutive quarterly leak detection periods with the percent of valves leaking equal to or less than 2.0 as determined by the procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, an owner or operator may begin to monitor for leaks once every year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the percent of valves leaking is greater than 2.0, the owner or operator shall comply with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, but can elect to comply with paragraph (b)(6) of this section if future percent of valves leaking is again equal to or less than 2.0.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The owner or operator shall keep a record of the monitoring schedule and the percent of valves found leaking during each monitoring period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Percent leaking valves calculation--calculation basis and procedures. (1) The owner or operator shall decide no later than the compliance date of this subpart, or upon revision of an operating permit whether to calculate percent leaking valves on a process unit or group of process units basis. Once the owner or operator has decided, all subsequent percentage calculations shall be made on the same basis and this shall be the basis used for comparison with the subgrouping criteria specified in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator shall decide no later than the compliance date of this subpart, or upon revision of an operating permit whether to calculate percent leaking valves on a process unit or group of process units basis.
