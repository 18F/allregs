Each reference to a year in this subpart refers to the calendar year, unless otherwise specified. Paragraph (b) of this section specifies baseline fees, which applied for certificates received in 2005. For engine and vehicles not yet subject to standards in 2005, these values represent the fees that apply initially based on available information to characterize what the fees would have been in 2005. See paragraph (c) of this section for provisions describing how we calculate fees for future years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following baseline fees for each application for certification:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for Independent Commercial Importers, the following fees apply for motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines:
