The owner or operator shall determine the composition of the coatings by formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating or from data determined by an analysis of each coating, as received, by Method 24. The Administrator may require the owner or operator who uses formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating to determine data used in the calculation of the VOC content of coatings by Method 24 or an equivalent or alternative method. The owner or operator shall determine from company records on a monthly basis the volume of coating consumed, as received, and the mass of solvent used for thinning purposes. The volume weighted average of the total mass of VOC per volume of coating solids used each calendar month will be determined by the following procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Calculate the mass of VOC used in each calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation where ``n'' is the total number of coatings used and ``m'' is the total number of VOC solvents used:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.027

The values in the table above represent an overall system efficiency which includes a total capture of purge. If a spray system uses line purging after each vehicle and does not collect any of the purge material, the following table shall be used:
