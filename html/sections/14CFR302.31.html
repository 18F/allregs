                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Action by administrative law judge after hearing. Except where  the DOT decisionmaker directs otherwise, after the taking of evidence  and the receipt of briefs which may include proposed findings of fact  and conclusions of law, if any, the administrative law judge shall take  the following action:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial decision. If the proceeding does not involve foreign air  transportation, the administrative law judge shall render an ``initial  decision.'' Such decision shall encompass the administrative law judge's  decision on the merits of the proceeding and on all ancillary procedural  issues remaining for disposition at the close of the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recommended decision. In cases where the action of the  Department involves foreign air transportation and is subject to review  by the President of the United States pursuant to section 41307 of the  Statute, the administrative law judge shall render a ``recommended  decision.'' Such decision shall encompass the administrative law judge's  decision on the merits of the proceeding and on all ancillary procedural  issues remaining for disposition at the close of the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certification to the DOT decisionmaker for decision. At any time  prior to the close of the hearing, the DOT decisionmaker may direct the  administrative law judge to certify any question or the entire record in  the proceeding to the DOT decisionmaker for decision. In cases where the  record is thus certified, the administrative law judge shall not render  a decision but shall make a recommendation to the DOT decisionmaker as  required by section 8(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.  558(a)) unless advised by the DOT decisionmaker that he or she intends  to issue a tentative decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Every initial or recommended decision issued shall state the  names of the persons who are to be served with copies of it, the time  within which exceptions to, or petitions for review of, such decision  may be filed, and the time within which briefs in support of the  exceptions may be filed. In addition, every such decision shall recite  that it is made under delegated authority, and contain notice of the  provisions of paragraph (d) of this section. In the event the  administrative law judge certifies the record to the DOT decisionmaker  without an initial or recommended decision, he or she shall notify the  parties of the time within which to file with the DOT decisionmaker  briefs which may include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of  law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unless a petition for discretionary review is filed pursuant to  Sec. 302.32, exceptions are filed pursuant to Sec. 302.217, or the DOT  decisionmaker issues an order to review upon his or her own initiative,  the initial decision shall become effective as the final order of the  Department thirty (30) days after service thereof; in the case of a  recommended decision, that decision shall be transmitted to the  President of the United States under 49 U.S.C. 41307. If a petition for  discretionary review or exceptions are timely filed or action to review  is taken by the DOT decisionmaker upon his or her own initiative, the  effectiveness of the initial decision or the transmission of the  recommended decision is stayed until the further order of the DOT  decisionmaker.</p>
