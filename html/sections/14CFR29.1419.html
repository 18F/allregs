                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To obtain certification for flight into icing conditions, compliance with this section must be shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It must be demonstrated that the rotorcraft can be safely operated in the continuous maximum and intermittent maximum icing conditions determined under appendix C of this part within the rotorcraft altitude envelope. An analysis must be performed to establish, on the basis of the rotorcraft's operational needs, the adequacy of the ice protection system for the various components of the rotorcraft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to the analysis and physical evaluation prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, the effectiveness of the ice protection system and its components must be shown by flight tests of the rotorcraft or its components in measured natural atmospheric icing conditions and by one or more of the following tests as found necessary to determine the adequacy of the ice protection system:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Laboratory dry air or simulated icing tests, or a combination of both, of the components or models of the components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Flight dry air tests of the ice protection system as a whole, or its individual components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Flight tests of the rotorcraft or its components in measured simulated icing conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The ice protection provisions of this section are considered to be applicable primarily to the airframe. Powerplant installation requirements are contained in Subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A means must be identified or provided for determining the formation of ice on critical parts of the rotorcraft. Unless otherwise restricted, the means must be available for nighttime as well as daytime operation. The rotorcraft flight manual must describe the means of determining ice formation and must contain information necessary for safe operation of the rotorcraft in icing conditions.
