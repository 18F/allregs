                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section describes how to appeal decisions made by  SSA under the Privacy Act concerning your request for correction of or  access to your records, those of your minor child, or those of a person  for whom you are the legal guardian. We generally handle a denial of  your request for information about another person under the provisions  of the Freedom of Information Act (see part 402 of this chapter). To  appeal a decision under this section, your request must be in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appeal of refusal to correct or amend records. If we deny your  request to correct an SSA record, you may request a review of that  decision. As discussed in Sec. 401.65(e), our letter denying your  request will tell you to whom to write.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We will review your request within 30 working days from the date  of the receipt. However, for a good reason and with the approval of the  Executive Director for the Office of Public Disclosure, this time limit  may be extended up to an additional 30 days. In that case, we will  notify you about the delay, the reason for it and the date when the  review is expected to be completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If, after review, we determine that the record should be  corrected, we will do so. However, if we refuse to amend the record as  you requested, we will inform you that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Your request has been refused and the reason for refusing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The refusal is SSA's final decision; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You have a right to seek court review of SSA's final decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We will also inform you that you have a right to file a  statement of disagreement with the decision. Your statement should  include the reason you disagree. We will make your statement available  to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed, together with a  statement of our reasons for refusing to amend the record. Also, we will  provide a copy of your statement to individuals whom we are aware  received the record previously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeals after denial of access. If, under the Privacy Act, we  deny your request for access to your own record, those of your minor  child or those of a person to whom you are the legal guardian, we will  advise you in writing of the reason for that denial, the name and title  or position of the person responsible for the decision and your right to  appeal that decision. You may appeal the denial decision to the  Executive Director for the Office of Public Disclosure, 6401 Security  Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235-6401, within 30 days after you receive  notice denying all or part of your request, or, if later, within 30 days  after you receive materials sent to you in partial compliance with your  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Filing your appeal. If you file an appeal, the Executive  Director or his or her designee will review your request and any  supporting information submitted and then send you a notice explaining  the decision on your appeal. The time limit for making our decision  after we receive your appeal is 30 working days. The Executive Director  or his or her designee may extend this time limit up to 30 additional  working days if one of the circumstances in 20 CFR 402.140 is met. We  will notify you in writing of any extension, the reason for the  extension and the date by which we will decide your appeal. The notice  of the decision on your appeal will explain your right to have the  matter reviewed in a Federal district court if you disagree with all or  part of our decision.
