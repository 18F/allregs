Prior to its introduction into service and annually thereafter, the NDIR carbon monoxide analyzer shall be checked for response to water vapor and CO2 in accordance with Sec. 318.96(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into service, after any maintenance which could alter calibration, and every two months thereafter, the NDIR carbon monoxide analyzer shall be calibrated. New calibration curves need not be generated every two months if the existing curve can be verified as continuing to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Zero the carbon monoxide analyzer with either zero-grade air or zero-grade nitrogen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Calibrate on each used operating range with carbon monoxide-in-N2 calibration gases having nominal concentrations starting between 10 and 15 percent and increasing in at least six incremental steps to 90 percent (e.g., 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 percent) of that range. The incremental steps are to be spaced to represent good engineering practice. For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line is 2 percent or less of the value at each non-zero data point and within [0.3 percent of full scale on the zero, concentration values may be calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds these limits, the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within these limits shall be used to determine concentration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The initial and periodic interference, system check, and calibration test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065 may be used in lieu of the procedures specified in this section.
