(1) Copper-alloy brazing may be employed to join pipe, valves, and fittings. Circumferential joints may be either of the butt or socket type. Where butt joints are employed, the included angle shall be not less than 90[deg] where the wall thickness

is three-sixteenths of an inch or greater. The annular clearance of socket joints shall be held to small clearances which experience indicates is satisfactory for the brazing alloy to be employed, method of heating, and material to be joined.

The brazing shall be done by placing the flux and brazing material on one side of the joint and applying heat until the brazing material flows entirely through the lap and shows uniformly along the seam on the other side of the joint. Sufficient flux shall be used to cause the brazing material to appear promptly after reaching the brazing temperature.</p><p class="depth3">Subpart 56.80_Bending and Forming</p>
