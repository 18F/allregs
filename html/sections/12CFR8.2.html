                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each national bank and each Federal savings association shall pay to the Comptroller of the Currency a semiannual assessment fee, due by March 31 and September 30 of each year, for the six-month period beginning on January 1 and July 1 before each payment date. The Comptroller of the Currency will calculate the amount due under this section and provide a notice of assessments to each national bank and each Federal savings association no later than 7 business days prior to collection on March 31 and September 30 of each year. In setting assessments, the Comptroller of the Currency may take into account the nature and scope of the activities of a national bank or Federal savings association, the amount and type of assets that the entity holds, the financial and managerial condition of the entity, and any other factor the Comptroller of the Currency determines is appropriate, as provided by 12 U.S.C. 16. The semiannual assessment will be calculated as follows:

A bank's or Federal savings association's semiannual assessment is composed of two parts. The first part is the calculation of a base amount of the assessment, which is computed on the assets of the bank or Federal savings association up to the lower endpoint (Column A) of the bracket in which it falls. This base amount of the assessment is calculated by the OCC in Column C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The second part is the calculation of assessments due on the remaining assets of the bank or Federal savings association in excess of Column E. The excess is assessed at the marginal rate shown in Column D.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The total semiannual assessment is the amount in Column C, plus the amount of the bank's or Federal savings association's assets in excess of Column E times the marginal rate in Column D:
Assessments = C+[(Assets-E) x D].</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each year, the OCC may index the marginal rates in Column D to adjust for the percent change in the level of prices, as measured by changes in the Gross Domestic Product Implicit Price Deflator (GDPIPD) for each June-to-June period. The OCC may at its discretion adjust marginal rates by

amounts other than the percentage change in the GDPIPD. The OCC will also adjust the amounts in Column C to reflect any change made to the marginal rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The specific marginal rates and complete assessment schedule will be published in the ``Notice of Comptroller of the Currency Fees,'' provided for at Sec. 8.8 of this part. Each semiannual assessment is based upon the total assets shown in the national bank's or Federal savings association's most recent ``Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income'' (Call Report) or ``Thrift Financial Report,'' as appropriate, preceding the payment date. Each bank or Federal savings association subject to the jurisdiction of the Comptroller of the Currency on the date of the second or fourth quarterly Call Report or Thrift Financial Report, as appropriate, required by the Office under 12 U.S.C. 161 and 12 U.S.C. 1464(v) is subject to the full assessment for the next six month period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)(i)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the OCC may reduce the semiannual assessment for each non-lead bank or non-lead Federal savings association by a percentage that it will specify in the ``Notice of Comptroller of the Currency Fees'' described in Sec. 8.8.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the OCC may reduce the semiannual assessment for each non-lead bank or non-lead Federal savings association by a percentage that it will specify in the ``Notice of Comptroller of the Currency Fees'' described in Sec. 8.8.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (a)(6):</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Lead bank or lead Federal savings association means the largest national bank or Federal savings association controlled by a company, based on a comparison of the total assets held by each national bank or Federal savings association controlled by that company as reported in each bank's or Federal savings association's Call Report or Thrift Financial Report, as appropriate, filed for the quarter immediately preceding the payment of a semiannual assessment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Non-lead bank or non-lead Federal savings association means a national bank or Federal savings association that is not the lead bank or lead Federal savings association controlled by a company that controls two or more national banks or Federal savings associations.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Control and company with respect to national banks have the same meanings as these terms have in sections 2(a)(2) and 2(b), respectively, of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841(a)(2) and (b)).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Control and company with respect to Federal savings associations have the same meanings as these terms have in section 10(a) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1467a(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Each Federal branch and each Federal agency shall pay to the Comptroller of the Currency a semiannual assessment fee, due by March 31 and September 30 of each year, for the six month period beginning on January 1 and July 1 before each payment date.
