                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The requirements of part 9903 shall, to the maximum extent  practicable, be administered by the cognizant Federal agency responsible  for a particular contractor organization or location, usually the  Federal agency responsible for negotiating indirect cost rates on behalf  of the Government. The cognizant Federal agency should take the lead  role in administering the requirements of part 9903 and coordinating CAS  administrative actions with all affected Federal agencies. When multiple  CAS-covered contracts or more than one Federal agency are involved,  agencies should discourage Contracting Officers from individually  administering CAS on a contract-by-contract basis. Coordinated  administrative actions will provide greater assurances that individual  contractors follow their cost accounting practices consistently under  all their CAS-covered contracts and that changes in cost accounting  practices or CAS noncompliance issues are resolved, equitably, in a  uniform overall manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal agencies shall prescribe regulations and establish  internal policies and procedures governing how agencies will administer  the requirements of CAS-covered contracts, with particular emphasis on  inter-agency coordination activities. Procedures to be followed when an  agency is and is not the cognizant Federal agency should be clearly  delineated. Internal agency policies and procedures shall provide for  the designation of the agency office(s) or officials responsible for  administering CAS under the agency's CAS-covered contracts at each  contractor business unit and the delegation of necessary contracting  authority to agency individuals authorized to administer the terms and  conditions of CAS-covered contracts, e.g., Administrative Contracting  Officers (ACOs) or other agency officials authorized to perform in that  capacity. Agencies are urged to coordinate on the development of such  regulations.  [59 FR 55756, Nov. 8, 1994]</p>
