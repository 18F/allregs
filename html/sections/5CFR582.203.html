Parties seeking  garnishment actions, therefore, should provide as many of the following  identifying pieces of information concerning the employee-obligor as  possible:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Full name;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Date of birth;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employment number or social security number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Component of the agency for which the employee-obligor works;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Official duty station or worksite; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Home address or current mailing address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the information submitted is not sufficient to identify the  employee-obligor, the legal process shall be returned directly to the  court, or other authority, with an explanation of the deficiency.  However, prior to returning the legal process, if there is sufficient  time prior to the time limits imposed in Sec. 582.303, an attempt  should be made to inform the person who caused the legal process to be  served, or the person's representative, that it will not be honored  unless adequate identifying information is supplied.</p>
