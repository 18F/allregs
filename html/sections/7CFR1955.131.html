                            <p class="depth0">The services of licensed auctioneers, if required, may be used to  conduct auction sales as described in Sec. 1955.148 of this subpart and  procured by competitive negotiation under the contracting authority of  Exhibit C to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  Instruction 2024-A (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 office).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Selection criteria. The auctioneer should be selected by  evaluating criteria such as proposed sales dates, location, advertising,  broker cooperation, innovations, mechanics of sale, sample advertising,  personal qualifications, financial capability, private sector financing  and license/bonding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Commission. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 may not set the commission rate in an auctioneer solicitation/ contract. The rate of commission will be one of the evaluation criteria  in the solicitation. However, any offeror that submits an offer with a  commission rate lower than the typical rate for such services in the  area must include documentation that they have successfully sold  properties at the lower rate with no compromise in services. The  solicitation/contract will explicitly detail this policy. Commissions  will be paid at closing if sufficient cash to cover the commission is  paid by the purchaser. Otherwise, the commission will be paid by the  appropriate FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  official completing Form AD-838 and processing Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 838-B for payment in  accordance with the respective FMI's, and charged to the inventory  account as a nonrecoverable cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Auctioneer restriction. The auctioneer, his/her sales agents,  cooperating brokers or persons living in his, her or their immediate  household are restricted from bidding or from subsequent purchase of any  property sold or offered at the auctioneer's sale for a period of one  year from the auction date.
