                                Sec. 20.2037-1  Transfers taking effect at death.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A decedent's gross estate includes under section  2037 the   value of any interest in property transferred by the decedent after  September 7, 1916, whether in trust or otherwise, except to the extent  that the transfer was for an adequate and full consideration in money or  money's worth (see Sec. 20.2043-1), if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Possession or enjoyment of the property could, through ownership  of the interest, have been obtained only by surviving the decedent,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The decedent had retained a possibility (referred to in this  section as a ``reversionary interest'') that the property, other than  the income alone, would return to the decedent or his estate or would be  subject to a power of disposition by him, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The value of the reversionary interest immediately before the  decedent's death exceeded 5 percent of the value of the entire property.  However, if the transfer was made before October 8, 1949, section 2037  is applicable only if the reversionary interest arose by the express  terms of the instrument of transfer and not by operation of law (see  paragraph (f) of this section). See also paragraph (g) of this section  with respect to transfers made between November 11, 1935, and January  29, 1940. The provisions of section 2037 do not apply to transfers made  before September 8, 1916.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Condition of survivorship. As indicated in paragraph (a) of this  section, the value of an interest in transferred property is not  included in a decedent's gross estate under section 2037 unless  possession or enjoyment of the property could, through ownership of such  interest, have been obtained only by surviving the decedent. Thus,  property is not included in the decedent's gross estate if, immediately  before the decedent's death, possession or enjoyment of the property  could have been obtained by any beneficiary either by surviving the  decedent or through the occurrence of some other event such as the  expiration of a term of years. However, if a consideration of the terms  and circumstances of the transfer as a whole indicates that the ``other  event'' is unreal and if the death of the decedent does, in fact, occur  before the ``other event'', the beneficiary will be considered able to  possess or enjoy the property only by surviving the decedent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest in transferred property is  not includible in a decedent's gross estate under section 2037 if  possession or enjoyment of the property could have been obtained by any  beneficiary during the decedent's life through the exercise of a general  power of appointment (as defined in section 2041) which in fact was  exercisable immediately before the decedent's death. See examples (5)  and (6) in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Retention of reversionary interest. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As indicated in  paragraph (a) of this section, the value of an interest in transferred  property is not included in a decedent's gross estate under section 2037  unless the decedent had retained a reversionary interest in the  property, and the value of the reversionary interest immediately before  the death of the decedent exceeded 5 percent of the value of the  property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of section 2037, the term ``reversionary interest''  includes a possibility that property transferred by the decedent may  return to him or his estate and a possibility that property transferred  by the decedent may become subject to a power of disposition by him. The  term is not used in a technical sense, but has reference to any reserved  right under which the transferred property shall or may be returned to  the grantor. Thus, it encompasses an interest arising either by the  express terms of the instrument of transfer or by operation of law.  (See, however, paragraph (f) of this section with respect to transfers  made before October 8, 1949.) The term ``reversionary interest'' does  not include rights to income only, such as the right to receive the  income from a trust after the death of another person. (However, see  section 2036 for the inclusion of property in the gross estate on  account of such rights.) Nor does the term ``reversionary interest''  include the possibility that the decedent during his lifetime might have  received back an interest in transferred property by inheritance through  the estate of another person. Similarly, a statutory right of a spouse  to receive a portion of whatever estate a decedent may leave at the time  of his death is not a ``reversionary interest''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this section, the value of the decedent's  reversionary interest is computed as of the moment immediately before  his death, without regard to whether or not the executor elects the  alternate valuation method under section 2032 and without regard to the  fact of the decedent's death. The value is ascertained in accordance  with recognized valuation principles for determining the value for  estate tax purposes of future or conditional interests in property. (See  Sec. Sec. 20.2031-1, 20.2031-7, and 20.2031-9). For example, if the  decedent's reversionary interest was subject to an outstanding life  estate in his wife, his interest is valued according to the actuarial  rules set forth in Sec. 20.2031-7. On the other hand, if the decedent's  reversionary interest was contingent on the death of his wife without  issue surviving and if it cannot be shown that his wife is incapable of  having issue (so that his interest is not subject to valuation according  to the actuarial rules in Sec. 20.2031-7), his interest is valued  according to the general rules set forth in Sec. 20.2031-1. A  possibility that the decedent may be able to dispose of property under  certain conditions is considered to have the same value as a right of  the decedent to the return of the property under those same conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In order to determine whether or not the decedent retained a  reversionary interest in transferred property of a value in excess of 5  percent, the value of the reversionary interest is compared with the  value of the transferred property, including interests therein which are  not dependent upon survivorship of the decedent. For example, assume  that the decedent, A, transferred property in trust with the income  payable to B for life and with the remainder payable to C if A  predeceases B, but with the property to revert to A if B predeceases A.  Assume further that A does, in fact, predecease B. The value of A's  reversionary interest immediately before his death is compared with the  value of the trust corpus, without deduction of the value of B's  outstanding life estate. If, in the above example, A had retained a  reversionary interest in one-half only of the trust corpus, the value of  his reversionary interest would be compared with the value of one-half  of the trust corpus, again without deduction of any part of the value of  B's outstanding life estate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transfers partly taking effect at death. If separate interests  in property are transferred to one or more beneficiaries, paragraphs (a)  to (c) of this section are to be separately applied with respect to each  interest. For example, assume that the decedent transferred an interest  in Blackacre to A which could be possessed or enjoyed only by surviving  the decedent, and that the decedent transferred an interest in Blackacre  to B which could be possessed or enjoyed only on the occurrence of some  event unrelated to the decedent's death. Assume further that the  decedent retained a reversionary interest in Blackacre of a value in  excess of 5 percent. Only the value of the interest transferred to A is  includible in the decedent's gross estate. Similar results would obtain  if possession or enjoyment of the entire property could have been  obtained only by surviving the decedent, but the decedent had retained a  reversionary interest in a part only of such property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraphs (a) to (d) of this  section may be further illustrated by the following examples. It is  assumed that the transfers were made on or after October 8, 1949; for  the significance of this date, see paragraphs (f) and (g) of this  section:</p><p class="depth2">Example (1). The decedent transferred property in trust with the  income payable to his wife for life and, at her death, remainder to the  decedent's then surviving children, or if none, to the decedent or his  estate. Since each beneficiary can possess or enjoy the property without  surviving the decedent, no part of the property is includible in the  decedent's gross estate under section 2037, regardless of the value of  the decedent's reversionary interest. (However, see section 2033 for  inclusion of the value of the reversionary interest in the decedent's  gross estate.)</p><p class="depth2">Example (2). The decedent transferred property in trust with the  income to be accumulated for the decedent's life, and at his death,  principal and accumulated income to be paid to the decedent's then  surviving issue, or, if none, to A or A's estate. Since the decedent  retained no reversionary interest in the property, no part of the  property is includible in the decedent's gross estate, even   though possession or enjoyment of the property could be obtained by the  issue only by surviving the decedent.</p><p class="depth2">Example (3). The decedent transferred property in trust with the  income payable to his wife for life and with the remainder payable to  the decedent or, if he is not living at his wife's death, to his  daughter or her estate. The daughter cannot obtain possession or  enjoyment of the property without surviving the decedent. Therefore, if  the decedent's reversionary interest immediately before his death  exceeded 5 percent of the value of the property, the value of the  property, less the value of the wife's outstanding life estate, is  includible in the decedent's gross estate.</p><p class="depth2">Example (4). The decedent transferred property in trust with the  income payable to his wife for life and with the remainder payable to  his son or, if the son is not living at the wife's death, to the  decedent or, if the decedent is not then living, to X or X's estate.  Assume that the decedent was survived by his wife, his son, and X. Only  X cannot obtain possession or enjoyment of the property without  surviving the decedent. Therefore, if the decedent's reversionary  interest immediately before his death exceeded 5 percent of the value of  the property, the value of X's remainder interest (with reference to the  time immediately after the decedent's death) is includible in the  decedent's gross estate.</p><p class="depth2">Example (5). The decedent transferred property in trust with the  income to be accumulated for a period of 20 years or until the  decedent's prior death, at which time the principal and accumulated  income was to be paid to the decedent's son if then surviving. Assume  that the decedent does, in fact, die before the expiration of the 20- year period. If, at the time of the transfer, the decedent was 30 years  of age, in good health, etc., the son will be considered able to possess  or enjoy the property without surviving the decedent. If, on the other  hand, the decedent was 70 years of age at the time of the transfer, the  son will not be considered able to possess or enjoy the property without  surviving the decedent. In this latter case, if the value of the  decedent's reversionary interest (arising by operation of law)  immediately before his death exceeded 5 percent of the value of the  property, the value of the property is includible in the decedent's  gross estate.</p><p class="depth2">Example (6). The decedent transferred property in trust with the  income to be accumulated for his life and, at his death, the principal  and accumulated income to be paid to the decedent's then surviving  children. The decedent's wife was given the unrestricted power to alter,  amend, or revoke the trust. Assume that the wife survived the decedent  but did not, in fact, exercise her power during the decedent's lifetime.  Since possession or enjoyment of the property could have been obtained  by the wife during the decedent's lifetime under the exercise of a  general power of appointment, which was, in fact, exercisable  immediately before the decedent's death, no part of the property is  includible in the decedent's gross estate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transfers made before October 8, 1949. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding any  provisions to the contrary contained in paragraphs (a) to (e) of this  section, the value of an interest in property transferred by a decedent  before October 8, 1949, is included in his gross estate under section  2037 only if the decedent's reversionary interest arose by the express  terms of the instrument and not by operation of law. For example, assume  that the decedent, on January 1, 1947, transferred property in trust  with the income payable to his wife for the decedent's life, and, at his  death, remainder to his then surviving descendants. Since no provision  was made for the contingency that no descendants of the decedent might  survive him, a reversion to the decedent's estate existed by operation  of law. The descendants cannot obtain possession or enjoyment of the  property without surviving the decedent. However, since the decedent's  reversionary interest arose by operation of law, no part of the property  is includible in the decedent's gross estate under section 2037. If, in  the above example, the transfer had been made on or after October 8,  1949, and if the decedent's reversionary interest immediately before his  death exceeded 5 percent of the value of the property, the value of the  property would be includible in the decedent's gross estate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The decedent's reversionary interest will be considered to have  arisen by the express terms of the instrument of transfer and not by  operation of law if the instrument contains an express disposition which  affirmatively creates the reversionary interest, even though the terms  of the disposition do not refer to the decedent or his estate, as such.  For example, where the disposition is, in its terms, to the next of kin  of the decedent and such a disposition, under applicable local law,  constitute a reversionary interest in the decedent's estate, the  decedent's reversionary interest will be considered to have arisen by  the express terms of the instrument of transfer and not by operation of  law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Transfers made after November 11, 1935, and before January 29,  1940. The provisions of paragraphs (a) to (f) of this section are fully  applicable to transfers made after November 11, 1935 (the date on which  the Supreme Court decided Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co. (296  U.S. 39) and Becker v. St. Louis Union Trust Co. (296 U.S. 48)), and  before January 29, 1940 (the date on which the Supreme Court decided  Helvering v. Hallock and companion cases (309 U.S. 106)), except that  the value of an interest in property transferred between these dates is  not included in a decedent's gross estate under section 2037 if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commissioner, whose determination shall be final, determines  that the transfer is classifiable with the transfers involved in the St.  Louis Union Trust Co. cases, rather than with the transfer involved in  the case of Klein v. United States (283 U.S. 231), previously decided by  the Supreme Court, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The transfer shall have been finally treated for all gift tax  purposes, both as to the calendar year of the transfer and as to  subsequent calendar years, as a gift in an amount measured by the value  of the property undiminished by reason of a provision in the instrument  of transfer by which the property, in whole or in part, is to revert to  the decedent should he survive the donee or another person, or the  reversion is conditioned upon some other contingency terminable by the  decedent's death.</p>
