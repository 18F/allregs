                            <p class="depth0">Officials shall follow the decision-making process outlined in  paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, when a facility action may  involve floodplain issues. Under certain circumstances, this process may  be carried out with fewer steps if all objectives of the decision-making  process can be achieved. A general principle underlying this process is  that a postal facility action requiring construction in a floodplain may  be considered only when there is no practicable alternative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Analysis of alternatives. If a postal facility action would  involve construction in a floodplain, alternative actions shall be  considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Early public notice. If a facility action at the contending  site(s) could require construction in a floodplain, public notice must  be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Floodplain location and information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Personnel shall  determine whether construction would occur within a floodplain. The  determination shall be made by reference to appropriate Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) floodplain maps (sometimes referred  to as Floodplain Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM)), or Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) maps, or more detailed maps if available. If  such maps are not available, floodplain location must be determined  based on the best available information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Once the preferred site has been identified, potential  floodplain impacts must be determined. As part of this determination  process, specific floodplain information should be developed, which is  to consider:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the proposed action will directly or indirectly support  floodplain development;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Flood hazard and risk to lives and property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Effects on natural and beneficial floodplain values, such as  water quality maintenance, groundwater recharge, and agriculture; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Possible measures to minimize harm to, or impact on, the  floodplain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reevaluation. After the above steps have been followed, if the  determination is that there appears to be no practicable alternative to  constructing in a floodplain, a further review of alternatives must be  conducted by the facilities organization in conjunction with the  operations organization requesting the construction of the facility. The  further review of alternatives must be conducted by the operations  organization for projects within the delegated authority of the Vice  President, Area Operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Final public notice. As a result of the reevaluation, if it is  determined that there is no practicable alternative to constructing in a  floodplain, public notice shall be provided as soon as possible for the  proposed action. The notice should be publicized and should include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the project's location;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provision for a 30-day public commenting period before  irrevocable action is taken by the Postal Service; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Name and complete address of a postal contact person responsible  for providing further information on the decision to proceed with a  facility action or construction project in a floodplain. Upon request,  that person shall provide further information as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of why the proposed action must be located in a  floodplain;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A listing of alternative actions considered in making the  determination; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement indicating whether the action conforms to  applicable state and local floodplain protection standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Distribution. The above public notice will be sent to  appropriate officials, local newspapers, and other parties who express  interest in the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> NEPA coordination. If either an Environmental Impact Statement  or an Environmental Assessment is required under the Postal Service's  National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations, the above review  procedures must be incorporated into and evaluated in that document.</p>
