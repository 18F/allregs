                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in this subpart are issued to implement the  provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). The regulations  relate to all records maintained by the Joint Board for the Enrollment  of Actuaries (Joint Board) which are identifiable by individual name or  identifier and all systems of such records which are retrievable by name  or other identifier. They do not relate to personnel records of  Government employees, which are under the jurisdiction of the Civil  Service Commission, and, thus, subject to regulations issued by such  Commission. The regulations set forth the procedures by which  individuals may request notification of whether the Joint Board  maintains or has disclosed a record pertaining to them or may seek  access to such records maintained in any non-exempt system of records,  request amendment of such records, and appeal any initial adverse  determination with respect to any such request.</p>
