                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in this subpart are issued to implement the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). The regulations relate to all records maintained by the Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries (Joint Board) which are identifiable by individual name or identifier and all systems of such records which are retrievable by name or other identifier. They do not relate to personnel records of Government employees, which are under the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission, and, thus, subject to regulations issued by such Commission. The regulations set forth the procedures by which individuals may request notification of whether the Joint Board maintains or has disclosed a record pertaining to them or may seek access to such records maintained in any non-exempt system of records, request amendment of such records, and appeal any initial adverse determination with respect to any such request.</p>
