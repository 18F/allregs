                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and its  means of opening must be conspicuously marked for the guidance of  occupants using the exits in daylight or in the dark. Such markings must  be designed to remain visible for rotorcraft equipped for overwater  flights if the rotorcraft is capsized and the cabin is submerged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The identity and location of each passenger emergency exit must  be recognizable from a distance equal to the width of the cabin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The location of each passenger emergency exit must be indicated  by a sign visible to occupants approaching along the main passenger  aisle. There must be a locating sign--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Next to or above the aisle near each floor emergency exit,  except that one sign may serve two exits if both exists can be seen  readily from that sign; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft vision  along the passenger cabin, to indicate emergency exits beyond and  obscured by it, except that if this is not possible the sign may be  placed at another appropriate location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign  must have white letters 1 inch high on a red background 2 inches high,  be self or electrically illuminated, and have a   minimum luminescence (brightness) of at least 160 microlamberts. The  colors may be reversed if this will increase the emergency illumination  of the passenger compartment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The location of each passenger emergency exit operating handle  and instructions for opening must be shown--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each emergency exit, by a marking on or near the exit that  is readable from a distance of 30 inches; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each Type I or Type II emergency exit with a locking  mechanism released by rotary motion of the handle, by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A red arrow, with a shaft at least three-fourths inch wide and a  head twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 70 degrees  of arc at a radius approximately equal to three-fourths of the handle  length; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The word ``open'' in red letters 1 inch high, placed  horizontally near the head of the arrow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each emergency exit, and its means of opening, must be marked on  the outside of the rotorcraft. In addition, the following apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There must be a 2-inch colored band outlining each passenger  emergency exit, except small rotorcraft with a maximum weight of 12,500  pounds or less may have a 2-inch colored band outlining each exit  release lever or device of passenger emergency exits which are normally  used doors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each outside marking, including the band, must have color  contrast to be readily distinguishable from the surrounding fuselage  surface. The contrast must be such that, if the reflectance of the  darker color is 15 percent or less, the reflectance of the lighter color  must be at least 45 percent. ``Reflectance'' is the ratio of the  luminous flux reflected by a body to the luminous flux it receives. When  the reflectance of the darker color is greater than 15 percent, at least  a 30 percent difference between its reflectance and the reflectance of  the lighter color must be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exits marked as such, though in excess of the required number of  exits, must meet the requirements for emergency exits of the particular  type. Emergency exits need only be marked with the word ``Exit.''
