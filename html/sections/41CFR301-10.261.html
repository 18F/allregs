                            <p class="depth0">You may use Government aircraft--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For official travel only when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No scheduled commercial airline service is reasonably available  (i.e., able to meet your departure and/or arrival requirements within a  24-hour period, unless you demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances  require a shorter period) to fulfill your agency's travel requirement;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cost of using a Government aircraft is less than the cost of  the city-pair fare for scheduled commercial airline service or the cost  of the lowest available full coach fare if a city-pair fare is not  available to you. The cost of non-productive or lost work time while in  travel status and certain other costs should be considered when  comparing the cost of using a Government aircraft   in lieu of scheduled commercial airline service. Additional information  on costs included in this cost comparison may be found in the ``U.S.  Government Aircraft Cost Accounting Guide,'' available from the General  Services Administration, Office of Governmentwide Policy, MTA, 1800 F  Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20405.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For required-use travel only when you are required to use  Government aircraft for bona fide communications (e.g., 24-hour secure  communications) or security reasons (e.g., highly unusual circumstances  that present a clear and present danger) or exceptional scheduling  requirements (e.g., a national emergency or other compelling operational  considerations). Required use travel may include travel for official,  personal, or political purposes, but must be approved in accordance with  Sec. Sec.  301-10.262(a) and 301-70.803(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For space available travel only when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The aircraft is already scheduled for use for an official  purpose, and your use of the aircraft does not require a larger aircraft  or result in more than minor additional cost to the Government; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You are a Federal traveler or a dependent of a Federal traveler  stationed by the Government in a remote location not accessible to  commercial airline service and authorized to use Government aircraft; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You are authorized to travel on a space available basis under 10  U.S.C. 2648 and regulations implementing that statute.
