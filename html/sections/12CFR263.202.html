The Board shall provide an undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized state member bank or, where appropriate, any company that controls the bank, prior written notice of the Board's intention to issue a directive requiring such bank or company to take actions or to follow proscriptions described in section 38 that are within the Board's discretion to require or impose under section 38 of the FDI Act, including sections 38(e)(5), (f)(2), (f)(3), or (f)(5). The bank shall have such time to respond to a proposed directive as provided by the Board under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The Board shall provide an undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized state member bank or, where appropriate, any company that controls the bank, prior written notice of the Board's intention to issue a directive requiring such bank or company to take actions or to follow proscriptions described in section 38 that are within the Board's discretion to require or impose under section 38 of the FDI Act, including sections 38(e)(5), (f)(2), (f)(3), or (f)(5). The bank shall have such time to respond to a proposed directive as provided by the Board under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Immediate issuance of final directive. If the Board finds it necessary in order to carry out the purposes of section 38 of the FDI Act, the Board may, without providing the notice prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, issue a directive requiring a state member bank or any company that controls a state member bank immediately to take actions or to follow proscriptions described in section 38 that are within the Board's discretion to require or impose under section 38 of the FDI Act, including section 38(e)(5), (f)(2), (f)(3), or (f)(5). A bank or company that is subject to such an immediately effective directive may submit a written appeal of the directive to the Board. Such an appeal must be received by the Board within 14 calendar days of the issuance of the directive, unless the Board permits a longer period. The Board shall consider any such appeal, if filed in a timely matter, within 60 days of receiving the appeal. During such period of review, the directive shall remain in effect unless the Board, in its sole discretion, stays the effectiveness of the directive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of notice. A notice of intention to issue a directive shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the bank's capital measures and capital levels;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the restrictions, prohibitions, or affirmative actions that the Board proposes to impose or require;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proposed date when such restrictions or prohibitions would be effective or the proposed date for completion of such affirmative actions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The date by which the bank or company subject to the directive may file with the Board a written response to the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Response to notice--(1) Time for response. A bank or company may file a written response to a notice of intent to issue a directive within the time period set by the Board. The date shall be at least 14 calendar days from the date of the notice unless the Board determines that a shorter period is appropriate in light of the financial condition of the bank or other relevant circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Time for response. A bank or company may file a written response to a notice of intent to issue a directive within the time period set by the Board. The date shall be at least 14 calendar days from the date of the notice unless the Board determines that a shorter period is appropriate in light of the financial condition of the bank or other relevant circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Content of response. The response should include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An explanation why the action proposed by the Board is not an appropriate exercise of discretion under section 38;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any recommended modification of the proposed directive; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any other relevant information, mitigating circumstances, documentation, or other evidence in support of the position of the bank or company regarding the proposed directive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Board consideration of response. After considering the response, the Board may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Issue the directive as proposed or in modified form;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine not to issue the directive and so notify the bank or company; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Seek additional information or clarification of the response from the bank or company, or any other relevant source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to file response. Failure by a bank or company to file with the Board, within the specified time period, a written response to a proposed directive shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity to respond and shall constitute consent to the issuance of the directive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Request for modification or rescission of directive. Any bank or company that is subject to a directive under this subpart may, upon a change in circumstances, request in writing that the Board reconsider the terms of the directive, and may propose that the directive be rescinded or modified. Unless otherwise ordered by the Board, the directive shall continue in place while such request is pending before the Board.</p>
