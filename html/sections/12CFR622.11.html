An application or request for an order or ruling not  otherwise specifically provided for in this subpart, unless made during  a hearing, shall be made by written motion supported by a memorandum  which concisely states the grounds therefor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Opposition. Within 10 days after service of any written motion,  or within such other period of time as may be fixed by the presiding  officer, any party may file a memorandum in opposition thereto. The  moving party has no right to reply except as permitted by the presiding  officer. The presiding officer has discretion to waive the requirements  of this section as to motions for extension of time and may rule upon  such motions ex parte.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Oral argument. No oral argument will be heard on motions except  as otherwise directed by the presiding officer or the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rulings and orders. Except as otherwise provided in this  subpart, the presiding officer shall rule on all motions and may issue  appropriate orders, except that motions may be referred to the Board if  the presiding officer is unavailable or determines that such motion  should be referred to the Board. Prior to the appointment of a presiding  officer and after a recommended decision is filed pursuant to  Sec. 622.12, the Board shall rule on motions filed by the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Appeal from rulings on motions.

Requests to the Board  for special permission to appeal from a ruling of the presiding officer  shall be filed in writing within 5 days of the ruling, and shall briefly  state the grounds relied on.
