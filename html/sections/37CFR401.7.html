                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Paragraph (k)(4) of the clauses at Sec.  401.14 Implements the  small business preference requirement of 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(7)(D).  Contractors are expected to use efforts that are reasonable under the  circumstances to attract small business licensees. They are also  expected to give small business firms that meet the standard outlined in  the clause a preference over other applicants for licenses. What  constitutes reasonable efforts to attract small business licensees will  vary with the circumstances and the nature, duration, and expense of  efforts needed to bring the invention to the market. Paragraph (k)(4) is  not intended, for example, to prevent nonprofit organizations from  providing larger firms with a right of first refusal or other options in  inventions that relate to research being supported under long-term or  other arrangements with larger companies. Under such circumstances it  would not be resonable to seek and to give a preference to small  business licensees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Small business firms that believe a nonprofit organization is  not meeting its obligations under the clause may report their concerns  to the Secretary. To the extent deemed appropriate, the Secretary will  undertake informal investigation of the concern, and, if appropriate,  enter into discussions or negotiations with the nonprofit organization  to the end of improving its efforts in meeting its obligations under the  clause. However, in no event will the Secretary intervene in ongoing  negotiations or contractor decisions concerning the licensing of a  specific subject invention. All the above investigations, discussions,  and negotiations of the Secretary will be in coordination with other  interested agencies, including the Small Business Administration; and in  the case of a contract for the operation of a government-owned,  contractor operated research or production facility, the Secretary will  coordinate with the agency responsible for the facility prior to any  discussions or negotiations with the contractor.</p>
