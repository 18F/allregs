                            <p class="depth0">As a PVO, you must not limit the number of passengers with a  disability other than individuals with a mobility disability on your  vessel. However, if in the Captain's judgment, weight or stability  issues are presented by the presence of mobility devices and would  conflict with legitimate safety requirements pertaining to the vessel  and its passengers, then the number of passengers with mobility aids may  be limited, but only to the extent reasonable to prevent a avoid such a  conflict.</p>
