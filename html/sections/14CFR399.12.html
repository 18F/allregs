                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is the policy of the Board (jointly with the Department of State) that, as a general rule, landing rights abroad for United States flag air carriers will be acquired through negotiation by the U.S. Government with foreign governments rather than by direct negotiation between an air carrier and a foreign government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is corollary to the foregoing policy that no United States air carrier may avail itself of representations by one foreign government to further its

interest with another foreign government, especially with respect to landing rights, except insofar as such representations have been specifically authorized by the U.S. Government.
