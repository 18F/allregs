                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Timing of the National Service Criminal History Check  Components. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must conduct and review the results of the  nationwide NSOPW check required under Sec. 2540.203 before an  individual in a covered position begins work or starts service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must initiate state registry or FBI criminal history checks  required under Sec. 2540.203 before an individual in a covered position  begins work or starts service. You may permit an individual in a covered  position to begin work or start service pending the   receipt of results from state registry or FBI criminal history checks as  long as the individual is not permitted access to children age 17 years  or younger, to individuals age 60 years or older, or to individuals with  disabilities, without being in the physical presence of an appropriate  individual, as described in Sec. 2540.205(g) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consecutive terms. If an individual serves consecutive terms of  service in a covered position and does not have a break in service that  exceeds 120 days, then no additional National Service Criminal History  Check is required, as long as the original check is a compliant check  for the covered position in which the individual will be serving or  working following the break in service. If your program or project is  designed with breaks in service over 120 days, but less than 180 days  between consecutive terms, you may request approval for a break in  service of up to 180 days before a new National Service Criminal History  Check is required. Your request must describe the overall program  design, explain why the longer period is reasonable, and demonstrate  that you have established adequate risk management controls for the  extended break in service.
