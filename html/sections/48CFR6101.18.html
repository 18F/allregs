                            <p class="depth0">Each party shall inform the Board, in writing, whether it elects a hearing or submission of its case on the record pursuant to 6101.19 (Rule 19). Such an election may be filed at any time unless a time for filing is prescribed by the Board. In most cases, the Board will require the parties to make an election soon after discovery closes. A party electing to submit its case on the record pursuant to 6101.19 (Rule 19) may also elect to appear at a hearing solely to cross-examine any witness presented by the opposing party, provided that the Board is informed of that party's intention within 10 working days of its receipt of notice of the election of hearing by the other party. If a hearing is elected, the election should state where and when the electing party desires the hearing to be held and should explain the reasons for its choices. A hearing will be held if either party elects one. If a party's decision whether to elect a hearing is dependent upon the intentions of the other party, it shall consult with the other party before filing its election. If there is to be a hearing, it will be held at a time and place prescribed by the Board after consultation with the party or parties electing the hearing. The record submissions from a party that has elected to submit its case on the record shall be due as provided in 6101.19 (Rule 19).</p>
