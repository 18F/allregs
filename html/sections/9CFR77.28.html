                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following are accreditation preparatory States: None.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following are accreditation preparatory zones: None.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If any livestock other than captive cervids are included in a  newly assembled herd on a premises where a tuberculous herd has been  depopulated, the State or zone must apply the herd test requirements  contained in the ``Uniform Methods and Rules--Bovine Tuberculosis  Eradication'' (January 22, 1999, edition), which is incorporated by  reference at Sec. 77.1, for such newly assembled herds to those other  livestock in the same manner as to captive cervids. Failure to do so  will result in the removal of the State or zone from the list of  accreditation preparatory States or zones and its being reclassified as  nonaccredited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If tuberculosis is diagnosed within an accreditation preparatory  State or zone in an animal not specifically regulated by this part and a  risk assessment conducted by APHIS determines that the outbreak poses a  tuberculosis risk to livestock within the State or zone, the State or  zone must implement a tuberculosis management plan, approved jointly by  the State animal health official and the Administrator, within 6 months  of the diagnosis. The management plan must include provisions for  immediate investigation of tuberculosis in animals held for exhibition  and in livestock and wildlife; the prevention of the spread of the  disease to other animals held for exhibition and to livestock and  wildlife; increased surveillance for tuberculosis in animals held for  exhibition and wildlife; eradication of tuberculosis from individual  herds; a timeline for tuberculosis eradication; and performance  standards by which to measure yearly progress toward eradication. If a  State or zone does not implement such a plan within the required 6  months, the State or zone will be reclassified as nonaccredited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Accreditation preparatory State or zone status must be renewed  annually. To qualify for renewal of accreditation preparatory State or  zone status, a State must submit an annual report to APHIS certifying  that the State or zone complies with the provisions of the ``Uniform  Methods and Rules--Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication.'' The report must be  submitted to APHIS each year between October 1 and November 30.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To qualify for modified accredited status, an accreditation  preparatory State or zone must demonstrate to the Administrator that it  complies with the provisions of the ``Uniform Methods and Rules--Bovine  Tuberculosis Eradication'' and that tuberculosis has been prevalent in  less than 0.1 percent of the total number of herds of captive cervids in  the State or zone for the most recent year. Except that: The  Administrator, upon his or her review, may allow a State or zone with  fewer than 10,000 herds to have up to 10 affected herds for the most  recent year, depending on the veterinary infrastructure, livestock  demographics, and tuberculosis control and eradication measures in the  State or zone.
