                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A coastal state may use Federal funds to establish and implement  a site selection process which is approved by NOAA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the requirements set forth in subpart I, a  request for Federal funds for site selection must contain the following  programmatic information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the proposed site selection process and how it  will be implemented in conformance with the biogeographic classification  scheme and typology (Sec. 921.3);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An identification of the site selection agency and the potential  management agency; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of how public participation will be incorporated  into the process (see Sec. 921.11(d)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As part of the site selection process, the state and NOAA shall  evaluate and select the final site(s). NOAA has final authority in  approving such sites. Site selection shall be guided by the following  principles:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The site's contribution to the biogeographical and typological  balance of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. NOAA will  give priority consideration to proposals to establish Reserves in  biogeographic regions or subregions or incorporating types that are not  represented in the system. (see the biogeographic classification scheme  and typology set forth in Sec. 921.3 and appendices I and II);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The site's ecological characteristics, including its biological  productivity, diversity of flora and fauna, and capacity to attract a  broad range of research and educational interests. The proposed site  must be a representative estuarine ecosystem and should, to the maximum  extent possible, be an estuarine ecosystem minimally affected by human  activity or influence (see Sec. 921.1(e)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assurance that the site's boundaries encompass an adequate  portion of the key land and water areas of the natural system to  approximate an ecological unit and to ensure effective conservation.  Boundary size will vary greatly depending on the nature of the  ecosystem. Reserve boundaries must encompass the area within which  adequate control has or will be established by the managing entity over  human activities occurring within the Reserve. Generally, Reserve  boundaries will encompass two areas: Key land and water areas (or ``core  area'') and a buffer zone. Key land and water areas and a buffer zone  will likely require significantly different levels of control (see Sec.  921.13(a)(7)). The term ``key land and water areas'' refers to that core  area within the Reserve that is so vital to the functioning of the  estuarine ecosystem that it must be under a level of control sufficient  to ensure the long-term viability of the Reserve for research on natural  processes. Key land and water areas, which comprise the core area, are  those ecological units of a natural estuarine system which preserve, for  research purposes, a full range of significant physical, chemical and  biological factors contributing to the diversity of fauna, flora and  natural processes occurring within the estuary. The determination of  which land and water areas are ``key'' to a particular Reserve must be  based on specific scientific knowledge of the area. A basic principle to  follow when deciding upon key land and water areas is that they should  encompass resources representative of the total ecosystem, and which if  compromised could endanger the research objectives of the Reserve. The  term buffer zone refers to an area adjacent to or surrounding key land  and water areas and essential to their integrity. Buffer zones protect  the core area and provide additional protection for estuarine-dependent  species, including those that are rare or endangered. When determined  appropriate by the state and approved by NOAA, the buffer zone may also  include an area necessary for facilities required for research and  interpretation. Additionally, buffer zones should be established  sufficient to accommodate a shift of the core area as a result of  biological, ecological or geomorphological change which reasonably could  be expected to occur. National Estuarine Research Reserves may include  existing Federal or state lands already in a protected status where  mutual benefit can be enhanced. However, NOAA will not approve a site   for potential National Estuarine Research Reserve status that is  dependent primarily upon the inclusion of currently protected Federal  lands in order to meet the requirements for Reserve status (such as key  land and water areas). Such lands generally will be included within a  Reserve to serve as a buffer or for other ancillary purposes; and may be  included, subject to NOAA approval, as a limited portion of the core  area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The site's suitability for long-term estuarine research,  including ecological factors and proximity to existing research  facilities and educational institutions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The site's compatibility with existing and potential land and  water uses in contiguous areas as well as approved coastal and estuarine  management plans; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The site's importance to education and interpretive efforts,  consistent with the need for continued protection of the natural system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Early in the site selection process the state must seek the  views of affected landowners, local governments, other state and Federal  agencies and other parties who are interested in the area(s) being  considered for selection as a potential National Estuarine Research  Reserve. After the local government(s) and affected landowner(s) have  been contacted, at least one public meeting shall be held in the  vicinity of the proposed site. Notice of such a meeting, including the  time, place, and relevant subject matter, shall be announced by the  state through the area's principal newspaper at least 15 days prior to  the date of the meeting and by NOAA in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A state request for NOAA approval of a proposed site (or sites  in the case of a multi-site Reserve) must contain a description of the  proposed site(s) in relationship to each of the site selection  principals (Sec. 921.11(c)) and the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An analysis of the proposed site(s) based on the biogeographical  scheme/typology discussed in Sec. 921.3 and set forth in appendices I  and II;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the proposed site(s) and its (their) major  resources, including location, proposed boundaries, and adjacent land  uses. Maps are required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the public participation process used by the  state to solicit the views of interested parties, a summary of comments,  and, if interstate issues are involved, documentation that the  Governor(s) of the other affected state(s) has been contacted. Copies of  all correspondence, including contact letters to all affected landowners  must be appended;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A list of all sites considered and a brief statement of the  reasons why a site was not preferred; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A nomination of the proposed site(s) for designation as a  National Estuarine Research Reserve by the Governor of the coastal state  in which the state is located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A state proposing to reactivate an inactive site, previously  approved by NOAA for development as an Estuarine Sanctuary or Reserve,  may apply for those funds remaining, if any, provided for site selection  and feasibility (Sec. 921.11a)) to determine the feasibility of  reactivation. This feasibility study must comply with the requirements  set forth in Sec. 921.11 (c) through (e).</p>
