                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of title 10, U.S.C., as stipulated in section  1001(p) of Public Law 111-5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Closing costs. Sellers' closing costs typically include: loan  payoff fees; the real estate commission; title insurance; all or part of  transfer taxes and escrow fees, if there are any; attorney's fees where  applicable; and other fees set by local custom. HAP pays sellers'  closing costs that are customary for the region where the home is  located. Applicant's realtor or lender can provide the applicant with  the normal closing costs for his/her region. HAP will reimburse the  seller for limited contributions made to the buyer's portion of closing  costs, including appraisal cost and realtor fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deficiency judgment. Judicial recognition of personal liability  under applicable state law against a Service member whose property was  foreclosed on or who otherwise passed title to another person for a  primary residence through a sale that realized less than the full  outstanding mortgage balance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Deployment. Performing service in a training exercise or  operation at a location or under circumstances that make it impossible  or infeasible for the member to spend off-duty time in the housing in  which the member resides when on garrison or installation duty at the  member's permanent duty station, or home port, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Eligible mortgage. A mortgage secured by the primary residence  that was incurred to acquire or improve the primary residence. For a  mortgage refinancing the original mortgage(s) or for a mortgage incurred  subsequent to purchasing the property, funds from the refinanced or  subsequent mortgages must be traced to the purchase of the primary  residence or have been used to improve the primary residence. Home  improvements that are documented (even if not financed through a  subsequent mortgage or line of credit) may be added to the purchase  price of the primary residence. Funds from a refinanced or subsequent  mortgage that were used for other purposes are not eligible and may not  be considered. Benefits will be calculated using the amount of $729,750  for primary residences with an eligible mortgage that exceeds $729,750.  The total benefit payable (excluding allowable closing costs) shall not  exceed $729,750. The ARRA expanded HAP calculates PFMV as the purchase  price plus improvements. Improvements are identified in the Internal  Revenue Publication 523 (http://www.irs.gov/publications/p523/ ar02.html) which outlines items considered home improvements and  distinguishes improvements from repairs and maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Forward deployment. Performing service in an area where the  Secretary of Defense or the Secretary's designee has determined that  Service members are subject to hostile fire or imminent danger under  section 310(a)(2) of title 37, U.S.C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Primary residence. The one- or two-family dwelling from which  employees or members regularly commute (or commuted) to their primary  place of duty. Under Sec. 239.6(a) and (b) of this part, the relevant  property for which compensation might be offered must have been the  primary residence of the member or civilian employee at the time of the  relevant wound, injury, or illness. The first field grade officer (or  civilian equivalent) in the member or employee's chain of command may  certify primary residence status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Prior Fair Market Value (PFMV). The PFMV is the purchase price  of the primary residence. Benefits will be calculated using the amount  of $729,750 as the PFMV for primary residences with a PFMV that exceeds  $729,750.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Purchase. Purchase occurs when the applicant enters into a  contract for the purchase of the property. In the absence of a contract  for purchase, the purchase occurs when the applicant closes on the  property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Reasonable effort to sell. Applicant's primary residence must be  listed, actively marketed, and available for purchase for a minimum of  120 days. With regard to marketing, applicant must demonstrate that the  asking price was within the current market value of the home as  determined by the HQUSACE automated value model (AVM) for no less than  30 days. It is the applicant's responsibility to explain marketing  efforts by detailing how the asking price was gradually reduced until it  reached the true current fair market value (e.g., maintaining a log  containing date and asking price recorded over period of time indicating  number of visits by prospective buyers and offers to purchase). If an  applicant is unable to sell the primary residence, the HQUSACE will  determine whether efforts to sell were reasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Permanent Change of Station (PCS). The assignment or transfer of  a member to a different permanent duty station (PDS), to include  relocation to place of retirement, when retirement is mandatory, under a  competent authorization/order that does not specify the duty as  temporary, provide for further assignment to a new PDS, or direct the  military service member return to the old PDS.</p>
