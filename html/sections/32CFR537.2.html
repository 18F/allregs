                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recovery for government property loss or damage. The FCCA,  originally passed in 1966, gives federal agencies the authority to  collect a claim of the United States government for money or property  arising out of the activities of the agency in question. However, the  broad authority is limited for purposes of this regulation to claims for  loss of or damage to property, as the FMCRA takes precedence for medical  care recoveries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recovery for medical expenses and lost military pay. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  FMCRA, passed in 1962, authorizes recovery from a third person of the  expenses for medical care the United States furnishes to a person who is  injured or suffers a disease when such care is authorized or required by  law. Likewise the United States is authorized to recover the cost of pay  for members of the uniformed services unable to perform duties. Recovery  normally arises out of a third-party tort under local law as to which  the United States has an independent cause of action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under 10 U.S.C. 1095 the United States is also deemed a third- party beneficiary or subrogee under an alternative system of  computations such as workers' compensation; hospital lien laws; contract  rights under the terms of insurance policies including medical payment  coverage; uninsured, underinsured and no-fault coverage; and no-fault  laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recovery of health insurance. 10 U.S.C. 1095 permits recovery of  health insurance for medical care furnished at military medical  treatment facilities (MTFs), including supplemental policies. This  third-party collection program has been delegated to the Surgeon General  of the Army by the Judge Advocate General (TJAG).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Worldwide applicability. The foregoing authorities are worldwide  in application, except for intergovernmental   claims waived by treaty, for example, North Atlantic Treaty Association  Status of Forces Agreement (NATO SOFA), Article VIII, paragraph 1.</p>
