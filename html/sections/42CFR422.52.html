                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. In order to elect a specialized MA plan for a  special needs individual (Special Needs MA plan, or SNP), the individual  must meet the eligibility requirements specified in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basic eligibility requirements. Except as provided in paragraph  (c) of this section, to be eligible to elect an SNP, an individual must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meet the definition of a special needs individual, as defined at  Sec. 422.2;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Meet the eligibility requirements for that specific SNP; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be eligible to elect an MA plan under Sec. 422.50.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exception to Sec. 422.50. CMS may waive Sec. 422.50(a)(2)  concerning the exclusion of persons with ESRD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Deeming continued eligibility. If an SNP determines that the  enrollee no longer meets the eligibility criteria,   but can reasonably be expected to again meet that criteria within a 6- month period, the enrollee is deemed to continue to be eligible for the  MA plan for a period of not less than 30 days but not to exceed 6  months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Restricting enrollment. An SNP must restrict future enrollment  to only special needs individuals as established under Sec. 422.2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Establishing eligibility for enrollment. A SNP must employ a  process approved by CMS to verify the eligibility of each individual  enrolling in the SNP.  [70 FR 4716, Jan. 28, 2005, as amended at 74 FR 1541, Jan. 12, 2009]</p>
