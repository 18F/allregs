                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> DOD Directive 5505.9 and AR 190-53 provide policy for the  wiretap, investigative monitoring and eavesdrop activities by DA  personnel. The recording of telephone communications at MP operations  desks is considered to be a form of command center communications  monitoring which may be conducted to provide an uncontroversial record  of emergency communications. This includes reports of emergencies,  analysis of reported information, records of instructions, such as  commands issued, warnings received, requests for assistance, and  instructions as to the location of serious incidents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following procedures are applicable to the recording of  emergency telephone and/or radio communications at MP operations desks  within the 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, the  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Panama, and Guam.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All telephones connected to recording equipment will be  conspicuously marked ``For Official Use Only-connected to recording  device'' and access to use will be restricted to MP operations desk  personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The connection of voice-recording equipment or private-line  service with the telecommunications network will be in accordance with  applicable telephone company tariffs which permit direct electrical  connection through telephone company recorder-connector equipment. An  automatic audible-tone device is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Official emergency telephone numbers for MP desks will be listed  in appropriate command, activity, or installation telephone directories  with a statement that emergency conversations will be recorded for  accuracy of record purposes. Other forms of pre-warning are not  required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recordings, which contain conversations described in this  section, will be retained for a period of 60 days. Transcripts may be  made for permanent files, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The recording of telephone communications or radio transmissions  by MP personnel for other than emergency purposes is prohibited. If an  investigator requires the use of electronic surveillance equipment,  assistance must be requested from the USACIDC. This policy is  established pursuant to Department of Defense directives that limit such  activity to the criminal investigative organizations of the Services and  DOD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Commanders having general courts-martial convening authority  will issue written authorizations for the recording of emergency  telephone communications at MP operations desks. The letter of  authorization will contain specific authority for the type of equipment  to be used, the phone numbers identified as emergency lines and  instructions limiting recordings to calls received on the phones so  designated. One copy of the authorization will be forwarded to the  Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG), 2800 Army Pentagon,  Washington, DC 20310-2800.</p>
