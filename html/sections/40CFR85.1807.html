                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. The following definitions shall be applicable to  this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> ``Hearing Clerk'' shall mean the Hearing Clerk of the  Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ``Intervener'' shall mean a person who files a petition to be  made an intervener pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section and whose  petition is approved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ``Manufacturer'' refers to a manufacturer contesting a recall  order directed at that manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> ``Party'' shall include the Environmental Protection Agency, the  manufacturer, and any interveners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> ``Presiding Officer'' shall mean an Administrative Law Judge  appointed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3105 (see also 5 CFR part 930 as  amended).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> ``Environmental Appeals Board'' shall mean the Board within the  Agency described in Sec. 1.25 of this title. The Administrator delegates  authority to the Environmental Appeals Board to issue final decisions in  appeals filed under this subpart. Appeals directed to the Administrator,  rather than to the Environmental Appeals Board, will not be considered.  This delegation of authority to the Environmental Appeals Board does not  preclude the Environmental Appeals Board from referring an appeal or a  motion filed under this subpart to the Administrator for decision when  the Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems it appropriate  to do so. When an appeal or motion is referred to the Administrator, all  parties shall be so notified and the rules in this part referring to the  Environmental Appeals Board shall be interpreted as referring to the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Request for public hearing. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the manufacturer disagrees  with the Administrator's finding of nonconformity he may request a  public hearing as described in this section. Requests for such a hearing  shall be filed with the Administrator not later than 45 days after the  receipt of the Administrator's notification of nonconformity unless  otherwise specified by the Administrator. Two copies of such request  shall simultaneously be served upon the Director of the Manufacturers  Operations Division and two copies filed with the Hearing Clerk. Failure  of the manufacturer to request a hearing within the time provided shall  constitute a waiver of his right to such a hearing. In such a case, the  manufacturer shall carry out the recall order as required by  Sec. 85.1803-6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Subsequent to the expiration of the period for requesting a  hearing as of right, the Administrator may, in his discretion and for  good cause shown, grant the manufacturer a hearing to contest the  nonconformity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The request for a public hearing shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement as to which classes or categories of vehicles or  engines are to be the subject of the hearing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the  manufacturer at the hearing for each class or category of engine or  vehicle for which the manufacturer has requested the hearing; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A statement as to reasons the manufacturer believes he will  prevail on the merits on each of the issues so raised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A copy of all requests for public hearings shall be kept on file  in the Office of the Hearing Clerk and shall be made available to the  public during Agency business hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Filing and service. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An original and two copies of all  documents or papers required or permitted to be filed pursuant to this  section shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk. Filing shall be deemed  timely if mailed, as determined by the postmark, to the Hearing Clerk  within the time allowed by this section. If filing is to be accomplished  by mailing, the documents shall be sent to the address set forth in the  notice of public hearing as described in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except for requests to commence a hearing, at the same time a  party files with the Hearing Clerk any additional issues for  consideration at the hearing or any written testimony, documents,  papers, exhibits, or materials, proposed to be introduced into evidence  or papers filed in connection with any appeal, it shall serve upon all  other parties copies thereof. A certificate of service shall be provided  on or accompany each document or paper filed with the Hearing Clerk.  Documents to be served upon the Director of the Manufacturers Operations  Division shall be mailed to: Director, Manufacturers Operations  Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EG-340), 1200  Pennsylvania Ave., NW., WSM,   Washington, DC 20460. Service by mail is complete upon mailing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Time. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed  by this section, except as otherwise provided, the day of the act or  event from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not  be included. Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays shall be  included in computing any such period allowed for the filing of any  document or paper, except that when such period expires on a Saturday,  Sunday, or Federal legal holiday, such period shall be extended to  include the next following business day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A prescribed period of time within which a party is required or  permitted to do an act shall be computed from the time of service,  except that when service is accomplished by mail, three days shall be  added to the prescribed period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Consolidation. The Administrator or the Presiding Officer in his  discretion may consolidate two or more proceedings to be held under this  section for the purpose of resolving one or more issues whenever it  appears that such consolidation will expedite or simplify consideration  of such issues. Consolidation shall not affect the right of any party to  raise issues that could have been raised if consolidation had not  occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Notice of public hearings. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notice of a public hearing under  this section shall be given by publication in the Federal Register.  Notice will be given at least 30 days prior to the commencement of such  hearings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The notice of a public hearing shall include the following  information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The purpose of the hearing and the legal authority under which  the hearing is to be held;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A brief summary of the Administrator's determination of  nonconformity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A brief summary of the manufacturer's basis for contesting the  Administrator's determination of nonconformity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Information regarding the time and location of the hearing and  the address to which all documents required or permitted to be filed  should be sent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The address of the Hearing Clerk to whom all inquiries should be  directed and with whom documents are required to be filed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A statement that all petitions to be made an intervener must be  filed with the Hearing Clerk within 25 days from the date of the notice  of public hearing and must conform to the requirements of paragraph (g)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The notice of public hearing shall be issued by the Assistant  Administrator for Enforcement and General Counsel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Interveners. (1) Any person desiring to intervene in a hearing  to be held under section 207(c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of the Act shall file a petition  setting forth the facts and reasons why he thinks he should be permitted  to intervene.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In passing upon a petition to intervene, the following factors,  among other things, shall be considered by the Presiding Officer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The nature of the petitioner's interest including the nature and  the extent of the property, financial, environmental protection, or  other interest of the petitioner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The effect of the order which may be entered in the proceeding  on petitioner's interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The extent to which the petitioner's interest will be  represented by existing parties or may be protected by other means;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The extent to which petitioner's participation may reasonably  be expected to assist materially in the development of a complete  record;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The effect of the intervention on the Agency's statutory  mandate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A petition to intervene must be filed within 25 days following  the notice of public hearing under section 207(c) (1) of the Act and  shall be served on all parties. Any opposition to such petition must be  filed within five days of such service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All petitions to be made an intervener shall be reviewed by the  Presiding Officer using the criteria set forth in paragraph (g)(2) of  this section and considering any oppositions to such petition. Where the  petition demonstrates that the petitioner's interest   is limited to particular issues, the Presiding Officer may, in granting  such petition, limit petitioner's participation to those particular  issues only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the Presiding Officer grants the petition with respect to any  or all issues, he shall so notify, or direct the Hearing Clerk to  notify, the petitioner and all parties. If the Presiding Officer denies  the petition he shall so notify, or direct the Hearing Clerk to notify,  the petitioner and all parties and shall briefly state the reasons why  the petition was denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> All petitions to be made an intervener shall include an  agreement by the petitioner, and any person represented by the  petitioner, to be subject to examination and cross-examination and to  make any supporting and relevant records available at its own expense  upon the request of the Presiding Officer, on his own motion or the  motion of any party or other intervener. If the intervener fails to  comply with any such request, the Presiding Officer may in his  discretion, terminate his status as an intervener.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Intervention by motion. Following the expiration of the time  prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section for the submission of  petitions to intervene in a hearing, any person may file a motion with  the Presiding Officer to intervene in a hearing. Such a motion must  contain the information and commitments required by paragraphs (g) (2)  and (6) of this section, and, in addition, must show that there is good  cause for granting the motion and must contain a statement that the  intervener shall be bound by agreements, arrangements, and other  determinations which may have been made in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amicus Curiae. Persons not parties to the proceedings wishing to  file briefs may do so by leave of the Presiding Officer granted on  motion. A motion for leave shall identify the interest of the applicant  and shall state the reasons why the proposed amicus brief is desirable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer shall have the duty to  conduct a fair and impartial hearing in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554,  556 and 557, to take all necessary action to avoid delay in the  disposition of the proceedings and to maintain order. He shall have all  power consistent with Agency rule and with the Administrative Procedure  Act necessary to this end, including the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To administer oaths and affirmations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant evidence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To regulate the course of the hearings and the conduct of the  parties and their counsel therein;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To hold conferences for simplification of the issues or any  other proper purpose;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> To consider and rule upon all procedural and other motions  appropriate in such proceedings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> To require the submission of direct testimony in written form  with or without affidavit whenever, in the opinion of the Presiding  Officer, oral testimony is not necessary for full and true disclosure of  the facts. Testimony concerning the conduct and results of tests and  inspections may be submitted in written form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> To enforce agreements and orders requiring access as authorized  by law;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> To require the filing of briefs on any matter on which he is  required to rule;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> To require any party or any witness, during the course of the  hearing, to state his position on any issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> To take or cause depositions to be taken whenever the ends of  justice would be served thereby;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> To make decisions or recommend decisions to resolve the  disputed issues of the record of the hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> To issue, upon good cause shown, protective orders as described  in paragraph (n) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Conferences. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> At the discretion of the Presiding Officer,  conferences may be held prior to or during any hearing. The Presiding  Officer shall direct the Hearing Clerk to notify all parties and  interveners of the time and location of any such conference. At the  discretion of the Presiding Officer, persons other than parties may  attend. At a conference the Presiding Officer may:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Obtain stipulations and admissions, receive requests and order  depositions to be taken, identify disputed issues of fact and law, and  require or   allow the submission of written testimony from any witness or party;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Set a hearing schedule for as many of the following as are  deemed necessary by the Presiding Officer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Oral and written statements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Submission of written direct testimony as required or authorized  by the Presiding Officer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Oral direct and cross-examination of a witness where necessary  as prescribed in paragraph (p) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Oral argument, if appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Identify matters of which official notice may be taken;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Consider limitation of the number of expert and other  witnesses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Consider the procedure to be followed at the hearing; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Consider any other matter that may expedite the hearing or aid  in the disposition of the issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The results of any conference including all stipulations shall,  if not transcribed, be summarized in writing by the Presiding Officer  and made part of the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Primary discovery (exchange of witness lists and documents). </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  At a prehearing conference or within some reasonable time set by the  Presiding Officer prior to the hearing, each party shall make available  to the other parties the names of the expert and other witnesses the  party expects to call, together with a brief summary of their expected  testimony and a list of all documents and exhibits which the party  expects to introduce into evidence. Thereafter, witnesses, documents, or  exhibits may be added and summaries of expected testimony amended upon  motion by a party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Presiding Officer, may, upon motion by a party or other  person, and for good cause shown, by order (i) restrict or defer  disclosure by a party of the name of a witness or a narrative summary of  the expected testimony of a witness, and (ii) prescribe other  appropriate measures to protect a witness. Any party affected by any  such action shall have an adequate opportunity, once he learns the name  of a witness and obtains the narrative summary of his expected  testimony, to prepare for the presentation of his case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Other discovery. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as so provided by paragraph (l) of  this section, further discovery, under this paragraph, shall be  permitted only upon determination by the Presiding Officer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That such discovery will not in any way unreasonably delay the  proceeding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That the information to be obtained is not obtainable  voluntarily; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> That such information has significant probative value. The  Presiding Officer shall be guided by the procedures set forth in the  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, where practicable, and the precedents  thereunder, except that no discovery shall be undertaken except upon  order of the Presiding Officer or upon agreement of the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Presiding Officer shall order depositions upon oral  questions only upon a showing of good cause and upon a finding that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The information sought cannot be obtained by alternative  methods; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is a substantial reason to believe that relevant and  probative evidence may otherwise not be preserved for presentation by a  witness at the hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any party to the proceeding desiring an order of discovery shall  make a motion or motions therefor. Such a motion shall set forth:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The circumstances warranting the taking of the discovery;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The nature of the information expected to be discovered; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The proposed time and place where it will be taken. If the  Presiding Officer determines the motion should be granted, he shall  issue an order for the taking of such discovery together with the  conditions and terms thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Failure to comply with an order issued pursuant to this  paragraph may lead to the inference that the information to be  discovered would be adverse to the person or party from whom the  information was sought.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Protective orders: in camera proceedings. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Upon motion by a  party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, and upon a showing  by the movant that the disclosure of the information to be discovered,  or a particular part thereof, (other than emission data) would result in  methods or processes entitled to protection as   trade secrets of such person being divulged, the Presiding Officer may  enter a protective order with respect to such material. Any protective  order shall contain such terms governing the treatment of the  information as may be appropriate under the circumstances to prevent  disclosure outside the hearing: Provided, That the order shall state  that the material shall be filed separately from other evidence and  exhibits in the hearing. Disclosure shall be limited to parties to the  hearing, their counsel and relevant technical consultants, and  authorized representatives of the United States concerned with carrying  out the Act. Except in the case of the government, disclosure may be  limited to counsel to parties who shall not disclose such information to  the parties themselves. Except in the case of the government, disclosure  to a party or his counsel shall be conditioned on execution of a sworn  statement that no disclosure of the information will be made to persons  not entitled to receive it under the terms of the protective order. (No  such provision is necessary where government employees are concerned  because disclosure by them is subject to the terms of 18 U.S.C. 1905.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A party or person seeking a protective order may be permitted  to make all or part of the required showing in camera. A record shall be  made of such in camera proceedings. If the Presiding Officer enters a  protective order following a showing in camera, the record of such  showing shall be sealed and preserved and made available to the Agency  or court in the event of appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Attendance at any in camera proceeding may be limited to the  Presiding Officer, the Agency, and the person or party seeking the  protective order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any party, subject to the terms and conditions of any protective  order issued pursuant to paragraph (n)(1) of this section, desiring for  the presentation of his case to make use of any in camera documents or  testimony shall make application to the Presiding Officer by motion  setting forth the justification therefor. The Presiding Officer, in  granting any such motion, shall enter an order protecting the rights of  the affected persons and parties and preventing unnecessary disclosure  of such information, including the presentation of such information and  oral testimony and cross-examination concerning it in executive session,  as in his discretion is necessary and practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the submittal of proposed findings, briefs, or other papers,  counsel for all parties shall make a good faith attempt to refrain from  disclosing the specific details of in camera documents and testimony.  This shall not preclude references in such proposed findings, briefs, or  other papers to such documents or testimony including generalized  statements based on their contents. To the extent that counsel consider  it necessary to include specific details in their presentations, such  data shall be incorporated in separate proposed findings, briefs, or  other papers marked ``confidential'', which shall become part of the in  camera record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Motions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All motions, except those made orally during the  course of the hearing, shall be in writing and shall state with  particularity the grounds therefor, shall set forth the relief or order  sought, and shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk and served upon all  parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Within ten days after service of any motion filed pursuant to  this section, or within such other time as may be fixed by the  Environmental Appeals Board or the Presiding Officer, as appropriate,  any party may serve and file an answer to the motion. The movant shall,  if requested by the Environmental Appeals Board or the Presiding  Officer, as appropriate, serve and file reply papers within the time set  by the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Presiding Officer shall rule upon all motions filed or made  prior to the filing of his decision or accelerated decision, as  appropriate. The Environmental Appeals Board shall rule upon all motions  filed prior to the appointment of a Presiding Officer and all motions  filed after the filing of the decision of the Presiding Officer or  accelerated decision. Oral argument of motions will be permitted only if  the Presiding Officer or the Environmental   Appeals Board, as appropriate, deems it necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Evidence. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The official transcripts and exhibits, together  with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, shall constitute  the record. Immaterial or irrelevant parts of an admissible document  shall be segregated and excluded so far as practicable. Documents or  parts thereof subject to a protective order under paragraph (n) of this  section shall be segregated. Evidence may be received at the hearing  even though inadmissible under the rules of evidence applicable to  judicial proceedings. The weight to be given evidence shall be  determined by its reliability and probative value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Presiding Officer shall allow the parties to examine and to  crossexamine a witness to the extent that such examination and cross- examination is necessary for a full and true disclosure of the facts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rulings of the Presiding Officer on the admissibility of  evidence, the propriety of examination and cross-examination and other  procedural matters shall appear in the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Parties shall automatically be presumed to have taken exception  to an adverse ruling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Interlocutory appeal. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An interlocutory appeal may be taken  to the Environmental Appeals Board either (i) with the consent of the  Presiding Officer and where he certifies on the record or in writing  that the allowance of an interlocutory appeal is clearly necessary to  prevent exceptional delay, expense or prejudice to any party or  substantial detriment to the public interest, or (ii) absent the consent  of the Presiding Officer, by permission of the Environmental Appeals  Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applications for interlocutory appeal of any ruling or order of  the Presiding Officer may be filed with the Presiding Officer within 5  days of the issuance of the ruling or order being appealed. Answers  thereto by other parties may be filed within 5 days of the service of  such applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Presiding Officer shall rule on such applications within 5  days of the filing of such application or answers thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Applications to file such appeals absent consent of the  Presiding Officer shall be filed with the Environmental Appeals Board  within 5 days of the denial of any appeal by the Presiding Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The Environmental Appeals Board will consider the merits of the  appeal on the application and any answers thereto. No oral argument will  be heard nor other briefs filed unless the Environmental Appeals Board  directs otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Except under extraordinary circumstances as determined by the  Presiding Officer, the taking of an interlocutory appeal will not stay  the hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> Record. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Hearings shall be stenographically reported and  transcribed, and the original transcript shall be part of the record and  the sole official transcript. Copies of the record shall be filed with  the Hearing Clerk and made available during Agency business hours for  public inspection. Any person desiring a copy of the record of the  hearing or any part thereof shall be entitled to the same upon payment  of the cost thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The official transcripts and exhibits, together with all papers  and requests filed in the proceeding, shall constitute the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(s)</em> Proposed findings, conclusions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Within 20 days of the close  of the reception of evidence, or within such longer time as may be fixed  by the Presiding Officer, any party may submit for the consideration of  the Presiding Officer proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and  a proposed rule or order, together with reasons therefor and briefs in  support thereof. Such proposals shall be in writing, shall be served  upon all parties, and shall contain adequate references to the record  and authorities relied on.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The record shall show the Presiding Officer's ruling on the  proposed findings and conclusions except when his order disposing of the  proceeding otherwise informs the parties of the action taken by him  thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(t)</em> Decision of the Presiding Officer. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Unless extended by the  Environmental Appeals Board, the Presiding Officer shall issue and file  with the Hearing Clerk his decision within 30 days after   the period for filing proposed findings as provided for in paragraph (s)  of this section has expired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Presiding Officer's decision shall become the opinion of the  Environmental Appeals Board (i) when no notice of intention to appeal as  described in paragraph (u) of this section is filed, 30 days after the  issuance thereof, unless in the interim the Environmental Appeals Board  shall have taken action to review or stay the effective date of the  decision; or (ii) when a notice of intention to appeal is filed but the  appeal is not perfected as required by paragraph (u) of this section, 5  days after the period allowed for perfection of an appeal has expired  unless within that 5 day period, the Environmental Appeals Board shall  have taken action to review or stay the effective date of the decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Presiding Officer's decision shall include a statement of  findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor, upon  all the material issues of fact or law presented on the record and an  appropriate rule or order.
