                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> BOP pressure testing timeframes. You must pressure test your BOP system:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When installed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before 14 days have elapsed since your last BOP pressure test. You must begin to test your BOP system before 12 a.m. (midnight) on the 14th day following the conclusion of the previous test. However, the District Manager may require testing every 7 days if conditions or BOP performance warrant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> BOP test pressures. When you test the BOP system, you must conduct a low pressure and a high pressure test for each BOP component. Each individual pressure test must hold pressure long enough to demonstrate that the tested component(s) holds the required pressure. The District Manager may approve or require other test pressures or practices. Required test pressures are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All low pressure tests must be between 200 and 300 psi. Any initial pressure above 300 psi must be bled back to a pressure between 200 and 300 psi before starting the test. If the initial pressure exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero and reinitiate the test. You must conduct the low pressure test before the high pressure test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For ram-type BOP's, choke manifold, and other BOP equipment, the high pressure test must equal the rated working pressure of the equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For annular-type BOP's, the high pressure test must equal 70 percent of the rated working pressure of the equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duration of pressure test. Each test must hold the required pressure for 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For surface BOP systems and surface equipment of a subsea BOP system, a 3-minute test duration is acceptable if you record your test pressures on the outermost half of a 4-hour chart, on a 1-hour chart, or on a digital recorder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the equipment does not hold the required pressure during a test, you must remedy the problem and retest the affected component(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional BOP testing requirements. You must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use water to test the surface BOP system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Stump test a subsea BOP system before installation. You must use water to conduct this test. You may use drilling or completion fluids to conduct subsequent tests of a subsea BOP system. You must perform the initial subsea BOP test on the seafloor within 30 days of the stump test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alternate tests between control stations and pods. If a control station or pod is not functional, you must suspend further completion operations until that station or pod is operable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pressure test the blind or blind-shear ram at least every 30 days;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Function test annulars and rams every 7 days;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Pressure-test variable bore-pipe rams against all sizes of pipe in use, excluding drill collars and bottom-hole tools;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Test affected BOP components following the disconnection or repair of any well-pressure containment seal in the wellhead or BOP stack assembly;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Test all ROV intervention functions on your subsea BOP stack during the stump test. Each ROV must be fully compatible with the BOP stack ROV intervention panels. You must also test and verify closure of at least one set of rams during the initial test on the seafloor through an ROV hot stab. You must submit test procedures, including how you will test each ROV function, with your APM for BSEE District Manager approval. You must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ensure that the ROV hot stabs are function tested and are capable of actuating, at a minimum, one set of pipe rams, one set of blind-shear rams, and unlatching the LMRP;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notify the appropriate BSEE District Manager a minimum of 72 hours prior to the stump test and initial test on the seafloor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Function test autoshear and deadman systems on your subsea BOP

stack during the stump test. You must also test the deadman system and verify closure of at least one set of blind-shear rams during the initial test on the seafloor. When you conduct the initial deadman system test on the seafloor you must ensure the well is secure and, if hydrocarbons have been present, appropriate barriers are in place to isolate hydrocarbons from the wellhead. You must also have an ROV on bottom during the test. You must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submit test procedures with your APM for BSEE District Manager approval. The procedures for these function tests must include documentation of the controls and circuitry of the system utilized during each test. The procedure must also describe how the ROV will be utilized during this operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Postponing BOP tests. You may postpone a BOP test if you have well-control problems. You must conduct the required BOP test as soon as possible (i.e., first trip out of the hole) after the problem has been remedied. You must record the reason for postponing any test in the driller's report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Weekly crew drills. You must conduct a weekly drill to familiarize all personnel engaged in well-completion operations with appropriate safety measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> BOP inspections. (1) You must inspect your BOP system to ensure that the equipment functions properly. The BOP inspections must meet or exceed the provisions of Sections 17.10 and 18.10, Inspections, described in API RP 53, Recommended Practices for Blowout Prevention Equipment Systems for Drilling Wells (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec.  250.198). You must document how you met or exceeded the provisions of Sections 17.10 and 18.10 described in API RP 53, the procedures used, record the results, and make the records available to BSEE upon request. You must maintain your records on the rig for 2 years from the date the records are created, or for a longer period if directed by BSEE.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must inspect your BOP system to ensure that the equipment functions properly. The BOP inspections must meet or exceed the provisions of Sections 17.10 and 18.10, Inspections, described in API RP 53, Recommended Practices for Blowout Prevention Equipment Systems for Drilling Wells (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec.  250.198).
