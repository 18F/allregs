                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Engine and vehicle manufacturers, as well as owners and  operators of vehicles subject to the requirements of this part, and all  other persons, must observe the provisions of this part, the provisions  of the Clean Air Act, and the following provisions of 40 CFR part 1068:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The exemption and importation provisions of 40 CFR part 1068,  subparts C and D, apply for vehicles subject to this part 1037, except  that the hardship exemption provisions of 40 CFR 1068.245, 1068.250, and  1068.255 do not apply for motor vehicles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Manufacturers may comply with the defect reporting requirements  of 40 CFR 1068.501 instead of the defect reporting requirements of 40  CFR part 85.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vehicles exempted from the applicable standards of 40 CFR part  86 are exempt from the standards of this part without request.  Similarly, vehicles are exempt without request if the installed engine  is exempted from the applicable standards in 40 CFR part 86.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The prohibitions of 40 CFR 86.1854 apply for vehicles subject to  the requirements of this part. The actions prohibited under this  provision include the introduction into U.S. commerce of a complete or  incomplete vehicle subject to the standards of this part where the  vehicle is not covered by a valid certificate of conformity or  exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as specifically allowed by this part, it is a violation  of section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7522(a)(1)) to  introduce into U.S. commerce a tractor containing an engine   not certified for use in tractors; or to introduce into U.S. commerce a  vocational vehicle containing a light heavy-duty or medium heavy-duty  engine not certified for use in vocational vehicles. This prohibition  applies especially to the vehicle manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A vehicle manufacturer that completes assembly of a vehicle at  two or more facilities may ask to use as the date of manufacture for  that vehicle the date on which manufacturing is completed at the place  of main assembly, consistent with provisions of 49 CFR 567.4. Note that  such staged assembly is subject to the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.260(c).  Include your request in your application for certification, along with a  summary of your staged-assembly process. You may ask to apply this  allowance to some or all of the vehicles in your vehicle family. Our  approval is effective when we grant your certificate. We will not  approve your request if we determine that you intend to use this  allowance to circumvent the intent of this part.</p>
