                            <p class="depth0">An administrative law judge shall not conduct a hearing if he or she  is prejudiced or partial with respect to any party or has any interest  in the matter pending for decision. If you object to the administrative  law judge who will conduct the hearing, you must notify the  administrative law judge at your earliest opportunity. The  administrative law judge shall consider your objections and shall decide  whether to proceed with the hearing or withdraw. If he or she withdraws,  the Associate Commissioner for Hearings and Appeals, or his or her  delegate, will appoint another administrative law judge to conduct the  hearing. If the administrative law judge does not withdraw, you may,  after the hearing, present your objections to the Appeals Council as  reasons why the hearing decision should be revised or a new hearing held   before another administrative law judge.</p>
