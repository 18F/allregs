                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under Title IV of SMCRA, each Federal fiscal year we must distribute to you, the States and Indian tribes with approved reclamation plans, the moneys listed in this section. We distribute all Fund moneys and other moneys from the Treasury that have been designated for mandatory distribution. We provide information to you showing how we calculated your distribution. We distribute the following moneys:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State share funds to uncertified States as described in Sec. 872.14;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tribal share funds to uncertified Indian tribes as described in Sec. 872.17;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Historic coal funds to uncertified States and Indian tribes as described in Sec. 872.21;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Minimum program make up funds to eligible uncertified States and Indian tribes as described in Sec. 872.26;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prior balance replacement funds to certified and uncertified States and Indian tribes as described in Sec. 872.29; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Certified in lieu funds to certified States and Indian tribes as described in Sec. 872.32.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We calculate annual fee collections for coal produced in the previous Federal fiscal year on a net cash basis.

overpaid or underpaid in prior fiscal years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We distribute any Congressionally-appropriated funds for grants to you out of the Federal expense funds when the appropriation becomes available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may apply for any or all distributed funds at any time after the distribution using the procedures in part 885 of this chapter for certified States and Indian tribes or part 886 for uncertified States and Indian tribes.</p>
