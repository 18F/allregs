Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this provision, the Offeror shall  submit additional cost or pricing data as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Contracting Officer notifies the Offeror that additional  cost or pricing data are required in accordance with paragraph (a) of  this clause, the data shall be certified unless an exception applies  (FAR 15.403-1(b)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions from certified cost or pricing data. In lieu of  submitting certified cost or pricing data, the Offeror may submit a  written request for exception by submitting the   information described in the following paragraphs. The Contracting  Officer may require additional supporting information, but only to the  extent necessary to determine whether an exception should be granted,  and whether the price is fair and reasonable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identification of the law or regulation establishing the price  offered. If the price is controlled under law by periodic rulings,  reviews, or similar actions of a governmental body, attach a copy of the  controlling document, unless it was previously submitted to the  contracting office.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Commercial item exception. For a commercial item exception, the  Offeror shall submit, at a minimum, information on prices at which the  same item or/similar items have previously been sold in the commercial  market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price  for this acquisition.

Provide a copy or describe current discount  policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale,  original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of  each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog  price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent  sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For market-priced items, the source and date or period of the  market quotation or other basis for market price, the base amount, and  applicable discounts.

For items priced using catalog or market prices, or law or  regulation, access does not extend to cost or profit information or  other data relevant solely to the Offeror's determination of the prices  to be offered in the catalog or marketplace.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requirements for certified cost or pricing data. If the Offeror  is not granted an exception from the requirement to submit certified  cost or pricing data, the following applies:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Offeror shall prepare and submit certified cost or pricing  data and supporting attachments in accordance with the instructions  contained in Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408, which is incorporated by  reference with the same force and effect as though it were inserted here  in full text. The instructions in Table 15-2 are incorporated as a  mandatory format to be used, unless the Contracting Officer and the  Offeror agree to a different format.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As soon as practicable after agreement on price, but before  contract award (except for unpriced actions such as letter contracts),  the offeror shall submit a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data,  as prescribed by FAR 15.406-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, the Canadian Commercial Corporation shall obtain and  provide the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Profit rate or fee (as applicable).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Analysis provided by Public Works and Government Services Canada  to the Canadian Commercial Corporation to determine a fair and  reasonable price (comparable to the analysis required at FAR 15.404-1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Data other than certified cost or pricing data necessary to  permit a determination by the U.S. Contracting Officer that the proposed  price is fair and reasonable [U.S. Contracting Officer to provide  description of the data required in accordance with FAR 15.403-3(a)(1)  with the notification].</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>, an offeror who does not  comply with a requirement to submit data that the U.S. Contracting  Officer has deemed necessary to determine price reasonableness or cost  realism is ineligible for award unless the head of the contracting  activity determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to  make the award to that offeror.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If negotiations are conducted, the negotiated price should not  exceed the offered price.</p><p class="depth2">(End of provision)  [78 FR 65217, Oct. 31, 2013]</p>
