                                Sec. 1.1474-1  Liability for withheld tax and withholding agent
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Payment and returns of tax withheld--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A  withholding agent is required to deposit any tax withheld pursuant to  chapter 4 as provided under paragraph (b) of this section and to make  the returns prescribed by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. When  several persons qualify as withholding agents with respect to a single  payment, only one tax is required to be withheld and deposited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Withholding agent liability. A withholding agent that is  required to withhold with respect to a payment under Sec. 1.1471-2(a),  1.1471-4(b) (in the case of a participating FFI), or 1.1472-1(b) but  fails either to withhold or to deposit any tax withheld as required  under paragraph (b) of this section is liable   for the amount of tax not withheld and deposited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use of agents--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in  this paragraph (a)(3), a withholding agent may authorize an agent to  fulfill its obligations under chapter 4. The acts of an agent of a  withholding agent (including the receipt of withholding certificates,  the payment of amounts subject to withholding, the withholding and  deposit of tax withheld, and the reporting required on the relevant  form) are imputed to the withholding agent on whose behalf it is acting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Authorized agent. An agent is authorized only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> There is a written agreement between the withholding agent and  the person acting as agent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A Form 8655, ``Reporting Agent Authorization,'' is filed with  the IRS if the agent (including any sub-agent) is acting as a reporting  agent for filing Form 1042 or making tax deposits and payments;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Books and records and relevant personnel of the agent (including  any sub-agent) are available to the withholding agent (on a continuous  basis, including after termination of the relationship) in order to  evaluate the withholding agent's compliance with the provisions of  chapter 4; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The withholding agent remains fully liable for the acts of its  agent (or any sub-agent) and does not assert any of the defenses that  may otherwise be available, including under common law principles of  agency, in order to avoid tax liability under the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Liability of withholding agent acting through an agent. A  withholding agent acting through an agent is liable for any failure of  the agent, such as a failure to withhold an amount or make a payment of  tax, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the agent's failure  had been the failure of the withholding agent. For this purpose, the  agent's actual knowledge or reason to know shall be imputed to the  withholding agent. Except as otherwise provided in the QI, WP, or WT  agreement, an agent of a withholding agent is subject to the same  withholding and reporting obligations that apply to any withholding  agent under the provisions of chapter 4 and does not benefit from the  special procedures or exceptions that apply to a QI, WP, or WT. If the  agent is a foreign person, however, a U.S. withholding agent may treat  the acts of the foreign agent as its own for purposes of determining  whether it has complied with the provisions of chapter 4. The  withholding agent's liability under paragraph (a)(2) of this section  will exist even if the agent is also a withholding agent and is itself  separately liable for failure to comply with the provisions of chapter  4. The same tax, interest, or penalties, however, shall not be collected  more than once.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Liability for failure to obtain documentation timely or to act  in accordance with applicable presumptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A  withholding agent that cannot reliably associate a payment with  documentation on the date of payment and that does not withhold under  Sec. 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b), or 1.1472-1(b), or withholds at less than  the 30 percent rate prescribed, is liable under this section for the tax  required to be withheld under Sec. 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b), or 1.1472- 1(b) (including interest, penalties, or additions to tax otherwise  applicable in respect of the failure to deduct and withhold) unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The withholding agent has appropriately relied on the  presumptions described in Sec. 1.1471-3(f) in order to treat the payment  as exempt from withholding; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The withholding agent obtained after the date of payment valid  documentation that meets the requirements of Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(7) to  establish that the payment was, in fact, exempt from withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Withholding satisfied by another withholding agent. If a  withholding agent fails to deduct and withhold any amount required to be  deducted and withheld under Sec. 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b), or 1.1472- 1(b), and the tax is satisfied by another withholding agent or is  otherwise paid, then the amount of tax required to be deducted and  withheld shall not be collected from the first-mentioned withholding  agent. However, the withholding agent is not relieved from liability in  any such case for any interest or penalties or additions to tax  otherwise applicable in respect of the failure to deduct and withhold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>, every withholding agent who withholds  tax pursuant to chapter 4 shall deposit such tax within the time  provided in Sec. 1.6302-2(a) by electronic funds transfer as provided  under Sec. 31.6302-1(h) of this chapter. If for any reason the total  amount of tax required to be deposited for any calendar year pursuant to  the income tax return described in paragraph (c) of this section has not  been deposited pursuant to Sec. 1.6302-2, the withholding agent shall  pay the balance of such tax due for such year at such place as the IRS  shall specify. The tax shall be paid when filing the return described in  paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section for such year, unless the IRS specifies  otherwise. See Sec. 1.1471-4(b)(6) for the special rule allowing  participating FFIs to set aside in escrow amounts withheld with respect  to dormant accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for foreign passthru payments and payments of gross  proceeds that include an undetermined amount of income subject to tax.  [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> even if no tax was  required to be withheld for chapter 4 purposes during the preceding  calendar year. The withholding agent must retain a copy of Form 1042 for  the applicable period of limitations on assessment and collection with  respect to the amounts required to be reported on the Form 1042. See  section 6501 and the regulations thereunder for the applicable period of  limitations. Adjustments to the total amount of tax withheld described  in Sec. 1.1474-2 shall be stated on the return as prescribed by the form  and its accompanying instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Participating FFIs, registered deemed-compliant FFIs, and U.S.  branches treated as U.S. persons. A participating FFI or registered  deemed-compliant FFI shall file Form 1042 in accordance with paragraph  (c)(1) of this section to report chapter 4 reportable amounts for which  the participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI is required to  file Form 1042-S, as described in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section.  A participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI with a U.S.  branch that is treated as a U.S. person must exclude from Form 1042  payments made and taxes withheld by such U.S. branch. A U.S. branch that  is treated as a U.S. person shall file a separate Form 1042 in  accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the instructions on  the form to report chapter 4 reportable amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>  must be filed on Form 1042. An amended return must include such  information as the form or its accompanying instructions shall require,  including, with respect to any information that has changed from the  time of the filing of the return, the information that was shown on the  original return and the corrected information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this section, the term recipient under this  paragraph (d) means a person that is a recipient of a chapter 4  reportable amount, and includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> With respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A QI (including a QI that is a foreign branch of a U.S. person);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A WP or WT;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI that  is an NQI, NWP, or NWT (including a U.S. branch of a participating FFI  that is not treated as a U.S. person) and that provides its withholding  agent with sufficient information to determine the portion of the  payment allocable to its reporting pools of recalcitrant account  holders, payees that are nonparticipating FFIs, and payees that are U.S.  persons described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An account holder or payee to the extent that the withholding  agent issues a Form 1042-S to such account holder or payee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An FFI that is a beneficial owner of the payment (including a  limited branch of the FFI);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A U.S. branch of a participating FFI or registered deemed- compliant FFI that is treated as a U.S. person;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A territory financial institution treated as a U.S. person;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> An exempt beneficial owner of a payment, including when the  payment is made to such owner through an FFI (including a  nonparticipating FFI) that provides documentation and information  sufficient for a withholding agent to determine the portion of the  payment allocable to such owner; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Any person (including a flow-through entity) or U.S. branch of  a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI receiving such income that  is (or is deemed to be) effectively connected with the conduct of its  trade or business in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> With respect to a payment other than U.S. source FDAP income.

See paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for reporting  rules applicable if participating FFIs or deemed-compliant FFIs provide  specific payee information for reporting to the recipient of the payment  for Form 1042-S reporting purposes.

A U.S. withholding agent that makes  payments of chapter 4 reportable amounts to an excepted or passive NFFE  shall complete Forms 1042-S treating the NFFE as the recipient, except  when the NFFE is a flow-through entity or acting as an intermediary and  the partner or beneficiary is treated as the payee. In cases in which  the chapter 4 reportable amount is also an amount of U.S. source FDAP  income reportable on Form 1042-S (described in Sec. 1.1441-2(a)), see  also Sec. 1.1461-1(c)(4)(A) for the extent to which reporting is  required with respect to the partners, beneficiaries, or owners of such  entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Nonparticipating FFI that is a flow-through entity or  intermediary.

A participating  FFI or   registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a QI, WP, WT, or U.S. branch  of a participating FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person) may report  in pools consisting of its recalcitrant account holders and payees that  are nonparticipating FFIs. With respect to recalcitrant account holders,  the FFI may report in pools consisting of recalcitrant account holders  within a particular status described in Sec. 1.1471-4(d)(6) and within a  particular income code. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.1471- 4(d)(2)(ii)(F), with respect to payees that are nonparticipating FFIs,  the FFI may report in pools consisting of one or more nonparticipating  FFIs that fall within a particular income code and within a particular  status code described in the instructions to Form 1042-S. Alternatively,  a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a QI,  WP, WT, or U.S. branch of a participating FFI that is not treated as a  U.S. person) may (and a certified deemed-compliant FFI is required to)  perform payee-specific reporting to report a chapter 4 reportable amount  paid to a recalcitrant account holder or a nonparticipating FFI when  withholding was applied (or should have applied) to the payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special reporting requirements of participating FFIs, deemed- compliant FFIs, and FFIs that make an election under section 1471(b)(3).

Such FFI is required to report a payment, however, when the FFI  knows, or has reason to know, that less than the required amount has  been withheld by the withholding agent on the payment or the withholding  agent has not correctly reported the payment on Form 1042-S. In such  case, the FFI must report on Form 1042-S to the extent required under  paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. See, however, Sec. 1.1471- 4(d)(6) for the requirement to report certain aggregate information  regarding accounts held by recalcitrant account holders on Form 8966,  ``FATCA Report,'' regardless of whether withholdable payments are made  to such accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Reporting by a U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person.

Such report must be made on Form 8966 (or such  other form as the IRS may prescribe) and filed on or before March 31 of  the calendar year following the year in which the withholdable payment  was made.
