                                Sec. 90.127  Fuel line permeation from nonhandheld engines and
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The following permeation standards apply to new nonhandheld engines and equipment with respect to fuel lines:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Emission standards and related requirements. New nonhandheld engines and equipment with a date of manufacture of January 1, 2009 or later that run on a volatile liquid fuel (such as gasoline) must meet the emission standards specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New nonhandheld engines and equipment must use only fuel lines that meet a permeation emission standard of 15 g/m\2\/day when measured according to the test procedure described in 40 CFR 1060.515.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternatively, new nonhandheld engines and equipment must use only fuel lines that meet standards that apply for these engines and equipment in California for the same model year (see 40 CFR 1060.810). This may involve SHED-based measurements for equipment or testing with fuel lines alone. If this involves SHED-based measurements, all elements of the emission control system must remain in place for fully assembled engines and equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The emission standards in this section apply with respect to discrete fuel line segments of any length. Compliance may also be demonstrated using aggregated systems that include

multiple sections of fuel line with connectors, and fittings. The standard applies with respect to the total permeation emissions divided by the wetted internal surface area of the assembly. Where it is not practical to determine the wetted internal surface area of the assembly, the internal surface area per unit length of the assembly may be assumed to be equal to the ratio of internal surface area per unit length of the hose section of the assembly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The emission standards in this section apply over a useful life of five years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Starting with the 2010 model year, fuel lines must be labeled in a permanent and legible manner with one of the following approaches:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By meeting the labeling requirements that apply for these engines and equipment in California.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By identifying the certificate holder's corporate name or trademark, or the fuel line manufacturer's corporate name or trademark, and the fuel line's permeation level. For example, the fuel line may identify the emission standard from this section, the applicable SAE classification, or the family number identifying compliance with California standards. A continuous stripe or other pattern may be added to help identify the particular type or grade of fuel line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The requirements of this section do not apply to auxiliary marine engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certification requirements. Fuel lines subject to the requirements in this section must be covered by a certificate of conformity. Fuel line manufacturers or equipment manufacturers may apply for certification. Certification under this section must be based on emission data using the appropriate procedures that demonstrate compliance with the standard, including any of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Emission data demonstrating compliance with fuel line permeation requirements for model year 2008 equipment sold in California. You may satisfy this requirement by presenting an approved Executive Order from the California Air Resources Board showing that the fuel lines meet the applicable standards in California. This may include an Executive Order from the previous model year if a new certification is pending.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Emission data demonstrating a level of permeation control that meets any of the following industry standards:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> R11A specifications in SAE J30 as described in 40 CFR 1060.810.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> R12 specifications in SAE J30 as described in 40 CFR 1060.810.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Category 1 specifications in SAE J2260 as described in 40 CFR 1060.810.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Emission data demonstrating compliance with the fuel line permeation standards in 40 CFR 1051.110.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prohibitions. (1) Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, introducing engines or equipment into U.S. commerce without meeting all the requirements of this section violates Sec. 90.1003(a)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, introducing engines or equipment into U.S. commerce without meeting all the requirements of this section violates Sec. 90.1003(a)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is not a violation to introduce your engines into U.S. commerce if equipment manufacturers add fuel lines when installing your engines in their equipment. However, you must give equipment manufacturers any appropriate instructions so that fully assembled equipment will meet all the requirements in this section, as described in Sec. 90.128.
