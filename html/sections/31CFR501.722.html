Where such a conference is held outside the presence of the Administrative Law Judge, the Administrative Law Judge shall be advised promptly by the parties of any agreements reached. Such conferences also may be held with one or more persons participating by telephone or other remote means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subjects to be discussed.

Unless the Administrative Law Judge orders otherwise, an initial prehearing conference shall be held not later than 14 days after service of an answer.
