Ordinarily, the Secretary would become involved in such  matters only in the context of an election complaint under section 402  and then only if the arrangements for write-in votes were so  unreasonable that the outcome of the election may have been affected. Of  course, a union may, in accordance with its constitution and bylaws or  as a matter of stated policy, refuse to permit write-in votes.</p>
