                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The tax imposed by section 531 applies to any  domestic or foreign corporation (not specifically excepted under section  532(b) and paragraph (b) of this section) formed or availed of to avoid  or prevent the imposition of the individual income tax on its  shareholders, or on the shareholders of any other corporation, by  permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of dividing or  distributing them. See section 533 and Sec. 1.533-1, relating to  evidence of purpose to avoid income tax with respect to shareholders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The tax imposed by section 531 may apply if the avoidance is  accomplished through the formation or use of one corporation or a chain  of corporations. For example, if the capital stock of the M Corporation  is held by the N Corporation, the earnings and profits of the M  Corporation would not be returned as income subject to the individual  income tax until such earnings and profits of the M Corporation were  distributed to the N Corporation and distributed in turn by the N  Corporation to its shareholders. If either the M Corporation or the N  Corporation was formed or is availed of for the purpose of avoiding or  preventing the imposition of the individual income tax upon the  shareholders of the N Corporation, the accumulated taxable income of the  corporation so formed or availed of (M or N, as the case may be) is  subject to the tax imposed by section 531.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. The accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531  does not apply to a personal holding company (as defined in section  542), to a foreign personal holding company (as defined in section 552),  or to a corporation exempt from tax under subchapter F, chapter 1 of the  Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Foreign corporations. Section 531 is applicable to any foreign  corporation, whether resident or nonresident, with respect to any income  derived from sources, within the United States, if any of its  shareholders are subject to income tax on the distributions of the  corporation by reason of being (1) citizens or residents of the United  States, or (2) nonresident alien individuals to whom section 871 is  applicable, or (3) foreign corporations if a beneficial interest therein  is owned directly or indirectly by any shareholder specified in  subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph.</p>
