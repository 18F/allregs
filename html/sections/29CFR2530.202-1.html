                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 202 of the Act and section 410 of the Code contain  minimum participation standards relating to certain employee pension  benefit plans. In general, an employee pension benefit plan may not  require, as a condition of participation in the plan, that an employee  complete a period of service with the employer or employers maintaining  the plan in excess of limits established by section 202 of the Act and  section 410 of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder. Service  for this purpose is measured in units of years of service. Section  2530.202-2 sets forth rules relating to the computation periods which a  plan must use to determine whether an employee has completed a year of  service for purposes of eligibility to participate (``eligibility  computation periods'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For rules relating to ``service with the employer or employers  maintaining the plan'', see Sec. 2530.210.</p>
