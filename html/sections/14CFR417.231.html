                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A flight safety analysis must include a collision  avoidance analysis that establishes each launch wait in a planned launch  window during which a launch operator must not initiate flight, in order  to protect any maned or mannable orbiting object. A launch operator must  account for uncertainties associated with launch vehicle performance and  timing and ensure that any calculated launch waits incorporate all  additional time periods associated with such uncertainties. A launch  operator must implement any launch waits as flight commit criteria  according to Sec. 417.113(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Orbital launch. For an orbital launch, the analysis must  establish any launch waits needed to ensure that   the launch vehicle, any jettisoned components, and its payload do not  pass closer than 200 kilometers to a manned or mannable orbiting object  during ascent to initial orbital insertion through at least one complete  orbit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Suborbital launch. For a suborbital launch, the analysis must  establish any launch waits needed to ensure that the launch vehicle, any  jettisoned components, and any payload do not pass closer than 200  kilometers to a manned or mannable orbital object throughout the flight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Analysis not required. A collision avoidance analysis is not  required if the maximum altitude attainable by a launch operator's  unguided suborbital launch vehicle is less than the altitude of the  lowest manned or mannable orbiting object. The maximum altitude  attainable must be obtained using an optimized trajectory, assuming 3- sigma maximum performance.</p>
