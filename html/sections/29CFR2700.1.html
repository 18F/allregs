                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This part sets forth rules applicable to proceedings  before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (``the  Commission'') and its Administrative Law Judges. The Commission is an  adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate  review of legal disputes arising under the Federal Mine Safety and  Health Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 801 et seq. (``the Act''). The Commission  is an independent agency, not a part of nor affiliated in any way with  the U.S. Department of Labor or its Mine Safety and Health  Administration (``MSHA''). The location of the Commission's headquarters  is at 1331 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Suite 520N, Washington, DC 20004- 1710; its primary phone number is 202-434-9900; and the fax number of  its Docket Office is 202-434-9954. The Commission maintains a Web site  at http://www.fmshrc.gov where these rules, recent and many past  decisions of the Commission and its Judges, and other information  regarding the Commission, can be accessed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless the Commission provides otherwise, amendments to these  rules are effective 60 days following publication in the Federal  Register, and apply to cases initiated after they take effect. They also  apply to further proceedings in cases pending on the effective date,  except to the extent that application of the amended rules would not be  feasible, or would work injustice, in which event the former rules of  procedure would continue to apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability of other rules. On any procedural question not  regulated by the Act, these Procedural Rules, or the Administrative  Procedure Act (particularly 5 U.S.C. 554 and 556), the Commission and  its Judges shall be guided so far as practicable by the Federal Rules of  Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Construction. These rules shall be construed to secure the just,  speedy and inexpensive determination of all proceedings, and to  encourage the participation of miners and their representatives.  Wherever the masculine gender is used in these rules, the feminine  gender is also implied.  [58 FR 12164, Mar. 3, 1993, as amended at 71 FR 44206, Aug. 4, 2006; 77  FR 48430, Aug. 14, 2012]</p>
