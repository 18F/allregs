                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Discrimination prohibited. Except as otherwise provided in this  section, no qualified individual with disabilities shall, because the  Agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with  disabilities, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation  in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or  activity conducted by the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Existing facilities-program access--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Existing facilities  defined. For the purpose of this section, existing facilities means  those facilities owned, leased or used through some other arrangement by  the Agency on March 28, 1990.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> General. The Agency shall operate each program or activity  conducted in an existing facility so that the program or activity, when  viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by  individuals with disabilities. This paragraph does not--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Necessarily require the Agency to make each of its existing  facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Require the Agency to take any action that it can demonstrate  would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or  activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those  circumstances where Agency personnel believe that the proposed action  would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in  undue financial and administrative burdens, the Agency has the burden of  proving that compliance with this paragraph would result in such  alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such  alteration or burdens must be made by the Staff Director or his or her  designee after considering all Agency resources available for use in the  funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be  accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that  conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such  burdens, the Agency shall take any other action that would not result in  such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that  individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the  program or activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Methods. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Agency may comply with the requirements of this  section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of  services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to individuals  with disabilities, delivery of services at alternative accessible sites,  alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities,  use of accessible vehicles, or any other methods that result in making  its program or activities readily accessible to and usable by  individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Agency is not required to make structural changes in  existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving  compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The Agency, in making  alterations to existing buildings to achieve program accessibility,  shall meet accessibility requirements imposed by the Architectural  Barriers Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In choosing among available methods for meeting the  requirements of this section, the Agency shall give priority to those  methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with  disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of  qualified individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Time period for compliance. The Agency shall comply with the  obligations established under this section before April 17, 1990, except  that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes  shall be made before February 16, 1993, but in any event as  expeditiously as possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to  facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the  Agency shall develop, before August 16, 1990, a transition plan setting  forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The Agency shall  provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with  disabilities and organizations representing individuals with  disabilities, to participate in the development of the transition plan  by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition  plan shall be made   available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify physical obstacles in the Agency's facilities that  limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals  with disabilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the  facilities accessible;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve  compliance with this paragraph and, if the time period of the transition  plan is longer than 1 year, identify steps that will be taken during  each year of the transition period; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Indicate the official response for implementation of the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Agency shall provide signs at a primary entrance to each of  its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they  can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international  symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an  accessible facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> New purchases, leases, or other arrangements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any building  or facility acquired after March 28, 1990, whether by purchase, lease  (other than lease renewal), or any other arrangement, shall be readily  accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nothing in this paragraph requires the Agency to take any action  that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the  nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative  burdens. In those circumstances where Agency personnel believe that the  proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or  would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Agency  has the burden of proving that compliance with this paragraph would  result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would  result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Staff Director  or his or her designee after considering all Agency resources available  for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or  activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons  for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an  alteration or such burdens, the Agency shall take any other action that  would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would  nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the  benefits and services of the program or activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> New construction and alterations. Each building or part of a  building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use  of the Agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be  readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities in  accordance with the requirements imposed by the Architectural Barriers  Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157.</p>
