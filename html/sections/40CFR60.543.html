After the initial performance test, the owner or operator may use the most recently determined overall reduction efficiency (R) for the performance test. No monthly performance tests are required.

The average capture efficiency value derived from a minimum of three runs shall constitute a test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For each run, ``i,'' measure the mass of the material containing a single VOC used. This measurement shall be made using a scale that has both a calibration and a readability to within 1 percent of the mass used during the run. This measurement may be made by filling the direct supply reservoir (e.g., trough, tray, or drum that is integral to the operation) and related application equipment (e.g., rollers, pumps, hoses) to a marked level at the start of the run and then refilling to

the same mark from a more easily weighed container (e.g., separate supply drum) at the end of the run. The change in mass of the supply drum would equal the mass of material used from the direct supply reservoir. Alternatively, this measurement may be made by weighing the direct supply reservoir at the start and end of the run or by weighing the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start and end of the run. The change in mass would equal the mass of the material used in the run. If only the direct supply reservoir is weighed, the amount of material in or on the related application equipment must be the same at the start and end of the run. All additions of VOC containing material made to the direct supply reservoir during a run must be properly accounted for in determining the mass of material used during that run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For each run, ``i,'' measure the mass of the material containing a single VOC which is present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run, unless the ending weight fraction VOC in the material is greater than or equal to 98.5 percent of the starting weight fraction VOC in the material, in which case, this measurement is not required. This measurement may be made directly by emptying the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment and then filling them to a marked level from an easily weighed container (e.g. separate supply drum). The change in mass of the supply drum would equal the mass of material in the filled direct supply reservoir and related application equipment. Alternatively, this measurement may be made by weighing the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run and subtracting the mass of the empty direct supply reservoir and related application equipment (tare weight).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For each run, ``i,'' the starting weight fraction VOC in the material shall be determined by Method 24 analysis of a sample taken from the direct supply reservoir at the beginning of the run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For each run, ``i,'' the ending weight fraction VOC in the material shall be determined by Method 24 analysis of a sample taken from the direct supply reservoir at the end of the run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> For each run, ``i,'' in which the ending weight fraction VOC in the material is greater than or equal to 98.5 percent of the starting weight fraction VOC in the material, calculate the mass of the single VOC used (Mi) by multiplying the mass of the material used in the run by the starting weight fraction VOC of the material used in the run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> For each run, ``i,'' in which the ending weight fraction VOC in the material is less than 98.5 percent of the starting weight fraction VOC in the material, calculate the mass of the single VOC used (Mi) as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Calculate the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run by multiplying the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run by the starting weight fraction VOC in the material for that run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calculate the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of the run by multiplying the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of the run by the ending weight fraction VOC in the material for that run. The mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of the run shall be calculated by subtracting the mass of material used in the run from the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The mass of the single VOC used (Mi) equals the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run minus the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of the run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> If Method 25A is used to determine the concentration of the single VOC in the capture system, then calculate the capture efficiency (FCi) for each run, ``i,'' as follows:
