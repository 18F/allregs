The CBP employee shall then await instructions from the Chief Counsel concerning the response to the demand.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requesting party's initial burden. A party seeking CBP information shall serve on the appropriate CBP employee the demand, a copy of the Summons and Complaint, and provide an affidavit, or, if that is not feasible, a statement that sets forth a summary of the documents or testimony sought and its relevance to the proceeding. Any disclosure authorization for documents or testimony by a CBP employee shall be limited to the scope of the demand as summarized in such affidavit or statement. The Chief Counsel may, upon request and for good cause shown, waive the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requesting party's notification requirement.
