A veteran's spouse who resides apart from the  veteran and is estranged from the veteran may not be considered the  veteran's dependent unless the spouse receives reasonable support  contributions from the veteran. (Note that under Sec.  3.60 a veteran  and spouse who reside apart are considered to be living together unless  they are estranged.) A child of a veteran not in custody of the veteran  and to whose support the veteran is not reasonably contributing, may not  be considered the veteran's dependent.

There  is a rebuttable presumption that all of such a child's income is  reasonably available to or for the veteran.

There is a rebuttable presumption that  all of such a child's income is available to or for the surviving  spouse.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1541(c), (g))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reasonable availability and hardship. For the purposes of  paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section, a child's income shall be  considered ``reasonably available'' when it can be readily applied to  meet the veteran's or surviving spouse's expenses necessary for  reasonable family maintenance, and ``hardship'' shall be held to exist  when annual expenses necessary for reasonable family maintenance exceed  the sum of countable annual income plus VA pension entitlement. Expenses  necessary for reasonable family maintenance include expenses for basic  necessities (such as food, clothing, shelter, etc.) and other expenses,  determined on a case-by-case basis, which are necessary to support a  reasonable quality of life.
