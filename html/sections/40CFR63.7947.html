                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As an alternative to the parametric monitoring required in this subpart, you may install, calibrate, and operate a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) to measure the control device outlet total organic emissions or organic HAP emissions concentration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The CEMS used on combustion control devices must include a diluent gas monitoring system (for O2 or CO2) with the pollutant monitoring system in order to correct for dilution (e.g., to 0 percent excess air).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each CEMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. Data must be reduced as specified in Sec. 63.8(g)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must conduct a performance evaluation of the CEMS according to the requirements in Sec. 63.8 and Performance Specification 8 (for a total organic emissions CEMS) or Performance Specification 9 (for a HAP emissions CEMS) and Performance Specification 3 (for an O2 or CO2 CEMS) of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. The relative accuracy provision of Performance Specification 8, sections 2.4 and 3 need not be conducted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must prepare a site-specific monitoring plan for operating, calibrating, and verifying the operation of your CEMS according to the requirements in Sec. Sec. 63.8(c), (d), and (e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must establish the emissions concentration operating limit according to paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> During the performance test, you must monitor and record the total organic or HAP emissions concentration at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average total organic or HAP emissions concentration maintained during the performance test. The average total organic or HAP emissions concentration, corrected for dilution as appropriate, is the maximum operating limit for your control device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must maintain the daily (24-hour) average total organic or HAP emissions concentration in the exhaust vent stream of the control device outlet less than or equal to the site-specific operating limit established during the performance test.</p><p class="depth2">Notification, Reports, and Records</p>
