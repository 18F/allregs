                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When required. Unless you are making a request for notification  of or access to a record in person, and you are personally known to the  SSA representative, you must verify your identity in accordance with  paragraph (b) of this section if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You make a request for notification of a record and we determine  that the mere notice of the existence of the record would be a clearly  unwarranted invasion of privacy if disclosed to someone other than the  subject individual; or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You make a request for access to a record which is not required  to be disclosed to the general public under the Freedom of Information  Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and part 402 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Manner of verifying identity--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Request in person. If you make  a request to us in person, you must provide at least one piece of  tangible identification such as a driver's license, passport, alien or  voter registration card, or union card to verify your identity. If you  do not have identification papers to verify your identity, you must  certify in writing that you are the individual who you claim to be and  that you understand that the knowing and willful request for or  acquisition of a record pertaining to an individual under false  pretenses is a criminal offense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Request by telephone. If you make a request by telephone, you  must verify your identity by providing identifying particulars which  parallel the record to which notification or access is being sought. If  we determine that the particulars provided by telephone are  insufficient, you will be required to submit your request in writing or  in person. We will not accept telephone requests where an individual is  requesting notification of or access to sensitive records such as  medical records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Electronic requests. If you make a request by computer or other  electronic means, e.g., over the Internet, we require you to verify your  identity by using identity confirmation procedures that are commensurate  with the sensitivity of the information that you are requesting. If we  cannot confirm your identity using our identity confirmation procedures,  we will not process the electronic request. When you cannot verify your  identity through our procedures, we will require you to submit your  request in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Electronic disclosures. When we collect or provide personally  identifiable information over open networks such as the Internet, we use  encryption in all of our automated online transaction systems to protect  the confidentiality of the information. When we provide an online access  option, such as a standard e-mail comment form on our Web site, and  encryption is not being used, we alert you that personally identifiable  information (such as your social security number) should not be included  in your message.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Requests not made in person. Except as provided in paragraphs  (b)(2) of this section, if you do not make a request in person, you must  submit a written request to SSA to verify your identify or you must  certify in your request that you are the individual you claim to be. You  must also sign a statement that you understand that the knowing and  willful request for or acquisition of a record pertaining to an  individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Requests on behalf of another. If you make a request on behalf  of a minor or legal incompetent as authorized under Sec. 401.40, you  must verify your relationship to the minor or legal incompetent, in  addition to verifying your own identity, by providing a copy of the  minor's birth certificate, a court order, or other competent evidence of  guardianship to SSA; except that you are not required to verify your  relationship to the minor or legal incompetent when you are not required  to verify your own identity or when evidence of your relationship to the  minor or legal incompetent has been previously given to SSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Medical records--additional verification. You need to further  verify your identity if you are requesting notification of or access to  sensitive records such as medical records. Any information for further  verification must parallel the information in the record to which  notification or access is being sought. Such further verification may  include such particulars as the date or place of birth, names of  parents, name of employer or the specific times the individual received  medical treatment.
