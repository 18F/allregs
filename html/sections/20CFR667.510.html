                                Sec. 667.510  What is the Grant Officer resolution process?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. When the Grant Officer is dissatisfied with the State's  disposition of an audit or other resolution of violations (including  those arising out of incident reports or compliance reviews), or with  the recipient's response to findings resulting from investigations or  monitoring report, the initial and final determination process, set  forth in this section, is used to resolve the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial determination. The Grant Officer makes an initial  determination on the findings for both those matters where there is  agreement and those where there is disagreement with the recipient's  resolution, including the allowability of questioned costs or  activities. This initial determination is based upon the requirements of  the Act and regulations, and the terms and conditions of the grants,  contracts, or other agreements under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Informal resolution. Except in an emergency situation, when the  Secretary invokes the authority described in WIA section 184(e), the  Grant Officer may not revoke a recipient's grant in whole or in part,  nor institute corrective actions or sanctions, without first providing  the recipient with an opportunity to present documentation or arguments  to resolve informally those matters in controversy contained in the  initial determination. The initial determination must provide for an  informal resolution period of at least 60 days from issuance of the  initial determination. If the matters are resolved informally, the Grant  Officer must   issue a final determination under paragraph (d) of this section which  notifies the parties in writing of the nature of the resolution and may  close the file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Grant Officer's final determination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the matter is not  fully resolved informally, the Grant Officer provides each party with a  written final determination by certified mail, return receipt requested.  For audits of recipient-level entities and other recipients which  receive WIA funds directly from DOL, ordinarily, the final determination  is issued not later than 180 days from the date that the Office of  Inspector General (OIG) issues the final approved audit report to the  Employment and Training Administration. For audits of subrecipients  conducted by the OIG, ordinarily the final determination is issued not  later than 360 days from the date the OIG issues the final approved  audit report to ETA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A final determination under this paragraph (d) must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Indicate whether efforts to informally resolve matters contained  in the initial determination have been unsuccessful;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> List those matters upon which the parties continue to disagree;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> List any modifications to the factual findings and conclusions  set forth in the initial determination and the rationale for such  modifications;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Establish a debt, if appropriate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Require corrective action, when needed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Determine liability, method of restitution of funds and  sanctions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Offer an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with Sec.  667.800 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless a hearing is requested, a final determination under this  paragraph (d) is final agency action and is not subject to further  review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Nothing in this subpart precludes the Grant Officer from issuing  an initial determination and/or final determination directly to a  subrecipient, in accordance with section 184(d)(3) of the Act. In such a  case, the Grant Officer will inform the recipient of this action.</p>
