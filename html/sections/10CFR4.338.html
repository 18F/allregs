If another recipient  exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, NRC may  require both recipients to take remedial action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, a recipient  may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that  resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity  on the basis of age.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a recipient, operating a program that serves the elderly or  children in addition to persons of other ages, provides special benefits  to the elderly or to children, the provision of those benefits shall be  presumed to be voluntary affirmative action provided that it does not  have the effect of excluding otherwise eligible persons from  participation in the program or activity.
