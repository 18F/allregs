                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cost recovery fees--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Responsibility. The person documented on  the rockfish CQ permit as the permit holder at the time of a rockfish CQ  landing must comply with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subsequent transfer of rockfish CQ or rockfish QS held by  rockfish cooperative members does not affect the rockfish CQ permit  holder's liability for noncompliance with this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Non-renewal of a rockfish CQ permit does not affect the CQ  permit holder's liability for noncompliance with this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Changes in the membership in a rockfish cooperative, such as  members joining or departing during the relevant year, or changes in the  amount of rockfish QS holdings of those members does not affect the  rockfish CQ permit holder's liability for noncompliance with this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fee collection. All rockfish CQ holders who receive rockfish CQ  are responsible for submitting the cost recovery payment for all  rockfish CQ landings made under the authority of their rockfish CQ  permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Payment--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Payment due date. A rockfish CQ permit holder must  submit any rockfish cost recovery fee liability payment(s) to NMFS at  the address provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section no later  than February 15 of the year following the calendar year in which the  rockfish CQ landings were made.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Payment recipient. Make electronic payment payable to NMFS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Payment address. Submit payment and related documents as  instructed on the fee submission form. Payments must be made  electronically through the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at http:// alaskafisheries.noaa.gov. Instructions for electronic payment will be  made available on both the payment Web site and a fee liability summary  letter mailed to the CQ permit holder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Payment method. Payment must be made electronically in U.S.  dollars by automated clearing house, credit card, or electronic check  drawn on a U.S. bank account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rockfish standard ex-vessel value determination and use--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  General. A CQ permit holder must use the rockfish standard ex-vessel  value determined by NMFS under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rockfish standard ex-vessel value--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General. Each year the  Regional Administrator will publish rockfish standard ex-vessel values  in the Federal Register during the first quarter of each calendar year.  The standard prices will be described in U.S. dollars per equivalent  pound, for rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species  landings made by rockfish CQ holders during the previous calendar year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Effective duration. The rockfish standard ex-vessel value  published by NMFS shall apply to all rockfish primary species and  rockfish secondary species landings made by a rockfish CQ holder during  the previous calendar year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Determination. NMFS will calculate the rockfish standard ex- vessel value to reflect, as closely as possible by month, the variations  in the actual ex-vessel values of landings based on   information provided in the Rockfish Ex-vessel Volume and Value Report  as described in Sec. 679.5(r)(10). The Regional Administrator will base  rockfish standard ex-vessel values on the following types of  information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Landed pounds by rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary  species landings and month;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Total ex-vessel value by rockfish primary species and rockfish  secondary species landings and month; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Price adjustments, including retroactive payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rockfish fee percentage--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Established percentage. The  rockfish fee percentage is the amount as determined by the factors and  methodology described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This amount  will be announced by publication in the Federal Register in accordance  with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. This amount must not exceed 3.0  percent pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1854(d)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculating fee percentage value. Each year NMFS shall calculate  and publish the fee percentage according to the following factors and  methodology:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Factors. NMFS must use the following factors to determine the  fee percentage:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The catch to which the rockfish cost recovery fee will apply;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The ex-vessel value of that catch; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The costs directly related to the management, data collection,  and enforcement of the Rockfish Program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Methodology. NMFS must use the following equations to determine  the fee percentage:  100 x DPC/V  where: DPC = the direct program costs for the Rockfish Program for the previous</p><p class="depth4">calendar year with any adjustments to the account from</p><p class="depth4">payments received in the previous year. V = total of the standard ex-vessel value of the catch subject to the</p><p class="depth4">rockfish cost recovery fee liability for the current year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Publication--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General. During the first quarter of the year  following the calendar year in which the rockfish CQ landings were made,  NMFS shall calculate the rockfish fee percentage based on the  calculations described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Effective period. The calculated rockfish fee percentage is  applied to rockfish CQ landings made in the previous calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Applicable percentage. The CQ permit holder must use the  rockfish fee percentage applicable at the time a rockfish primary  species and rockfish secondary species landing is debited from a  rockfish CQ allocation to calculate the rockfish cost recovery fee  liability for any retroactive payments for that rockfish primary species  and rockfish secondary species.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Fee liability determination for a rockfish CQ holder. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All  rockfish CQ holders will be subject to a fee liability for any rockfish  primary species and rockfish secondary species CQ debited from a  rockfish CQ allocation during a calendar year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The rockfish fee liability assessed to a rockfish CQ holder  will be based on the proportion of the standard ex-vessel value of  rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species debited from a  rockfish CQ holder relative to all rockfish CQ holders during a calendar  year as determined by NMFS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> NMFS will provide a fee liability summary letter to all CQ  permit holders during the first quarter of the year following the  calendar year in which the rockfish CQ landings were made. The summary  will explain the fee liability determination including the current fee  percentage, details of rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary  species CQ pounds debited from rockfish CQ allocations by permit,  species, date, and prices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Underpayment of fee liability. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 679.81(f),  no rockfish CQ holder will receive any rockfish CQ until the rockfish CQ  holder submits a complete application. A complete application shall  include full payment of an applicant's complete rockfish cost recovery  fee liability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a rockfish CQ holder fails to submit full payment for  rockfish cost recovery fee liability by the date described in paragraph  (a)(3) of this section, the Regional Administrator may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At any time thereafter send an IAD to the CQ permit holder  stating that the CQ permit holder's estimated fee liability, as  indicated by his or her own submitted information, is the   rockfish cost recovery fee liability due from the CQ permit holder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Disapprove any application to transfer rockfish CQ to or from  the CQ permit holder in accordance with Sec. 679.81(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No CQ permit will be issued to that rockfish CQ holder for that  calendar year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No rockfish CQ will be issued based on the rockfish QS held by  the members of that rockfish cooperative to any other CQ permit for that  calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon final agency action determining that a CQ permit holder has  not paid his or her rockfish cost recovery fee liability, the Regional  Administrator may continue to prohibit issuance of a CQ permit for any  subsequent calendar years until NMFS receives the unpaid fees. If  payment is not received by the 30th day after the final agency action,  the agency may pursue collection of the unpaid fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Over payment. Upon issuance of final agency action, payment  submitted to NMFS in excess of the rockfish cost recovery fee liability  determined to be due by the final agency action will be returned to the  CQ permit holder unless the permit holder requests the agency to credit  the excess amount against the permit holder's future rockfish cost  recovery fee liability. Payment processing fees may be deducted from any  fees returned to the CQ permit holder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Appeals. A CQ permit holder who receives an IAD for incomplete  payment of a rockfish fee liability may appeal the IAD pursuant to 50  CFR 679.43.</p>
