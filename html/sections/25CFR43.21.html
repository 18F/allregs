                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Records shall contain only information about an individual which  is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Bureau required  to be accomplished by statute or Executive order of the President.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Student records which are used in making any determination about  any student shall be maintained with such accuracy, relevance,  timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure  fairness to the student in making the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information which may be used in determining a student's rights,  benefits, and privileges under Federal programs shall be collected  directly from the student or his parents, to the greatest extent  practicable. In deciding whether collection of information from a parent  or eligible student, as opposed to a third-party source is practicable,  the following factors among others may be considered:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the nature of the information sought is such that it can  only be obtained from a third party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the cost of collecting the information from the parent  or student is unreasonable, when compared with the cost of collecting it  from a third party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether there is a risk that information collected from third  parties, if inaccurate, could result in an adverse determination to the  student concerned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the information, if supplied by the parent or student,  would have to be verified by a third party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether provisions can be made for verification by the parent of  student of information collected from third parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each individual parent or eligible student who is asked to  supply information about himself which will be added to a system of  student records shall be notified of the basis for requesting the  information, how it may be used, and what the consequences, if any, are  of not supplying the information. At a minimum, the notice to the parent  or eligible student must state:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The authority (whether granted by statute or Executive Order of  the President) which authorizes requesting the information and whether  disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The principle purpose or purposes for which the information is  intended to be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The routine uses which may be made of the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The effects, if any, of not providing all or any part of the  requested information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When information is collected on a standard form, the notice to  the parent or eligible student shall be on the form or on a tear-off  sheet attached to the form or on a separate sheet, whichever, is most  practical.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When information is collected by an interviewer, the interviewer  shall provide the parent or eligible student with a written notice which  the individual may retain. If the interview is conducted by telephone,  however, the interviewer may summarize the notice for the individual and  need not provide a copy to the individual unless the individual requests  that a copy be mailed to him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A parent or eligible student may be asked to acknowledge, in  writing, that he has been given the notice required by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> No student records may be maintained describing how any  individual exercises rights guaranteed by the first amendment to the  Constitution unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom  the student record is maintained; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law  enforcement activity.</p>
