                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It may be found cost effective for a State transportation  department or   county to undertake a federally financed highway construction project by  force account when a situation exists in which the rights or  resposibilities of the community at large are so affected as to require  some special course of action, including situations where there is a  lack of bids or the bids received are unreasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, it is hereby  determined that by reason of the inherent nature of the operations  involved, it is cost effective to perform by force account the  adjustment of railroad or utility facilities and similar types of  facilities owned or operated by a public agency, a railroad, or a  utility company provided that the organization is qualified to perform  the work in a satisfactory manner. The installation of new facilities  shall be undertaken by competitive bidding except as provided in Sec.  635.204(c). Adjustment of railroad facilities shall include minor work  on the railroad's operating facilities routinely performed by the  railroad with its own forces such as the installation of grade crossing  warning devices, crossing surfaces, and minor track and signal work.  Adjustment of utility facilities shall include minor work on the  utility's existing facilities routinely performed by the utility with  its own forces and includes minor installations of new facilities to  provide power, minor lighting, telephone, water and similar utility  service to a rest area, weigh-station, movable bridge, or other highway  appurtenance, provided such installation cannot feasibly be done as  incidental to a major installation project such as an extensive highway  lighting system.
