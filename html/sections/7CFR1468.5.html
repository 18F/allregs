Conservation  practices in the conservation farm plan that would have been eligible  for payment under CRP, EQIP, or cost-share agreements under WRP are  eligible for CFO payment. The provisions for determining eligibility for  payment and the calculation of payment under CFO will be similar to  those specified for the eligible conservation practices under CRP, EQIP,  or cost-share agreements under WRP. For land retirement payments, the  CRP payment schedule in effect for the applicable soils at the time the  CFO contract is signed will be utilized. CCC will provide annual  payments to a participant for such conservation practices as specified  in the time schedule set forth in the conservation farm plan.</p>
