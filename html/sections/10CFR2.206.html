Electronic submissions must be made in a manner that enables the NRC to  receive, read, authenticate, distribute, and archive the submission, and  process and retrieve it a single page at a time. Detailed guidance on  making electronic submissions can be obtained by visiting the NRC's Web  site at http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html; by e-mail to  MSHD.Resource@nrc.gov; or by writing the Office of Information Services,  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001.
