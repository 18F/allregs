                            <p class="depth0">Section 15(b) of the CPSA requires subject firms to report when they obtain information which reasonably supports the conclusion that products they distributed in commerce fail to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule or with a voluntary consumer product safety standard upon which the Commission has relied under section 9 of the CPSA, contain a defect which could create a substantial product hazard, or create an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. The Commission's rules interpreting this provision are set forth at 16 CFR part 1115. The requirements of section 102 of the CSPA and this part are in addition to, but not to the exclusion of, the requirements in section 15(b) and part 1115. To comply with section 15(b), subject firms must continue to evaluate safety information they obtain about their products. Subject firms may have an obligation to report under section 15(b) of the CPSA whether or not they obtain information about choking incidents. Firms must also comply with the lawsuit-reporting provisions of section 37 of the CPSA, interpreted at 16 CFR part 1116.</p>
