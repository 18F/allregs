If other matter in such document is in such bulk or extent as would necessarily encumber the record, such document will not be received in evidence, but may be marked for identification, and if properly authenticated, the relevant and material parts thereof may be read into the record, or if the Administrative Law Judge so directs, a true copy of such matter in proper form shall be received in evidence as an exhibit, and copies shall be delivered by the participant offering the same to the other parties or their attorneys appearing at the hearing, who shall be afforded an opportunity to examine the entire document and to offer in evidence in like manner other material and relevant portions thereof.
