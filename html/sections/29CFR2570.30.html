                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The rules of procedure set forth in this subpart apply to  prohibited transaction exemptions issued by the Department under the  authority of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 408(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of  1974 (ERISA);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the  Code); \1\ or ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\1\ Section 102 of Presidential Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (3  CFR part 332 (1978), reprinted in 5 U.S.C. app. at 672 (2006), and in 92  Stat. 3790 (1978)), effective December 31, 1978, generally transferred  the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue administrative  exemptions under section 4975(c)(2) of the Code to the Department of  Labor. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3))</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under these rules of procedure, the Department may conditionally  or unconditionally exempt any fiduciary or transaction, or class of  fiduciaries or transactions, from all or part of the restrictions  imposed by section 406 of ERISA and the corresponding restrictions of  the Code and FERSA. While administrative exemptions granted   under these rules are ordinarily prospective in nature, an applicant may  also obtain retroactive relief for past prohibited transactions if  certain safeguards described in this subpart were in place at the time  the transaction was consummated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> These rules govern the filing and processing of applications for  both individual and class exemptions that the Department may propose and  grant pursuant to the authorities cited in paragraph (a) of this  section. The Department may also propose and grant exemptions on its own  motion, in which case the procedures relating to publication of notices,  hearings, evaluation and public inspection of the administrative record,  and modification or revocation of previously granted exemptions will  apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The issuance of an administrative exemption by the Department  under these procedural rules does not relieve a fiduciary or other party  in interest or disqualified person with respect to a plan from the  obligation to comply with certain other provisions of ERISA, the Code,  or FERSA, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the  exemption does not apply, and the general fiduciary responsibility  provisions of ERISA which require, among other things, that a fiduciary  discharge his or her duties respecting the plan solely in the interests  of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent  fashion; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the  Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the  employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Department will not propose or issue exemptions upon oral  request alone, nor will the Department grant exemptions orally. An  applicant for an administrative exemption may request and receive oral  advice from Department employees in preparing an exemption application.  However, such advice does not constitute part of the administrative  record and is not binding on the Department in its processing of an  exemption application or in its examination or audit of a plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Department will generally treat any exemption application  that is filed solely under section 408(a) of ERISA or solely under  section 4975(c)(2) of the Code as an exemption request filed under both  section 408(a) and section 4975(c)(2) if it relates to a transaction  that would be prohibited both by ERISA and the corresponding provisions  of the Code.</p>
