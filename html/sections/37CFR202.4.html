                            <p class="depth0">The effective date of registration for claims received in the  Copyright Office on or after January 3, 1991, and through December 31,  1991, with a short fee of $10 is the date on which the application,  deposit, and $10 fee have all been received in the Copyright Office,  provided, the claim is later determined to be acceptable for  registration by the Register of Copyrights and a supplementary fee of  $10 is received in the Copyright Office. If the supplementary   fee is not received promptly after notification of the short fee, the  Copyright Office will initiate a proceeding to cancel the copyright  registration. If the supplementary fee of $10 is not received in the  Copyright Office before the cancellation proceeding is completed, the  cancellation will become final and will result in the loss of the  effective date of registration. After cancellation, registration could  be obtained only by submitting a new application, deposit, and filing  fee.  [55 FR 50001, Dec. 4, 1990]</p>
