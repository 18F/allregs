                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section sets forth the policies and  procedures of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan  Reconstruction (SIGAR or the agency) regarding the testimony of  employees and former employees as witnesses and the production or  disclosure of SIGAR documents or information for use in legal  proceedings in which the United States is not a party and where the  demand is pursuant to a subpoena, order or request (collectively  referred to in this section as a ``demand'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This section does not apply to any legal proceeding in which an  employee is to testify while on leave status regarding facts or events  that are unrelated to the official business of SIGAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Nothing in this section affects the rights and procedures  governing public access to agency records pursuant to the Freedom of  Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Demands in legal proceedings in which the United States is not  a party for the production of SIGAR records or information, or for the  testimony of SIGAR employees, regarding information or documents that  are protected by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), the Trade Secrets Act  (18 U.S.C. 1905) or other statutes, must satisfy the requirements for  disclosure set forth in those statutes and the applicable regulations of  this part, before the records may be provided or testimony given.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This section is intended to provide guidance for the internal  operations of SIGAR and to inform the public about SIGAR procedures  concerning service of process upon SIGAR and its responses to demands.  The procedures specified in this section, or the failure of any SIGAR  employee to follow the procedures specified in this section, are not  intended to, do not, and may not be relied upon to create a right or  benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party  against the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Agency counsel means: SIGAR's General Counsel or his or her  designee.</p><p class="depth2">Demand means a subpoena, order or request for testimony, documents  or information related to, or for possible use in, a legal proceeding in  which the United States is not a party.</p><p class="depth2">Document means any record or other property, no matter what media,  and including copies thereof, held by SIGAR, including without  limitation, letters, Emails, telegrams, memoranda, facsimiles, reports,  studies, calendar and diary entries, maps, graphs, pamphlets, notes,  charts, tabulations, analyses, statistical or informational  accumulations, summaries of meetings and conversations, film  impressions, magnetic tapes and sound or mechanical reproductions.</p><p class="depth2">Employee means all employees or officers of SIGAR, including (for  the purpose of this section only) contractors and any other individuals  who have been appointed by, or are subject to the supervision,  jurisdiction or control of SIGAR. The procedures established within this  subpart also apply to former employees of SIGAR where specifically  stated in this section.</p><p class="depth2">General Counsel means the General Counsel of SIGAR.</p><p class="depth2">Legal proceeding means all pretrial, trial and post-trial stages of  all judicial or administrative actions, hearings, investigations,  arbitrations or similar proceedings before courts, commissions, boards,  grand juries, or other tribunals, foreign or domestic. This term  includes all phases of discovery as well as responses to informal  requests by attorneys or others involved in legal proceedings seeking  interviews or the like.</p><p class="depth2">Official business means the authorized business of SIGAR as stated  in the ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008,'' Pub.  L. 110-181 (Jan. 28, 2008), Section 1229 (122 Stat. 378-85), as amended,  and Section 842 (122 Stat. 234-36), 10 U.S.C. 2302 note.</p><p class="depth2">Testimony means an employee's statement in any form, including  testifying before a court or other tribunal or board, giving  depositions, interviews, telephonic, televised, videoconference or  videotaped statements, and providing written responses to  interrogatories, admission requests or other discovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> SIGAR policy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SIGAR was established by Section 1229 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Public Law 110- 181 (January 28, 2008), as a wartime or overseas contingency operation  oversight agency of the United States Government's Executive Branch.  SIGAR's Inspector General is appointed by the President of the United  States. See Pub. L. 110-181, Section 1229(c). SIGAR performs oversight  of Afghanistan reconstruction and security programs, operations and  contracts to prevent and detect waste, fraud and abuse pursuant to  Sections 1229 and 842 of Public Law 110-181. The records of an inspector  general frequently contain sensitive law enforcement information that is  protected from disclosure or obtained under guarantees of  confidentiality.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In appropriate cases, the agency counsel shall notify the United  States Department of Justice (DOJ) of the demand and coordinate with the  DOJ to file any appropriate motions or other pleadings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No current or former employee shall, in response to a demand,  produce any SIGAR documents, provide testimony regarding any information  relating to or based upon SIGAR documents, or disclose any information  or produce materials acquired as part of the performance of that  employee's official duties or official status, in a legal proceeding in  which the United States is not a party, without the prior written  authorization of the General Counsel. See United States ex rel. Touhy v.  Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951); and 5 U.S.C. 301 (``The head of an Executive  department or military department may prescribe regulations for the  government of his department, the conduct of its employees, the  distribution and performance of its business, and the custody, use, and  preservation of its records, papers, and property. This section does not  authorize withholding information from the public or limiting the  availability of records to the public.'')</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures for demand for testimony or production of documents.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written demand directed to SIGAR for the testimony of a SIGAR  employee or for the production of documents shall be served in  accordance with the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, or applicable state  procedures, as appropriate. If the demand is served by the U.S. mails,  it should be   addressed to the General Counsel, Special Inspector General for  Afghanistan Reconstruction, 2530 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202- 3940. If the demand is served by overnight delivery service or courier,  it should be directed to the General Counsel, Special Inspector General  for Afghanistan Reconstruction, 2530 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202- 3940. SIGAR's acceptance of a demand shall not constitute an admission  or waiver of any objection with respect to the propriety of  jurisdiction, service of process, venue, or any other defense in law or  equity available under applicable law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A subpoena or other demand for testimony directed to an employee  or former employee shall be served in accordance with the Federal Rules  of Civil or Criminal Procedure or applicable State procedure; and a copy  of the subpoena or demand shall be delivered to the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Touhy Request. In court cases in which the United States or  SIGAR is not a party, where the giving of testimony or the production of  documents by SIGAR, or a current or former employee is desired, a  verified statement (declaration under penalty of perjury) by the  litigant or his counsel, setting forth the information with respect to  which the testimony or production is desired (``Touhy Request''), must  be submitted in order to obtain a decision concerning whether such  testimony or production will be authorized by SIGAR. The Touhy Request  should include: the title of the legal proceeding, the court or other  forum, the requesting party's interest in the legal proceeding, a  statement whether other evidence reasonably suited to the requester's  needs is not otherwise available, and, if testimony is requested, the  subject matter and intended use of the testimony, a statement whether  document(s) could be provided in lieu of testimony to satisfy the  request, and a statement that the requester will submit a check for  costs of duplication at commercially reasonable rates to SIGAR if the  request is granted. The purpose of these requirements is to assist the  General Counsel in making a fair and informed decision under governing  law regarding whether testimony or the production of document should be  authorized and under what conditions, if any. Permission to testify or  produce documents will be limited to the areas of proposed testimony  described in the Touhy Request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Agency counsel may consult or negotiate with an attorney for a  party or the party, if not represented by an attorney, to refine or  limit a demand so that compliance is less burdensome or to obtain  information necessary to make the determination required by paragraph  (e) of this section. Failure of the requester to cooperate in good faith  to enable the General Counsel to make an informed determination under  this subpart may serve as a basis for denying the Touhy Request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A determination under this section to comply or not to comply  with the Touhy Request is without prejudice to the agency's assertion of  privilege, lack of relevance, technical deficiency, or any other  objection to the demand.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Employees shall immediately refer all inquiries and demands  made to SIGAR or its employees to the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An employee who receives a demand shall forward the demand to  the General Counsel, who will determine the agency's response to the  demand under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Factors to be considered by the General Counsel with respect to  a Touhy Request. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In deciding whether to authorize the release of  official information or the testimony of SIGAR personnel concerning  official information (hereafter referred to as the ``disclosure''), the  General Counsel shall consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the demand is unduly burdensome to the agency or  otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery,  evidence and procedure governing the litigation in which the demand  arose, balanced against the need for the specific testimony or documents  sought;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the demand is appropriate under the relevant  substantive law of privilege and disclosure of Government information,  or seeks information or documents protected from disclosure under the  Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b), the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.  552a, or the Inspector   General Act of 1978, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the demand would interfere with SIGAR's statutory  mandate stated in the ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2008,'' Pub. L. 110-181 (Jan. 28, 2008), Section 1229 (122 Stat.  378-85), as amended; Pub. L. 110-181, Section 842 (122 Stat. 234-36), 10  U.S.C. 2302 note; or the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, 5  U.S.C. App.;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the demand would be in the public interest;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The extent to which the time of employees for conducting  official agency business would be compromised;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Whether the request demonstrates that the information requested  is relevant and material to the action pending, genuinely necessary to  the proceeding, unavailable from other sources, and reasonable in scope;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Whether other similar requests are likely to have a  deleterious cumulative effect on the expenditure of agency time and  resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Among those demands and requests in response to which compliance  will ordinarily not be authorized are those with respect to which any of  the following factors exists:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The requested disclosure elicits information or documents  protected by a statute, Executive Order or regulation, including but not  limited to Section 7(b) of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as  amended, 5 U.S.C. App. 3, section 7(b), or other prohibition from  disclosure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The requested disclosure would interfere with ongoing  enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal the  identity of an intelligence source, confidential informant or undercover  agent, or disclose trade secrets or similar confidential commercial or  financial information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The integrity of the administrative and deliberative processes  of SIGAR would be jeopardized;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The requested disclosure would not be appropriate under the  rules of procedure governing the pending litigation or matter in which  the demand arose;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The requested disclosure is not appropriate under the relevant  substantive law concerning privilege; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The requested disclosure, except when production is in camera,  would reveal information properly classified or other matters exempt  from unrestricted disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All decisions granting or denying a Touhy Request must be in  writing and, if a denial, provide the grounds for the decision in  summary form based on one or more of the factors listed above.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requests for opinion or expert testimony. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pursuant to 5 CFR  2635.805, an employee shall not provide, with or without compensation,  opinion or expert testimony in any proceeding before a court or agency  of the United States in which the United States is a party or has a  direct and substantial interest, except on behalf of the United States  or a party represented by the Department of Justice, without written  approval of agency counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon a showing by the requestor of exceptional need or unique  circumstances, the General Counsel may, in writing, grant authorization  for an employee, or former employee, to appear and testify.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any expert or opinion testimony by a former employee of SIGAR  shall be excepted from the restriction under 5 CFR 2635.805 where the  testimony involves only general expertise gained while employed at  SIGAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Procedures when agency counsel directs an employee not to  testify or provide documents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If agency counsel determines that an  employee or former employee should not comply with a subpoena or other  request for testimony or the production of documents, agency counsel  will so inform the employee and the requesting party who submitted the  demand.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If, despite the determination of the agency counsel that  testimony should not be given or documents not be produced, a court of  competent jurisdiction or other tribunal orders the employee or former  employee to testify and/or produce documents, the employee shall  promptly notify the General Counsel of such Order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If agency counsel determines that no further legal review of,  appeal from, or challenge to, the Order will be   sought, agency counsel shall promptly inform the employee or former  employee of said determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If SIGAR determines to challenge an Order directing testimony  or the production of documents in litigation in which the United States  is not a party, the employee should not comply with the Order. The  employee should appear at the time and place as commanded in the order  or subpoena. If legal counsel cannot appear on behalf of the employee,  the employee should produce a copy of this section and respectfully  inform the Court or other legal tribunal that he/she has been advised by  the General Counsel not to provide the requested testimony or documents  pursuant to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in United  States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951), and this section.  Agency counsel will coordinate with the DOJ to file such motions or  other pleadings that may be deemed appropriate in the circumstances,  such as, for example, a notice to remove the case from state court to  Federal court, or a motion to quash or modify the subpoena, or a motion  for a protective order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fees. In the event that a Touhy Request is granted, SIGAR may  charge reasonable fees to parties seeking official information or  records. Such fees are calculated to reimburse the Government for the  expense of providing such information or records, and may include the  costs of time expended by SIGAR employees to process and respond to the  request; attorney time for reviewing the request and any responsive  records and for related legal work in connection with the request; and  reasonable expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search  for, produce, and copy the responsive information or records.</p>
