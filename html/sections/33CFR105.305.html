                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Background. The facility owner or operator must ensure that the following background information, if applicable, is provided to the person or persons who will conduct the assessment:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The general layout of the facility, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The location of each active and inactive access point to the facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The number, reliability, and security duties of facility personnel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Security doors, barriers, and lighting;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The location of restricted areas;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The emergency and stand-by equipment available to maintain essential services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The maintenance equipment, cargo spaces, storage areas, and unaccompanied baggage storage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Location of escape and evacuation routes and assembly stations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Existing security and safety equipment for protection of personnel and visitors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Response procedures for fire or other emergency conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procedures for monitoring facility and vessel personnel, vendors, repair technicians, and dock workers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Existing contracts with private security companies and existing agreements with local or municipal agencies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Procedures for controlling keys and other access prevention systems;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Procedures for cargo and vessel stores operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Response capability to security incidents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Threat assessments, including the purpose and methodology of the assessment, for the port in which the facility is located or at which passengers embark or disembark;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Previous reports on security needs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Any other existing security procedures and systems, equipment, communications, and facility personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> On-scene survey. The facility owner or operator must ensure that an on-scene survey of each facility is conducted. The on-scene survey examines and evaluates existing facility protective measures, procedures, and operations to verify or collect the information required in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Analysis and recommendations. In conducting the FSA, the facility owner or operator must ensure that the FSO analyzes the facility background information and the on-scene survey, and considering the requirements of this part, provides recommendations to establish and prioritize the security measures that should be included in the FSP. The analysis must consider:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each vulnerability found during the on-scene survey including but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Waterside and shore-side access to the facility and vessel berthing at the facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Structural integrity of the piers, facilities, and associated structures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Existing security measures and procedures, including identification systems;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Existing security measures and procedures relating to services and utilities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Measures to protect radio and telecommunication equipment, including computer systems and networks;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Adjacent areas that may be exploited during or for an attack;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Areas that may, if damaged or used for illicit observation, pose a risk to people, property, or operations within the facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Existing agreements with private security companies providing waterside and shore-side security services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Any conflicting policies between safety and security measures and procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Any conflicting facility operations and security duty assignments;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Any enforcement and personnel constraints;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Any deficiencies identified during daily operations or training and drills; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Any deficiencies identified following security incidents or alerts, the report of security concerns, the exercise of control measures, or audits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Possible security threats, including but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Damage to or destruction of the facility or of a vessel moored at the facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Hijacking or seizure of a vessel moored at the facility or of persons on board;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tampering with cargo, essential equipment or systems, or stores of a vessel moored at the facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Unauthorized access or use including the presence of stowaways;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Smuggling dangerous substances and devices to the facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Use of a vessel moored at the facility to carry those intending to cause a security incident and their equipment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Use of a vessel moored at the facility as a weapon or as a means to cause damage or destruction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Impact on the facility and its operations due to a blockage of entrances, locks, and approaches; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Use of the facility as a transfer point for nuclear, biological, radiological, explosive, or chemical weapons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Threat assessments by Government agencies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Vulnerabilities, including human factors, in the facility's infrastructure, policies and procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any particular aspects of the facility, including the vessels using the facility, which make it likely to be the target of an attack;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Likely consequences in terms of loss of life, damage to property, and economic disruption, including disruption to transportation systems, of an attack on or at the facility; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Locations where access restrictions or prohibitions will be applied for each MARSEC Level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> FSA report.
