                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. The Counsel may condition the production of records  or appearance for testimony upon advance payment of a reasonable  estimate of the costs to OIG.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fees for records. Fees for producing records will include fees  for searching, reviewing, and duplicating records, costs of attorney  time spent in reviewing the demand or request, and expenses generated by  materials and equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the  responsive information. Costs for employee time will be calculated on  the basis of the hourly pay of the employee (including all pay,  allowance, and benefits). Fees for duplication will be the same as those  charged by OIG in its Freedom of Information Act Regulations at 24 CFR  part 2002.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Witness fees. Fees for attendance by a witness will include  fees, expenses, and allowances prescribed by the court's rules. If no  such fees are prescribed, witness fees will be determined based upon the  rule of the federal district court closest to the location where the  witness will appear. Such fees will include cost of time spent by the  witness to prepare for testimony, in travel, and for attendance in the  legal proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment of fees. You must pay any applicable witness fees for  current OIG employees and any records certification fees by submitting  to the Counsel a check or money order for the appropriate amount made  payable to the Treasury of the United States. In the case of testimony  by former OIG employees, you must pay applicable fees directly to the  former employee in accordance with applicable statutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Waiver or reduction of fees. The Counsel, in his or her sole  discretion, may, upon a showing of reasonable cause, waive or reduce any  fees in connection with the testimony or production of records.  Additionally, fees will not be assessed if the total charge would be  $10.00 or less.</p><p class="depth2">PARTS 2005	2099 [RESERVED]</p>
