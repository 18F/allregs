                            <p class="depth0">The Information and Privacy Coordinator is responsible for acting on all initial requests except for requests for records coming under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the Bureau of Human Resources, the Office of Medical Services, and the Office of the Inspector General.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Third party requests. Except for requests under the Privacy Act by a parent of a minor or by a legal guardian (Sec. 171.32(c)), requests for records pertaining to another individual shall be processed under the FOIA and must be accompanied by a written authorization for access by the individual, notarized or made under penalty of perjury, or by proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., death certificate or obituary).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Expedited processing. Requests and appeals shall be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever a requester has demonstrated that a ``compelling need'' for the information exists. A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at any later time. The request for expedited processing shall set forth with specificity the facts on which the request is based. A notice of the determination whether to grant expedited processing shall be provided to the requester within 10 days of the date of the receipt of the request. A ``compelling need'' is deemed to exist where the requester can demonstrate one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Failure to obtain requested information on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to: Pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; impair substantial due process rights; or harm substantial humanitarian interests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information is urgently needed by an individual primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity. News media requesters would normally qualify; however, other persons must demonstrate that their primary activity involves publishing or otherwise disseminating information to the public, not just a particular segment or group.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Urgently needed. The information has a particular value that will be lost if not disseminated quickly. Ordinarily this means a breaking news story of general public interest. Information of historical interest only, or information sought for litigation or commercial activities would not qualify, nor would a news media publication or broadcast deadline unrelated to the breaking nature of the story.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Actual or alleged Federal Government activity. The information concerns some actions taken, contemplated, or alleged by or about the government of the United States, or one of its components or agencies, including the Congress.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeal of denial of expedited processing. Any denial of a request for expedited processing may be appealed in accordance with the appeal procedure set forth in Sec. 171.50.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time limits. The statutory time limit for responding to a FOIA request or to an appeal from a denial of a FOIA request is 20 days. In unusual circumstances, as defined in Sec. 171.11(k), the time limits may be extended by the Information and Privacy Coordinator for not more than 10 days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays, or legal public holidays.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Multitrack processing. The Department may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request. The Department may provide requesters in a slower track an opportunity to limit the scope of their request in order to qualify for faster processing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Form or format of response. The Department shall provide requested records in any form or format sought by the requester if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format through reasonable efforts.</p>
