Information routinely made available to the public as part of a regular Foundation activity (for example, program announcements and solicitations, summary of awarded proposals, statistical reports on U.S. science, press releases issued by the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs) may be provided to the public without reliance on this part. As a matter of policy, the Foundation also makes discretionary disclosures of

records or information otherwise exempt under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. This policy, however, does not create any right enforceable in court. When individuals seek records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, NSF processes those requests under both NSF's Privacy regulations at part 613 of this chapter, and this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As used in this part, NSF includes one component, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the National Science Foundation.</p>
