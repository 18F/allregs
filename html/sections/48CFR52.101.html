                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. Modification, as used in this subpart, means a minor  change in the details of a provision or clause that is specifically  authorized by the FAR and does not alter the substance of the provision  or clause (see 52.104).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Numbering--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FAR provisions and clauses. Subpart 52.2 sets  forth the texts of all FAR provisions and clauses, each in its own  separate subsection. The subpart is arranged by subject matter, in the  same order as, and keyed to, the parts of the FAR. Each FAR provision or  clause is uniquely identified. All FAR provision and clause numbers  begin with ``52.2,'' since the text of all FAR provisions and clauses  appear in subpart 52.2. The next two digits of the provision or clause  number correspond to the number of the FAR subject part in which the  provision or clause is prescribed. The FAR provision or clause number is  then completed by a hyphen and a sequential number assigned within each  section of subpart 52.2. The following example illustrates the makeup of  the FAR provision or clause number:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY91.000</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provisions or  clauses that supplement the FAR are--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Prescribed and included in authorized agency acquisition  regulations issued within an agency to satisfy the specific needs of the  agency as a whole;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Prescribed and included in a regulation issued by a  suborganization of an agency to satisfy the needs of that particular  suborganization; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Developed for use at a suborganizational level of an agency, not  meant for repetitive use, but intended to meet the needs of an  individual acquisition and, thus, impractical to include in either an  agency or suborganization acquisition regulation. (See 1.301(c).)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Supplemental provisions or clauses published in agency  acquisition regulations shall be in full text and the prescription for  the use of each shall be included. Supplemental provisions or clauses  published in agency acquisition regulations shall be numbered in the  same manner in which FAR provisions and clauses are numbered except  that--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If it is included in an agency acquisition regulation that is  published in the Federal Register and is codified in Title 48, Code of  Federal Regulations (48 CFR), the number shall be preceded by the  chapter number within 48 CFR assigned by the CFR staff; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The sequential number shall be ``70'' or a higher number (see  1.303).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The sequential number at the end of the number of a provision  or clause that supplements the FAR, like its counterpart at the end of  any FAR provision or clause number, indicates the subsection location of  the provision or clause in subpart 52.2 of the agency acquisition  regulation that contains its full text. If, for example, an agency  acquisition regulation contains only one provision followed by only one  clause supplementing the FAR in its section 52.236 (Construction and  Architect-Engineer Contracts), then the sequential numbers would be  ``70'' for the provision and ``71'' for the clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prescriptions. Each provision or clause in subpart 52.2 is  prescribed at that place in the FAR text where the subject matter of the  provision or clause receives its primary treatment. The prescription  includes all conditions, requirements, and instructions for using the  provision or clause and its alternates, if any. The provision or clause  may be referred to in other FAR locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Introductory text. Within subpart 52.2, the introductory text of  each provision or clause includes a cross-reference to the location in  the FAR subject text that prescribes its use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Matrix. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The matrix in subpart 52.3 contains a column for  each principal type and/or purpose of contract (e.g., fixed-price  supply, cost reimbursement research and development).

The  resulting consolidated matrices may be included in agency acquisition  regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Dates. Since they are subject to revision from time to time, all  provisions, clauses, and alternates are dated; e.g., (DEC 1983). To  avoid questions concerning which version of any provision, clause, or  alternate is operative in any given solicitation or contract, its date  shall be included whether it is incorporated by reference or in full  text.
