[78 FR 37958, June 25, 2013]    Sec. Appendix A to Part 741--Examples of Partial-Year NCUSIF Assessment</p><p class="depth0">and Distribution Calculations Under Sec. 741.4</p><p class="depth0">The following examples illustrate the calculation of deposit and  premium assessments under each circumstance addressed in paragraphs (i)  and (j) of Sec. 741.4.</p><p class="depth0">A. Direct Conversion to NCUSIF Insurance</p><p class="depth0">1. Paragraph (i)(1)(i) provides that a credit union or other  institution that converts to insurance coverage with the NCUSIF will  immediately fund its one percent deposit based on the total of its  insured shares as of the last day of the most recently ended reporting  period prior to the date of conversion.</p><p class="depth0">i. The following hypothetical illustrates the application of this  provision. Assume Main Street Credit Union completes its conversion from  nonfederal to federal insurance on May 15 of Year One. Assume further  that Main Street credit union had 1,000 insured shares for the end of  month in December of the previous year (Year zero), 1,100 insured shares  for at the end of May, the month of conversion, and 1,200 insured shares  at the end of June. This information is presented in this Table A:\1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Although Main Street Credit Union was not federally insured as  of December 31 of Year Zero, proposed Sec. 741.4(b)(3) provides that  ``For a credit union or other entity that is not federally insured,  `insured shares' means, for purposes of this section only, the amount of  deposits or shares that would have been insured by the NCUSIF under part  745 had the institution been federally insured on the date of  measurement.''</p><p class="depth0">Table A ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">End of month,</p><p class="depth0">End of month,    May, year one</p><p class="depth0">December, year       (month       End of month,</p><p class="depth0">zero          conversion     June, year one</p><p class="depth0">completed) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Main Street Credit Union's Federally Insured Shares..........           1,000            1,100            1,200 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">ii. Paragraph (i)(1)(i) requires that on the date of its conversion,  Main Street fund its one percent deposit based on ``the total of its  insured shares as of the last day of the most recently ended reporting  period prior to the date of conversion.'' Since Main Street has less  than $50,000,000 in assets, its reporting period is annual, and ends on  December 31. 12 CFR 741.4(b)(6) (definition of ``reporting period'').  Main Street had $1,000 in insured shares on that date, and one percent  of that is $10, and so that is the amount Main Street must immediately  remit to the NCUSIF to establish its one percent deposit.</p><p class="depth0">2. Paragraph (i)(1)(ii) provides that a credit union or other  institution that converts to insurance coverage with the NCUSIF will, if  the NCUSIF assesses a premium in the calendar year of conversion, pay a  premium based on the institution's insured shares as of the last day of  the most recently ended reporting period preceding the invoice date  times the institution's premium/distribution ratio * * *.</p><p class="depth0">i. To illustrate the application of paragraph (i)(1)(ii), take the  same facts in hypothetical A related to the conversion of Main Street  from nonfederal to federal insurance. Now, further assume that on the  previous March 15, NCUA had declared a premium assessment, and on  September 15 following the conversion NCUA sent out the invoices for the  March 15 assessment. Also assume that Main Street had grown to 1,300  insured shares at the end of September, the month the invoices were sent  to Main Street and other credit unions. This information is presented in  this Table B:</p><p class="depth0">Table B ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">End of month,</p><p class="depth0">End of month,    May, year one                     End of month,</p><p class="depth0">December, year       (month       End of month,   September, year</p><p class="depth0">zero          conversion     June, year one     one (month</p><p class="depth0">completed)                      invoice sent) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Main Street Credit Union's Federally Insured           1,000            1,100            1,200            1,300</p><p class="depth0">Shares..................................... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">ii. Paragraph (i)(1)(ii) requires Main Street pay a premium based on  the institution's ``insured shares as of the last day of the most  recently ended reporting period preceding the invoice date times the  institution's premium/distribution ratio.'' Again, because Main Street  is under $50 million in assets, the most recently ended reporting period  preceding the September 15 invoice date is all the way back to December  of Year Zero, when Main Street had $1,000 in shares. Main Street's  ``premium/distribution ratio,'' as defined in Sec. 741.4(b)(5), is ``the  number of full remaining months in the calendar year following the date  of the institution's conversion or merger divided by 12.'' Since Main  Street completed its conversion in May, there are seven full months  remaining in the calendar year (June through December), and Main  Street's premium/distribution ratio is seven divided by 12. Accordingly,  Main Street's premium will be assessed on $1,000 times seven divided by  12, or about $583.\2\ Note that if Main Street's assets had exceeded $50  million as of June 30, it would have had semiannual reporting periods  under Sec. 741.4(b)(6), and its ``insured shares as of the last day of  the most recently ended reporting period preceding the invoice date''  would have been its insured shares as of June 30, Year One, and not as  of December 31, Year Zero. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Main Street's actual premium charge will be this $583 divided by  the aggregate insured shares of all federally insured credit unions  times the aggregate premium for all federally insured credit unions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3. Paragraphs (i)(1)(iii) and (iv) describe the responsibility of a  credit union or other entity converting to federal insurance to  replenish a depleted NCUSIF deposit, as follows: A credit union or other  institution that converts to insurance coverage with the NCUSIF will, if  the NCUSIF declares, in the calendar year of conversion but on or before  the date of conversion, an assessment to replenish the one-percent  deposit, pay nothing related to that assessment; if the NCUSIF declares,  at any time after the date of conversion through the end of that  calendar year, an assessment to replenish the one-percent deposit, pay a  replenishment amount based on the institution's insured shares as of the  last day of the most recently ended reporting period preceding the  invoice date.</p><p class="depth0">i. Paragraph (i)(1)(iii) clarifies that a converting credit union  has no responsibility to pay anything toward the replenishment of a  depleted deposit that is declared on or before the date of conversion,  even if NCUA sends out invoices related to the depletion after the date  of conversion. Paragraph (i)(1)(iv) requires that a converting credit  union replenish its deposit with regard to a depletion declared after  the date of conversion through the end of the calendar year. Again,  assume the same facts for Main Street as in Table B,   but that the deposit depletion was announced in June, after Main Street  converted, and that NCUA sent the invoices in September.</p><p class="depth0">Table B ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">End of month,</p><p class="depth0">End of month,    May, year one                     End of month,</p><p class="depth0">December, year       (month       End of month,   September, year</p><p class="depth0">zero          conversion     June, year one     one (month</p><p class="depth0">completed)                      invoice sent) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Main Street Credit Union's Federally Insured           1,000            1,100            1,200            1,300</p><p class="depth0">Shares..................................... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">ii. Main Street would receive an invoice amount ``based on the [Main  Street's] insured shares as of the last day of the most recently ended  reporting period preceding the invoice date.'' Since Main Street has  less than $50 million in shares, the most recently ended reporting  period preceding the September invoice date was December 31, Year Zero,  and it would pay for the replenishment based on $1,000 in insured  shares. If Main Street, however, had had $50 million or more in assets  on June 30, its most recently ended reporting period preceding the  invoice date would have been the semiannual period ending on June 30,  and Main Street would have used its insured shares as of June 30 to  calculate the replenishment amount due to the NCUSIF.</p><p class="depth0">4. Under the Federal Credit Union Act, distributions, if any, are  declared once a year, early in the year, based on excess funds in the  NCUSIF as of the prior December 31. Paragraph (i)(1)(v) describes the  right of a credit union or other entity converting to federal insurance  to receive a distribution from the NCUSIF, specifically: A credit union  or other institution that converts to insurance coverage with the NCUSIF  will, if the NCUSIF declares a distribution in the year following  conversion based the NCUSIF's equity at the end of the year of  conversion, receive a distribution based on the institution's insured  shares as of the end of the year of conversion times the institution's  premium/distribution ratio. With regard to distributions declared in the  calendar year of conversion but based on the NCUSIF's equity at the end  of the preceding year, the converting institution will receive no  distribution.</p><p class="depth0">i. To illustrate how paragraph (i)(1)(v) works, assume that Main  Street Credit Union converts to federal insurance in May of Year One,  and that the NCUA declares a distribution in January of Year Two based  on the NCUSIF equity as of December 31 of Year One. Then Main Street  will be entitled to a pro rata portion of the distribution, calculated  on its insured shares as of December 31 of Year One times its premium/ distribution ratio. Since it converted in May of Year One, and there  were seven full months remaining in Year One at on the date of  conversion, Main Street's premium/distribution ratio under  Sec. 741.4(b)(6) equals seven divided by 12.</p><p class="depth0">ii. On the other hand, if the NCUA declared a distribution a year  earlier, that is, in January of Year One based on the NCUSIF's equity  ratio as of December 31 in Year Zero, then under paragraph (i)(1)(v)  Main Street would receive no part of this distribution. Main Street is  not entitled to any part of this distribution because Main Street, which  completed its conversion in Year One, did not contribute in any way to  the excess funds in the NCUSIF as of the end of Year Zero.</p><p class="depth0">B. Conversion to NCUSIF Coverage Through Merger with a Federally  Insured Credit Union.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (i)(2) addresses the NCUSIF premiums, deposit  replenishments, and distribution calculations when a nonfederally  insured credit union or entity converts to NCUSIF coverage by merging  with a federally insured credit union.</p><p class="depth0">1. Paragraph (i)(2)(i) provides that a federally-insured credit  union that merges with a nonfederally-insured credit union or other non- federally insured institution (the ``merging institution''), where the  federally-insured credit union is the continuing institution, will  immediately on the date of merger increase the amount of its NCUSIF  deposit by an amount equal to one percent of the merging institution's  insured shares as of the last day of the merging institution's most  recently ended reporting period preceding the date of merger.</p><p class="depth0">i. To illustrate this provision, and the other provisions of  paragraph (i)(2) related to mergers of nonfederally insured entities  into federally-insured credit unions, consider the following  hypothetical. Nonfederally-insured Credit Union A merges into federally- insured Credit Union B on August 15 of Year One. The relevant insured  shares of Credit Union A and Credit Union B at various dates before and  after the merger are reflected in Table D:</p><p class="depth0">Table D ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">End of month    End of Month</p><p class="depth0">End of month                    August, year     September,</p><p class="depth0">December, year   End of month     one (month       year one</p><p class="depth0">zero       June, year one      merger      (month invoice</p><p class="depth0">completed)         sent) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Credit Union A Insured shares...................           1,000           1,100             N/A             N/A Credit Union B Insured shares...................           9,000           9,900          12,900          14,000 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">ii. Paragraph (i)(2)(i) requires that Credit Union B, the continuing  credit union, immediately increase the amount of its deposit with the  NCUSIF in an amount ``equal to one percent of the merging institution's  insured shares as of the last day of the merging institution's most  recently ended reporting period preceding the date of merger.'' Since  Credit Union A, the merging institution, has less than $50 million in  assets, its reporting period is the calendar year, and its most recently  ended reporting period preceding the August merger date is December 31  in Year Zero. Credit Union A had $1,000 in insured shares on that date.  Accordingly, Credit Union B, the continuing credit union, must  immediately increase the amount of its deposit with the NCUSIF by one  percent of $1,000, or $10. Note that if Credit Union A had been a larger  credit union, with $50 million or more in assets on June 30 in Year One,  then Credit Union B would have used Credit Union A's insured shares as  of June 30 in this calculation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Paragraph (i)(2)(ii), relating to NCUSIF premium assessments,  provides that the continuing institution will, with regard to any NCUSIF  premiums assessed in the calendar year of merger, pay a two-part  premium, with one part calculated on the merging institution's insured  shares as described in subparagraph (1)(ii) above, and the other part  calculated on the continuing institution's insured shares as of the last  day of its most recently ended reporting period preceding the date of  merger.</p><p class="depth0">i. Paragraph (i)(2)(ii) provides for a two-part calculation, with  the first part relating to the merging credit union and the second part  relating to the continuing credit union. Assuming the facts as in Table  D, and assuming the premium is assessed sometime in Year One, calculate  the insured shares of Credit Union A, the merging credit union, as in  the example for paragraph (i)(1)(ii). Once again, because Credit Union A  is under $50 million in assets, the most recently ended reporting period  preceding the invoice date is December of Year Zero, when Credit Union A  had $1,000 in shares. The merger was completed in August, leaving four  full months in the calendar year, so the premium/distribution ratio is  four divided by 12. Accordingly, this part of the premium will be  assessed on $1,000 times four divided by 12, or about $333. Then  calculate the insured shares of Credit Union B, the continuing credit  union, ``as of the last day of its most recently ended reporting period  preceding the merger date.'' Since Credit Union B is also under $50  million in assets, ``the last day of the most recently ended reporting  period'' is also December 31 of Year Zero. Credit Union B's insured  shares on that date were $9,000, and so the combined insured shares for  purposes of the premium assessment is $9,333. Note that if Credit Union  B had $50 million or more in assets on June 30 of Year One, then Credit  Union B's ``most recently ended reporting period preceding the merger  date'' would have been June 30 of Year One, and not December 31 of Year  Zero. The Board is aware that the NCUA might declare a NCUSIF premium,  invoice it, and receive the premiums in Year One from the continuing  institution before the continuing institution consummates its merger. In  that case, the Board would invoice the continuing credit union again  after the merger, but only for the difference between the amount  previously invoiced and the amount calculated under paragraph  (i)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">3. Paragraph (i)(2)(iii) prescribes the procedures for calculating  the NCUSIF distribution when a nonfederally insured credit union or  entity merges into a federally insured credit union. Paragraph  (i)(2)(iii) provides that the federally insured credit union will, if  the NCUSIF declares a distribution in the year following the merger  based on the NCUSIF's equity at the end of the year of merger, receive a  distribution based on the continuing institution's insured shares as of  the end of the year of merger. With regard to distributions declared in  the calendar year of merger but based on the NCUSIF's equity from the  end of the preceding year, the institution will receive a distribution  based on its insured shares as of the end of the preceding year.</p><p class="depth0">i. This formula recognizes that the merging institution did not  contribute to the NCUSIF equity as of the end of the year preceding the  merger and so no distribution is allotted against the merging  institution's shares. As for distributions based on the NCUSIF equity at  the end of the year of merger, this formula does not include any pro  rata reduction for the merging institution's contribution. The Board  determined   that a pro rata reduction was unnecessary, given the generally small  relative size of merging institutions to continuing institutions, and  the fact that the Federal Credit Union Act does not require any sort of  pro rata reduction or other pro rata calculation with regard to  distributions.</p><p class="depth0">C. Conversion from, or termination of, Federal share insurance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (j)(1) addresses direct insurance conversions and  conversions by merger. Paragraph (j)(2) addresses liquidations and  insurance termination.</p><p class="depth0">1. Paragraph (j)(1)(i) provides that a federally insured credit  union whose insurance coverage with the NCUSIF terminates, including  through a conversion to, or merger into, a nonfederally insured credit  union or a noncredit union entity, will receive the full amount of its  NCUSIF deposit paid, less any amounts applied to cover NCUSIF losses  that exceed NCUSIF retained earnings, immediately after the final date  on which any shares of the credit union are NCUSIF-insured.</p><p class="depth0">i. To illustrate the application of this paragraph (j)(1)(i),  consider the following hypothetical. Assume Anytown Credit Union, a  credit union with $30 million in assets, converts from federal to  nonfederal insurance on November 15. Also assume Anytown Credit Union  had $20 million in insured shares as of the previous December 31, the  end of its most recent reporting period. 12 CFR 741.4(b)(5), (c). The  NCUSIF would return one-percent of $20 million, or $200,000 to Anytown  Credit Union immediately following the effective date of its conversion.  Note that, if Anytown Credit Union had reported $50 million or more in  assets on June 30, then June 30 would have been the end of its most  recent reporting period. Now further assume that, on July 15 of that  same year, the NCUSIF had announced an expense that reduced the equity  ratio from 1.3 to .75, which would have included a write-off (depletion)  of 25%, or 25 basis points, of the one-percent deposit. The amount of  the deposit returned to Anytown would be reduced by 25%, from $200,000  to $150,000. If the NCUSIF had announced expenses reducing the equity  ratio to .75 after the November 15 conversion date, this announcement  would have no effect on Anytown and it would still receive the full  $200,000 from the NCUSIF.</p><p class="depth0">2. Paragraph (j)(1)(ii) provides that a federally insured credit  union whose insurance coverage with the NCUSIF terminates, including  through a conversion to, or merger into, a nonfederally insured credit  union or a noncredit union entity, will, if the NCUSIF declares a  distribution at the end of the calendar year of conversion, receive a  distribution based on the institution's insured shares as of the last  day of the most recently ended reporting period preceding the date of  conversion times the institution's modified premium/distribution ratio.</p><p class="depth0">i. To illustrate the application of this paragraph (j)(1)(ii), again  assume Anytown Credit Union converts to nonfederal insurance on November  15, and in January of the following year, the NCUSIF declares a  distribution based on the NCUSIF's equity ratio as of December 31.  Anytown would receive a pro rata distribution calculated as its $20  million in insured shares multiplied by the modified premium/ distribution ratio. Anytown's modified premium/distribution ratio, from  the definition in Sec. 741.4(b)(5), is one minus Anytown's premium/ distribution ratio, which is one minus the ratio of the full number of  months remaining in the year divided by twelve, which is one minus (one  divided by twelve), which is eleven divided by twelve. So Anytown would  receive a pro rata distribution based on $20 million of insured shares  times eleven-twelfths, or based on about $18.33 million in shares.\3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ Anytown's actual distribution would be $18.33 million times the  aggregate amount of the distribution divided by the aggregate amount of  all insured shares at all federally insured credit unions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3. Paragraph (j)(1)(iii) provides that a federally insured credit  union whose insurance coverage with the NCUSIF terminates, including  through a conversion to, or merger into, a nonfederally insured credit  union or a noncredit union entity, will, if the NCUSIF assesses a  premium in the calendar year of conversion or merger on or before the  day in which the conversion or merger is completed, pay a premium based  on the institution's insured shares as of the last day of the most  recently ended reporting period preceding the conversion or merger date  times the institution's modified premium/distribution ratio. If the  institution has previously paid a premium based on this same assessment  that exceeds this amount, the institution will receive a refund of the  difference following completion of the conversion or merger.</p><p class="depth0">i. To illustrate these premium provisions, again assume Anytown  Credit Union is a credit union with $30 million in assets that converts  from federal to nonfederal insurance on November 15 of Year One, and  that Anytown Credit Union had $20 million in insured shares as of the  previous December 31 (of Year Zero), the end of its most recent  reporting period. Further assume that NCUA declares a premium on  February 12 of Year One and invoices the premium on November 15. Since  the premium was declared ``on or before the day in which [Anytown's]  conversion [was] completed,'' Sec. 741.4(j)(1)(iii) applies. Anytown  would then pay a premium based on $20 million (its ``insured shares as   of the last day of the most recently ended reporting period preceding  the conversion or merger date'') times eleven-twelfths (its ``modified  premium/distribution ratio''), or based on about $18.33 million. Note  that NCUA might have already have invoiced Anytown for the premium  sometime between February 12 and Anytown's merger on November 15. If so,  Anytown will likely receive a refund of some of this earlier premium, as  provided in the last sentence of Sec. 741.1(j)(1)(iii), since it may  have overpaid the earlier premium.

Introduction</p><p class="depth0">This appendix provides guidance to FICUs in developing an interest  rate risk (IRR) policy and program that addresses aspects of asset  liability management in a single framework. An effective IRR management  program identifies, measures, monitors, and controls IRR and is central  to safe and sound credit union operations. Given the differences among  credit unions, each credit union should use the guidance in this  appendix to formulate a policy that embodies its own practices, metrics  and benchmarks appropriate to its operations.</p><p class="depth0">These practices should be established in light of the nature of the  credit union's operations and business, as well as its complexity, risk  exposure, and size. As these elements increase, NCUA believes the IRR  practices should be implemented with increasing degrees of rigor and  diligence to maintain safe and sound operations in the area of IRR  management. In particular, rigor and diligence are required to manage  complexity and risk exposure. Complexity relates to the intricacy of  financial instrument structure, and to the composition of assets and  liabilities on the balance sheet. In the case of financial instruments,  the structure can have numerous characteristics that act simultaneously  to affect the behavior of the instrument. In the case of the balance  sheet, which contains multiple instruments, assets and liabilities can  act in ways that are compounding or can be offsetting because their  impact on the IRR level may act in the same or opposite directions. High  degrees of risk exposure require a credit union to be diligently aware  of the potential earnings and net worth exposures under various interest  rate and business environments because the margin for error is low.</p><p class="depth0">A. Complexity</p><p class="depth0">In influencing the behavior of instruments and balance sheet  composition, complexity is a function of the predictability of the cash  flows. As cash flows become less predictable, the uncertainty of both  instrument and balance sheet behavior increases. For example, a  residential mortgage is subject to prepayments that will change at the  option of the borrower. Mortgage borrowers may pay off their mortgage  loans due to geographical relocation, or may increase the amount of  their monthly payment above the minimum contractual schedule due to  other changes in the borrower's circumstances. This cash flow  unpredictability is also found in investments, such as collateralized  mortgage obligations, because these contain mortgage loans.  Additionally, cash flow unpredictability affects liabilities. For  example, nonmaturity share balances vary at the discretion of the  depositor making deposits and withdrawals, and this may be influenced by  a credit union's pricing of its share accounts.</p><p class="depth0">B. IRR Exposure</p><p class="depth0">Exposure to IRR is the vulnerability of a credit union's financial  condition to adverse movements in market interest rates. Although some  IRR exposure is a normal part of financial intermediation, a high degree  of this exposure may negatively affect a credit union's earnings and net  economic value. Changes in interest rates influence a credit union's  earnings by altering interest-sensitive income and expenses (e.g. loan  income and share dividends). Changes in interest rates also affect the  economic value of a credit union's assets and liabilities, because the  present value of future cash flows and, in some cases, the cash flows  themselves may change when interest rates change. Consequently, the  management of a credit union's pricing strategy is critical to the  control of IRR exposure.</p><p class="depth0">All FICUs required to have an IRR policy and program should  incorporate the following five elements into their IRR program:</p><p class="depth0">1. Board-approved IRR policy.</p><p class="depth0">2. Oversight by the board of directors and implementation by  management.</p><p class="depth0">3. Risk measurement systems assessing the IRR sensitivity of  earnings and/or asset and liability values.</p><p class="depth0">4. Internal controls to monitor adherence to IRR limits.</p><p class="depth0">5. Decision making that is informed and guided by IRR measures.</p><p class="depth0">II. IRR Policy</p><p class="depth0">The board of directors is responsible for ensuring the adequacy of  an IRR policy and its limits. The policy should be consistent with the  credit union's business strategies and should reflect the board's risk  tolerance, taking into account the credit union's financial condition  and risk measurement systems and methods commensurate with the balance  sheet structure. The policy should state actions and authorities  required for exceptions to policy, limits, and authorizations.</p><p class="depth0">Credit unions have the option of either creating a separate IRR  policy or incorporating it into investment, ALM, funds management,  liquidity or other policies. Regardless of form, credit unions must  clearly document their IRR policy in writing.</p><p class="depth0">The scope of the policy will vary depending on the complexity of the  credit union's balance sheet. For example, a credit union that offers  short-term loans, invests in non-complex or short-term bullet  investments (i.e. a debt security that returns 100 percent of principal  on the maturity date), and offers basic share products may not need to  create an elaborate policy. The policy for these credit unions may limit  the loan portfolio maturity, require a minimum amount of short-term  funds, and restrict the types of permissible investments (e.g.  Treasuries, bullet investments). More complex balance sheets, especially  those containing mortgage loans and complex investments, may warrant a  comprehensive IRR policy due to the uncertainty of cash flows.</p><p class="depth0">The policy should establish responsibilities and procedures for  identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting IRR, and  establish risk limits. A written policy should:</p><p class="depth0">Identify committees, persons or other parties responsible  for review of the credit union's IRR exposure;</p><p class="depth0">Direct appropriate actions to ensure management takes steps  to manage IRR so that IRR exposures are identified, measured, monitored,  and controlled;</p><p class="depth0">State the frequency with which management will report on  measurement results to the board to ensure routine review of information  that is timely (e.g. current and at least quarterly) and in sufficient  detail to assess the credit union's IRR profile;</p><p class="depth0">Set risk limits for IRR exposures based on selected  measures (e.g. limits for changes in repricing or duration gaps, income  simulation, asset valuation, or net economic value);</p><p class="depth0">Choose tests, such as interest rate shocks, that the credit  union will perform using the selected measures;</p><p class="depth0">Provide for periodic review of material changes in IRR  exposures and compliance with board approved policy and risk limits;</p><p class="depth0">Provide for assessment of the IRR impact of any new  business activities prior to implementation (e.g. evaluate the IRR  profile of introducing a new product or service); and</p><p class="depth0">Provide for at least an annual evaluation of policy to  determine whether it is still commensurate with the size, complexity,  and risk profile of the credit union.</p><p class="depth0">IRR policy limits should maintain risk exposures within prudent  levels. Examples of limits are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">GAP: less than I 10 percent change in any given period, or  cumulatively over 12 months.</p><p class="depth0">Income Simulation: net interest income after shock change less than  20 percent over any 12-month period.</p><p class="depth0">Asset Valuation: after shock change in book value of net worth less  than 50 percent, or after shock net worth of 4 percent or greater.</p><p class="depth0">Net Economic Value: after shock change in net economic value less  than 25 percent, or after shock net economic value of 6 percent or  greater.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA emphasizes these are only for illustrative purposes, and  management should establish its own limits that are reasonably  supported. Where appropriate, management may also set IRR limits for  individual portfolios, activities, and lines of business.</p><p class="depth0">III. IRR Oversight and Management</p><p class="depth0">A. Board of Directors Oversight</p><p class="depth0">The board of directors is responsible for oversight of their credit  union and for approving policy, major strategies, and prudent limits  regarding IRR. To meet this responsibility, understanding the level and  nature of IRR taken by the credit union is essential. Accordingly, the  board should ensure management executes an effective IRR program.</p><p class="depth0">Additionally, the board should annually assess if the IRR program  sufficiently identifies, measures, monitors, and controls the IRR  exposure of the credit union. Where necessary, the board may consider  obtaining professional advice and training to enhance its understanding  of IRR oversight.</p><p class="depth0">B. Management Responsibilities</p><p class="depth0">Management is responsible for the daily management of activities and  operations. In   order to implement the board's IRR policy, management should:</p><p class="depth0">Develop and maintain adequate IRR measurement systems;</p><p class="depth0">Evaluate and understand IRR risk exposures;</p><p class="depth0">Establish an appropriate system of internal controls (e.g.  separation between the risk taker and IRR measurement staff);</p><p class="depth0">Allocate sufficient resources for an effective IRR program.  For example, a complex credit union with an elevated IRR risk profile  will likely necessitate a greater allocation of resources to identify  and focus on IRR exposures;</p><p class="depth0">Develop and support competent staff with technical  expertise commensurate with the IRR program;</p><p class="depth0">Identify the procedures and assumptions involved in  implementing the IRR measurement systems; and</p><p class="depth0">Establish clear lines of authority and responsibility for  managing IRR; and</p><p class="depth0">Provide a sufficient set of reports to ensure compliance  with board approved policies.</p><p class="depth0">Where delegation of management authority by the board occurs, this  may be to designated committees such as an asset liability committee or  other equivalent. In credit unions with limited staff, these  responsibilities may reside with the board or management. Significant  changes in assumptions, measurement methods, tests performed, or other  aspects involved in the IRR process should be documented and brought to  the attention of those responsible.</p><p class="depth0">IV. IRR Measurement and Monitoring</p><p class="depth0">A. Risk Measurement Systems</p><p class="depth0">Generally, credit unions should have IRR measurement systems that  capture and measure all material and identified sources of IRR. An IRR  measurement system quantifies the risk contained in the credit union's  balance sheet and integrates the important sources of IRR faced by a  credit union in order to facilitate management of its risk exposures.  The selection and assessment of appropriate IRR measurement systems is  the responsibility of credit union boards and management.</p><p class="depth0">Management should:</p><p class="depth0">Rely on assumptions that are reasonable and supportable;</p><p class="depth0">Document any changes to assumptions based on observed  information;</p><p class="depth0">Monitor positions with uncertain maturities, rates and cash  flows, such as nonmaturity shares, fixed rate mortgages where  prepayments may vary, adjustable rate mortgages, and instruments with  embedded options, such as calls; and</p><p class="depth0">Require any interest rate risk calculation techniques,  measures and tests to be sufficiently rigorous to capture risk.</p><p class="depth0">B. Risk Measurement Methods</p><p class="depth0">The following discussion is intended only as a general guide and  should not be used by credit unions as an endorsement of a particular  method. An IRR measurement system may rely on a variety of different  methods. Common examples of methods available to credit unions are GAP  analysis, income simulation, asset valuation, and net economic value.  Any measurement method(s) used by a credit union to analyze IRR exposure  should correspond with the complexity of the credit union's balance  sheet so as to identify any material sources of IRR.</p><p class="depth0">GAP Analysis</p><p class="depth0">GAP analysis is a simple IRR measurement method that reports the  mismatch between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  over a given time period. GAP can only suffice for simple balance sheets  that primarily consist of short-term bullet type investments and non  mortgage-related assets. GAP analysis can be static, behavioral, or  based on duration.</p><p class="depth0">Income Simulation</p><p class="depth0">Income simulation is an IRR measurement method used to estimate  earnings exposure to changes in interest rates. An income simulation  analysis projects interest cash flows of all assets, liabilities, and  off-balance sheet instruments in a credit union's portfolio to estimate  future net interest income over a chosen timeframe. Generally, income  simulations focus on short-term time horizons (e.g. one to three years).  Forecasting income is assumption sensitive and more uncertain the longer  the forecast period. Simulations typically include evaluations under a  base-case scenario, and instantaneous parallel rate shocks, and may  include alternate interest-rate scenarios. The alternate rate scenarios  may involve ramped changes in rates, twisting of the yield curve, and/or  stressed rate environments devised by the user or provided by the  vendor.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA Asset Valuation Tables</p><p class="depth0">For credit unions lacking advanced IRR methods that seek simple  valuation measures, the NCUA Asset Valuation Tables are available and  prepared quarterly by the NCUA. These are available on the NCUA Web site  through www.ncua.gov.</p><p class="depth0">These measures provide an indication of a credit union's potential  interest rate risk, based on the risk associated with the asset  categories of greatest concern--(e.g., mortgage loans and investment  securities).</p><p class="depth0">The tables provide a simple measure of the potential devaluation of  a credit union's mortgage loans and investment securities that occur  during 300 basis point parallel rate shocks, and report the resulting  impact on net worth.</p><p class="depth0">Net Economic Value (NEV)</p><p class="depth0">NEV measures the effect of interest rates on the market value of net  worth by calculating the present value of assets minus the present value  of liabilities. This calculation measures the long-term IRR in a credit  union's balance sheet at a fixed point in time. By capturing the impact  of interest rate changes on the value of all future cash flows, NEV  provides a comprehensive measurement of IRR. Generally, NEV computations  demonstrate the economic value of net worth under current interest rates  and shocked interest rate scenarios.</p><p class="depth0">One NEV method is to discount cash flows by a single interest rate  path. Credit unions with a significant exposure to assets or liabilities  with embedded options should consider alternative measurement methods  such as discounting along a yield curve (e.g. the U.S. Treasury curve,  LIBOR curve) or using multiple interest rate paths. Credit unions should  apply and document appropriate methods, based on available data (e.g.  utilizing observed market values), when valuing individual or groups of  assets and liabilities.</p><p class="depth0">C. Components of IRR Measurement Methods</p><p class="depth0">In the initial setup of IRR measurement, critical decisions are made  regarding numerous variables in the method. These variables include but  are not limited to the following.</p><p class="depth0">Chart of Accounts</p><p class="depth0">Credit unions using an IRR measurement method should define a  sufficient number of accounts to capture key IRR characteristics  inherent within their product lines. For example, credit unions with  significant holdings of adjustable-rate mortgages should differentiate  balances by periodic and lifetime caps and floors, the reset frequency,  and the rate index used for rate resets. Similarly, credit unions with  significant holdings of fixed-rate mortgages should differentiate at  least by original term, e.g., 30 or 15-year, and coupon level to reflect  differences in prepayment behaviors.</p><p class="depth0">Aggregation of Data Input</p><p class="depth0">As the credit union's complexity, risk exposure, and size increases,  the degree of detail should be based on data that is increasingly  disaggregated. Because imprecision in the measurement process can  materially misstate risk levels, management should evaluate the  potential loss of precision from any aggregation and simplification used  in its measurement of IRR.</p><p class="depth0">Account Attributes</p><p class="depth0">Account attributes define a product, including: Principal type, rate  type, rate index, repricing interval, new volume maturity distribution,  accounting accrual basis, prepayment driver, and discount rate.</p><p class="depth0">Assumptions</p><p class="depth0">IRR measurement methods rely on assumptions made by management in  order to identify IRR. The simplest example is of future interest rate  scenarios. The management of IRR will require other assumptions such as:  Projected balance sheet volumes; prepayment rates for loans and  investment securities; repricing sensitivity, and decay rates of  nonmaturity shares. Examples of these assumptions follow.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Credit unions should consider evaluating the balance  sheet under flat (i.e. static) and/or planned growth scenarios to  capture IRR exposures. Under a flat scenario, runoff amounts are  reinvested in their respective asset or liability account. Conducting  planned growth scenarios allows management to assess the IRR impact of  the projected change in volume and/or composition of the balance sheet.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Loans and mortgage related securities contain prepayment  options that enable the borrower to prepay the obligation prior to  maturity. This prepayment option makes it difficult to project the value  and earnings stream from these assets because the future outstanding  principal balance at any given time is unknown. A number of factors  affect prepayments, including the refinancing incentive, seasonality  (the particular time of year), seasoning (the age of the loan), member  mobility, curtailments (additional principal payments), and burnout  (borrowers who don't respond to changes in the level of rates, and pay  as scheduled). Prepayment speeds may be estimated or derived from  numerous national or vendor data sources.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. In the process of IRR measurement, the credit union must  estimate how each account will reprice in response to market rate  fluctuations. For example, when rates rise 300 basis points, the credit  union may raise its asset or liability rates in a like amount or not,  and may choose to lag the timing of its pricing change.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Nonmaturity shares include those accounts with no defined  maturity such as share drafts, regular shares, and money market  accounts. Measuring the IRR associated with these accounts is difficult  because the risk measurement calculations require the user to define the  principal cash flows and maturity. Credit unions may assume that there  is no value when measuring the associated IRR and carry these values at  book value or par. Many credit unions adopt this approach because it  keeps the measurement method simple.</p><p class="depth0">Alternatively, a credit union may attribute value to these shares  (i.e. premium) on the basis that these shares tend to be   lower cost funds that are core balances by virtue of being relatively  insensitive to interest rates. This method generally results in  nonmaturity shares priced/valued in a way that will produce an increased  net economic value. Therefore, the underlying assumptions of the shares  require scrutiny.</p><p class="depth0">Credit unions that forecast share behavior and incorporate those  assumptions into their risk identification and measurement process  should perform sensitivity analysis.</p><p class="depth0">V. Internal Controls</p><p class="depth0">Internal controls are an essential part of a safe and sound IRR  program. If possible, separation of those responsible for the risk  taking and risk measuring functions should occur at the credit union.</p><p class="depth0">Staff responsible for maintaining controls should periodically  assess the overall IRR program as well as compliance with policy.  Internal audit staff would normally assume this role; however, if there  is no internal auditor, management, or a supervisory committee that is  independent of the IRR process, may perform this role. Where  appropriate, management may also supplement the internal audit with  outside expertise to assess the IRR program. This review should include  policy compliance, timeliness, and accuracy of reports given to  management and the board.</p><p class="depth0">Audit findings should be reported to the board or supervisory  committee with recommended corrective actions and timeframes. The  individuals responsible for maintaining internal controls should  periodically examine adherence to the policy related to the IRR program.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Decision-Making Informed by IRR Measurement Systems</p><p class="depth0">Management should utilize the results of the credit union's IRR  measurement systems in making operational decisions such as changing  balance sheet structure, funding, pricing strategies, and business  planning. This is particularly the case when measures show a high level  of IRR or when measurement results approach board-approved limits.</p><p class="depth0">NCUA recognizes each credit union has its own individual risk  profile and tolerance levels. However, when measures of fair value  indicate net worth is low, declining, or even negative, or income  simulations indicate reduced earnings, management should be prepared to  identify steps, if necessary, to bring risk within acceptable levels. In  any case, management should understand and use their IRR measurement  results, whether generated internally or externally, in the normal  course of business. Management should also use the results proactively  as a tool to adjust asset liability management for changes in interest  rate environments.</p><p class="depth0">VII. Guidelines for Adequacy of IRR Policy and Effectiveness of Program</p><p class="depth0">The following guidelines will assist credit unions in determining  the adequacy of their IRR policy and the effectiveness of their program  to manage IRR.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02FE12.012     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02FE12.013</p><p class="depth0">NCUA acknowledges both the range of IRR exposures at credit unions,  and the diverse means that they may use to accomplish an effective  program to manage this risk. NCUA therefore does not stipulate specific  quantitative standards or limits for the management of IRR applicable to  all credit unions, and does not rely solely on the results of  quantitative approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of IRR programs.  Assumptions, measures and methods used by a credit union in light of its  size, complexity and risk exposure determine the specific appropriate  standard. However, NCUA strongly affirms the need for adequate practices  for a program to effectively manage IRR. For example, policy limits on  IRR exposure are not adequate if they allow a credit union to operate  with an exposure that is unsafe or unsound, which means that the credit  union may suffer material losses under plausible adverse circumstances  as a result of this exposure. Credit unions that do not have a written  IRR policy or that do not have an effective IRR program are out of  compliance with Sec. 741.3 of NCUA's regulations.</p><p class="depth0">VIII. Additional Guidance for Large Credit Unions With Complex or High</p><p class="depth0">Risk Balance Sheets</p><p class="depth0">FICUs with assets of $500 million or greater must obtain an annual  audit of their financial statements performed in accordance with  generally accepted accounting standards. 12 CFR 715.5, 715.6, 741.202.  For purposes of data collection, NCUA also uses $500 million and above  as its largest credit union   asset range. In order to gather information and to monitor IRR exposure  at larger credit unions as it relates to the share insurance fund, NCUA  will use this as the criterion for definition of large credit unions for  purposes of this section of the guidance. Given the increased exposure  to the share insurance fund, NCUA encourages the responsible officials  at large credit unions that are complex or high risk to fully understand  all aspects of interest rate risk, including but not limited to the  credit union's IRR assessment and potential directional changes in IRR  exposures. For example, the credit union should consider the following:</p><p class="depth0">A policy which provides for the use of outside parties to  validate the tests and limits commensurate with the risk exposure and  complexity of the credit union;</p><p class="depth0">IRR measurement systems that report compliance with policy  limits as shown both by risks to earnings and net economic value of  equity under a variety of defined and reasonable interest rate  scenarios;</p><p class="depth0">The effect of changes in assumptions on IRR exposure  results (e.g. the impact of slower or faster prepayments on earnings and  economic value); and,</p><p class="depth0">Enhanced levels of separation between risk taking and risk  assessment (e.g. assignment of resources to separate the investments  function from IRR measurement, and IRR monitoring and oversight).</p><p class="depth0">IX. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Basis risk: The risk to earnings and/or value due to a financial  institution's holdings of multiple instruments, based on different  indices that are imperfectly correlated.</p><p class="depth0">Interest rate risk: The risk that changes in market rates will  adversely affect a credit union's net economic value and/or earnings.  Interest rate risk generally arises from a mismatch between the timing  of cash flows from fixed rate instruments, and interest rate resets of  variable rate instruments, on either side of the balance sheet. Thus, as  interest rates change, earnings or net economic value may decline.</p><p class="depth0">Option risk: The risk to earnings and/or value due to the effect on  financial instruments of options associated with these instruments.  Options are embedded when they are contractual within, or directly  associated with, the instrument. An example of a contractual embedded  option is a call option on an agency bond. An example of a behavioral  embedded option is the right of a residential mortgage holder to vary  prepayments on the mortgage through time, either by making additional  premium payments, or by paying off the mortgage prior to maturity.</p><p class="depth0">Repricing risk: The repricing of assets or liabilities following  market changes can occur in different amounts and/or at different times.  This risk can cause returns to vary.</p><p class="depth0">Spread risk: The risk to earnings and/or value resulting from  variations through time of the spread between assets or liabilities to  an underlying index such as the Treasury curve.</p><p class="depth0">Yield curve risk: The risk to earnings and/or value due to changes  in the level or slope of underlying yield curves. Financial instruments  can be sensitive to different points on the curve. This can cause  returns to vary as yield curves change.  [77 FR 5162, Feb. 2, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 57990, Sept. 19, 2012]    Sec. Appendix C to Part 741--Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement on</p><p class="depth0">Loan Workouts, Nonaccrual Policy, and Regulatory Reporting of Troubled</p><p class="depth0">Debt Restructured Loans</p><p class="depth0">This Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement (IRPS) establishes  requirements for the management of loan workout \1\ arrangements, loan  nonaccrual, and regulatory reporting of troubled debt restructured loans  (herein after referred to as TDR or TDRs). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Terms defined in the Glossary will be italicized on their first  use in the body of this guidance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">This IRPS applies to all federally insured credit unions.</p><p class="depth0">Under this IRPS, TDR loans are as defined in generally accepted  accounting principles (GAAP) and the Board does not intend through this  policy to change the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB)  definition of TDR in any way. In addition to existing agency policy,  this IRPS sets NCUA's supervisory expectations governing loan workout  policies and practices and loan accruals.</p><p class="depth0">Written Loan Workout Policy and Monitoring Requirements \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ For additional guidance on member business lending extension,  deferral, renewal, and rewrite policies, see Interagency Policy  Statement on Prudent Commercial Real Estate Loan Workouts (October 30,  2009) transmitted by Letter to Credit Unions No. 10-CU-07, and available  at http://www.ncua.gov. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of this policy statement, types of workout loans to  borrowers in financial difficulties include re-agings, extensions,  deferrals, renewals, or rewrites. See the Glossary entry on ``workouts''  for further descriptions of each term. Borrower retention programs or  new loans are not encompassed within this policy nor considered by the  Board to be workout loans.</p><p class="depth0">Loan workouts can be used to help borrowers overcome temporary  financial difficulties, such as loss of job, medical emergency, or  change in family circumstances like loss of a family member. Loan  workout arrangements should consider and balance the best interests of  both the borrower and the credit union.</p><p class="depth0">The lack of a sound written policy on workouts can mask the true  performance and past due status of the loan portfolio. Accordingly, the  credit union board and management must adopt and adhere to an explicit  written policy and standards that control the use of loan workouts, and  establish controls to ensure the policy is consistently applied. The  loan workout policy and practices should be commensurate with each  credit union's size and complexity, and must be in line with the credit  union's broader risk mitigation strategies. The policy must define  eligibility requirements (i.e., under what conditions the credit union  will consider a loan workout), including establishing limits on the  number of times an individual loan may be modified.\3\ The policy must  also ensure credit unions make loan workout decisions based on the  borrower's renewed willingness and ability to repay the loan. If a  credit union engages in restructuring activity on a loan that results in  restructuring the loan more often than once a year or twice in five  years, examiners will have higher expectations for the documentation of  the borrower's renewed willingness and ability to repay the loan. NCUA  is concerned about restructuring activity that pushes existing losses  into future reporting periods without improving the loan's  collectability. One way a credit union can provide convincing evidence  that multiple restructurings improve collectability is to perform  validation of completed multiple restructurings that substantiate the  claim. Examiners will ask for such validation documentation if the  credit union engages in multiple restructurings of a loan. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ Broad based credit union programs commonly used as a member  benefit and implemented in a safe and sound manner limited to only  accounts in good standing, such as Skip-a-Pay programs, are not intended  to count toward these limits. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">In addition, the policy must establish sound controls to ensure loan  workout actions are appropriately structured.\4\ The policy must provide  that in no event may the credit union authorize additional advances to  finance unpaid interest and credit union fees. The credit union may,  however, make advances to cover third-party fees, excluding credit union  commissions, such as force-placed insurance or property taxes. For loan  workouts granted, the credit union must document the determination that  the borrower is willing and able to repay the loan. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ In developing a written policy, the credit union board and  management may wish to consider similar parameters as those established  in the FFIEC's ``Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account  Management Policy'' (FFIEC Policy). 65 FR 36903 (June 12, 2000). The  FFIEC Policy sets forth specific limitations on the number of times a  loan can be re-aged (for open-end accounts) or extended, deferred,  renewed or rewritten (for closed-end accounts). Additionally, NCUA  Letter to Credit Unions (LCU) 09-CU-19, ``Evaluating Residential Real  Estate Mortgage Loan Modification Programs,'' outlines policy  requirements for real estate modifications. Those requirements remain  applicable to real estate loan modifications but could be adapted in  part by the credit union in their written loan workout policy for other  loans. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Management must ensure that comprehensive and effective risk  management and internal controls are established and maintained so that  loan workouts can be adequately controlled and monitored by the credit  union's board of directors and management, to provide for timely  recognition of losses,\5\ and to permit review by examiners. The credit  union's risk management framework must include thresholds based on  aggregate volume of loan workout activity that trigger enhanced  reporting to the board of directors. This reporting will enable the  credit union's board of directors to evaluate the effectiveness of the  credit union's loan workout program, any implications to the  organization's financial condition, and to make any compensating  adjustments to the overall business strategy. This information will also  then be available to examiners upon request. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ Refer to NCUA guidance on charge-offs set forth in LCU 03-CU-01,  ``Loan Charge-off Guidance,'' dated January 2003. Examiners will require  that a reasonable written charge-off policy is in place and that it is  consistently applied. Additionally, credit unions need to adjust  historical loss factors when calculating ALLL needs for pooled loans to  account for any loans with protracted charge-off timeframes (e.g., 12  months or greater). See discussions on the latter point in the 2006  Interagency ALLL Policy Statement transmitted by Accounting Bulletin 06- 1 (December 2006). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">To be effective, management information systems need to track the  principal reductions and charge-off history of loans in workout programs  by type of program. Any decision to re-age, extend, defer, renew, or  rewrite a loan, like any other revision to contractual terms, needs to  be supported by the   credit union's management information systems. Sound management  information systems are able to identify and document any loan that is  re-aged, extended, deferred, renewed, or rewritten, including the  frequency and extent such action has been taken. Documentation normally  shows that the credit union's personnel communicated with the borrower,  the borrower agreed to pay the loan in full under any new terms, and the  borrower has the ability to repay the loan under any new terms.</p><p class="depth0">Regulatory Reporting of Workout Loans Including TDR Past Due Status</p><p class="depth0">The past due status of all loans will be calculated consistent with  loan contract terms, including amendments made to loan terms through a  formal restructure. Credit unions will report delinquency on the Call  Report consistent with this policy.\6\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\6\ Subsequent Call Reports and accompanying instructions will  reflect this policy, including focusing data collection on loans meeting  the definition of TDR under GAAP. In reporting TDRs on regulatory  reports, the data collections will include all TDRs that meet the GAAP  criteria for TDR reporting, without the application of materiality  threshold exclusions based on scoping or reporting policy elections of  credit union preparers or their auditors. Credit unions should also  refer to the recently revised standard from the FASB, Accounting  Standards Update No. 2011-02 (April 2011) to the FASB Accounting  Standards Codification entitled, Receivables (Topic 310), ``A Creditor's  Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt  Restructuring.'' This clarified the definition of a TDR, which has the  practical effect in the current economic environment to broaden loan  workouts that constitute a TDR.

The  balance of the policy relates to member business loan workouts and is  similar to the FFIEC policies adopted by the federal banking agencies  \8\ as set forth in the FFIEC Call Report for banking institutions and  its instructions.\9\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\7\ Placing a loan in nonaccrual status does not change the loan  agreement or the obligations between the borrower and the credit union.  Only the parties can effect a restructuring of the original loan terms  or otherwise settle the debt.</p><p class="depth0">\8\ The federal banking agencies are the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p><p class="depth0">\9\ FFIEC Report of Condition and Income Forms and User Guides,  Updated September 2011, http://www.fdic.gov. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Nonaccrual Status</p><p class="depth0">Credit unions may not accrue interest \10\ on any loan upon which  principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or  more, unless the loan is both ``well secured'' and ``in the process of  collection.'' \11\ Additionally, loans will be placed in nonaccrual  status if maintained on a Cash (or Cost Recovery) basis because of  deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower, or for which  payment in full of principal or interest is not expected. For purposes  of applying the ``well secured'' and ``in process of collection'' test  for nonaccrual status listed above, the date on which a loan reaches  nonaccrual status is determined by its contractual terms. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\10\ Nonaccrual of interest also includes the amortization of  deferred net loan fees or costs, or the accretion of discount.  Nonaccrual of interest on loans past due 90 days or more is a  longstanding agency policy and credit union practice.</p><p class="depth0">\11\ A purchased credit impaired loan asset need not be placed in  nonaccrual status as long as the criteria for accrual of income under  the interest method in GAAP is met. Also, the accrual of interest on  workout loans is covered in a separate section of this IRPS later in the  policy statement. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">While a loan is in nonaccrual status, some or all of the cash  interest payments received may be treated as interest income on a cash  basis as long as the remaining recorded investment in the loan (i.e.,  after charge-off of identified losses, if any) is deemed to be fully  collectable. The reversal of previously accrued, but uncollected,  interest applicable to any loan placed in nonaccrual status must be  handled in accordance with GAAP.\12\ Where   assets are collectable over an extended period of time and, because of  the terms of the transactions or other conditions, there is no  reasonable basis for estimating the degree of collectability--when such  circumstances exist, and as long as they exist--consistent with GAAP the  Cost Recovery Method of accounting must be used.\13\ Use of the Cash or  Cost Recovery basis for these loans and the statement on reversing  previous accrued interest is the practical implementation of relevant  accounting principles. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\12\ Acceptable accounting treatment includes a reversal of all  previously accrued, but uncollected, interest applicable to loans placed  in a nonaccrual status against appropriate income and balance sheet  accounts. For example, one acceptable method of accounting for such  uncollected interest on a loan placed in nonaccrual status is: (1) To  reverse all of the unpaid interest by crediting the ``accrued interest  receivable'' account on the balance sheet, (2) to reverse the  uncollected interest that has been accrued during the calendar year-to- date by debiting the appropriate ``interest and fee income on loans''  account on the income statement, and (3) to reverse any uncollected  interest that had been accrued during previous calendar years by  debiting the ``allowance for loan and lease losses'' account on the  balance sheet. The use of this method presumes that credit union  management's additions to the allowance through charges to the  ``provision for loan and lease losses'' on the income statement have  been based on an evaluation of the collectability of the loan and lease  portfolios and the ``accrued interest receivable'' account.</p><p class="depth0">\13\ When a purchased impaired loan or debt security that is  accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30, ``Receivables- Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality,''  has been placed on nonaccrual status, the cost recovery method should be  used, when appropriate. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Restoration to Accrual Status for All Loans except Member Business Loan</p><p class="depth0">Workouts</p><p class="depth0">A nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when:</p><p class="depth0">Its past due status is less than 90 days, GAAP does not  require it to be maintained on the Cash or Cost Recovery basis, and the  credit union is plausibly assured of repayment of the remaining  contractual principal and interest within a reasonable period;</p><p class="depth0">When it otherwise becomes both well secured and in the  process of collection; or</p><p class="depth0">The asset is a purchased impaired loan and it meets the  criteria under GAAP for accrual of income under the interest method  specified therein.</p><p class="depth0">In restoring all loans to accrual status, if any interest payments  received while the loan was in nonaccrual status were applied to reduce  the recorded investment in the loan the application of these payments to  the loan's recorded investment must not be reversed (and interest income  must not be credited). Likewise, accrued but uncollected interest  reversed or charged-off at the point the loan was placed on nonaccrual  status cannot be restored to accrual; it can only be recognized as  income if collected in cash or cash equivalents from the member.</p><p class="depth0">Restoration to Accrual Status on Member Business Loan Workouts \14\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\14\ This policy is derived from the ``Interagency Policy Statement  on Prudent Commercial Real Estate Loan Workouts'' NCUA and the other  financial regulators issued on October 30, 2009. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">A formally restructured member business loan workout need not be  maintained in nonaccrual status, provided the restructuring and any  charge-off taken on the loan are supported by a current, well documented  credit evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects  for repayment under the revised terms. Otherwise, the restructured loan  must remain in nonaccrual status. The evaluation must include  consideration of the borrower's sustained historical repayment  performance for a reasonable period prior to the date on which the loan  is returned to accrual status. A sustained period of repayment  performance would be a minimum of six consecutive payments and would  involve timely payments under the restructured loan's terms of principal  and interest in cash or cash equivalents. In returning the member  business workout loan to accrual status, sustained historical repayment  performance for a reasonable time prior to the restructuring may be  taken into account. Such a restructuring must improve the collectability  of the loan in accordance with a reasonable repayment schedule and does  not relieve the credit union from the responsibility to promptly charge  off all identified losses.</p><p class="depth0">The graph below provides an example of a schedule of repayment  performance to demonstrate a determination of six consecutive payments.  If the original loan terms required a monthly payment of $1,500, and the  credit union lowered the borrower's payment to $1,000 through formal  member business loan restructure, then based on the first row of the  graph, the ``sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable  time prior to the restructuring'' would encompass five of the pre- workout consecutive payments that were at least $1,000 (Months 1 through  5); so, in total, the six consecutive repayment burden would be met by  the first month post workout (Month 6). In the second row, only one of  the pre-workout payments would count toward the six consecutive  repayment requirement (Month 5), because it is the first month in which  the borrower made a payment of at least $1,000, after failing to pay at  least that amount. The loan, therefore, would remain on nonaccrual for  at least five post-workout consecutive payments (Months 6 through 10)  provided the borrower continues to make   payments consistent with the restructured terms.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Pre-workout                                              Post-workout ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Month 1     Month 2     Month 3     Month 4    Month 5    Month 6    Month 7    Month 8    Month 9    Month 10 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">$1,500      $1,200      $1,200      $1,000     $1,000     $1,000     $1,000     $1,000     $1,000     $1,000</p><p class="depth0">1,500       1,200         900         875      1,000      1,000      1,000      1,000      1,000      1,000 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">After a formal restructure of a member business loan, if the  restructured loan has been returned to accrual status, the loan  otherwise remains subject to the nonaccrual standards of this policy. If  any interest payments received while the member business loan was in  nonaccrual status were applied to reduce the recorded investment in the  loan the application of these payments to the loan's recorded investment  must not be reversed (and interest income must not be credited).  Likewise, accrued but uncollected interest reversed or charged-off at  the point the member business workout loan was placed on nonaccrual  status cannot be restored to accrual; it can only be recognized as  income if collected in cash or cash equivalents from the member.</p><p class="depth0">The following tables summarize nonaccrual and restoration to accrual  requirements previously discussed:</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Nonaccrual Criteria ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Additional</p><p class="depth0">Action             Condition identified      consideration ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Nonaccrual on All Loans.....  90 days or more past  See Glossary</p><p class="depth0">due unless loan is    descriptors for</p><p class="depth0">both well secured     ``well secured''</p><p class="depth0">and in the process    and ``in the</p><p class="depth0">of collection; or     process of</p><p class="depth0">If the loan must be    collection.''</p><p class="depth0">maintained on the    Consult GAAP for</p><p class="depth0">Cash or Cost          Cash or Cost</p><p class="depth0">Recovery basis        Recovery basis</p><p class="depth0">because there is a    income recognition</p><p class="depth0">deterioration in      guidance.

If  this method is used, the amount of income that is recognized would be  equal to that which would have been accrued on the loan's remaining  recorded investment at the contractual rate; and, (2) accounting for the  contractual interest in its entirety either as income, reduction of the  recorded investment in the asset, or recovery of prior charge-offs,  depending on the condition of the asset, consistent with its accounting  policies for other financial reporting purposes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">``Charge-off'' means a direct reduction (credit) to the carrying  amount of a loan carried at amortized cost resulting from  uncollectability with a corresponding reduction (debit) of the ALLL.  Recoveries of loans previously charged off should be recorded when  received.</p><p class="depth0">``Cost Recovery'' method of income recognition means equal amounts  of revenue and expense are recognized as collections are made until all  costs have been recovered, postponing any recognition of profit until  that time.\17\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\17\ FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605-10-25-4,  ``Revenue Recognition, Cost Recovery.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">``Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)'' means official  pronouncements of the FASB as memorialized in the FASB Accounting  Standards Codification[supreg] as the source of authoritative principles  and standards recognized to be applied in the preparation of financial  statements by federally-insured credit unions in the United States with  assets of $10 million or more.</p><p class="depth0">``In the process of collection'' means collection of the loan is  proceeding in due course either: (1) Through legal action, including  judgment enforcement procedures, or (2) in appropriate circumstances,  through collection efforts not involving legal action which are  reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its  restoration to a current status in the near future, i.e., generally  within the next 90 days.</p><p class="depth0">``Member Business Loan'' is defined consistent with Section 723.1 of  NCUA's Member Business Loan Rule, 12 CFR 723.1.</p><p class="depth0">``New Loan'' means the terms of the revised loan are at least as  favorable to the credit union (i.e., terms are market-based, and profit  driven) as the terms for comparable loans to other customers with  similar collection risks who are not refinancing or restructuring a loan  with the credit union, and the revisions to the original debt are more  than minor.</p><p class="depth0">``Past Due'' means a loan is determined to be delinquent in relation  to its contractual repayment terms including formal restructures, and  must consider the time value of money. Credit unions may use the  following method to recognize partial payments on ``consumer credit,''  i.e., credit extended to individuals for household, family, and other  personal expenditures, including credit cards, and loans to individuals  secured by their personal residence, including home equity and home  improvement loans. A payment equivalent to 90 percent or more of the  contractual payment may be considered a full payment in computing past  due status.</p><p class="depth0">``Recorded Investment in a Loan'' means the loan balance adjusted  for any unamortized premium or discount and unamortized loan fees or  costs, less any amount previously charged off, plus recorded accrued  interest.</p><p class="depth0">``Troubled Debt Restructuring'' is as defined in GAAP and means a  restructuring in which a credit union, for economic or legal reasons  related to a member borrower's financial difficulties, grants a  concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider.\18\ The  restructuring of a loan may include, but is not necessarily limited to:  (1) The transfer from the borrower to the credit union of real estate,  receivables from third parties, other assets, or an equity interest in  the borrower in full or partial satisfaction of the loan, (2) a  modification of the loan terms, such as a reduction of the stated  interest rate, principal, or accrued interest or an extension of the  maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market  rate for new debt with similar risk, or (3) a combination of the above.  A loan extended or renewed at a stated interest rate equal to the  current market interest rate for new debt with similar risk is not to be  reported as a restructured troubled loan. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\18\ FASB ASC 310-40, ``Troubled Debt Restructuring by Creditors.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">``Well secured'' means the loan is collateralized by: (1) A  perfected security interest in, or pledges of, real or personal  property, including securities with an estimable value, less cost to  sell, sufficient to recover the recorded investment in the loan, as well  as a reasonable return on that amount, or (2)   by the guarantee of a financially responsible party.</p><p class="depth0">``Workout Loan'' means a loan to a borrower in financial difficulty  that has been formally restructured so as to be reasonably assured of  repayment (of principal and interest) and of performance according to  its restructured terms. A workout loan typically involves a re-aging,  extension, deferral, renewal, or rewrite of a loan.\19\ For purposes of  this policy statement, workouts do not include loans made to market  rates and terms such as refinances, borrower retention actions, or new  loans.\20\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\19\ ``Re-Age'' means returning a past due account to current status  without collecting the total amount of principal, interest, and fees  that are contractually due.</p><p class="depth0">``Extension'' means extending monthly payments on a closed-end loan  and rolling back the maturity by the number of months extended. The  account is shown current upon granting the extension. If extension fees  are assessed, they should be collected at the time of the extension and  not added to the balance of the loan.</p><p class="depth0">``Deferral'' means deferring a contractually due payment on a  closed-end loan without affecting the other terms, including maturity,  of the loan. The account is shown current upon granting the deferral.</p><p class="depth0">``Renewal'' means underwriting a matured, closed-end loan generally  at its outstanding principal amount and on similar terms.</p><p class="depth0">``Rewrite'' means significantly changing the terms of an existing  loan, including payment amounts, interest rates, amortization schedules,  or its final maturity.</p><p class="depth0">\20\ There may be instances where a workout loan is not a TDR even  though the borrower is experiencing financial hardship. For example, a  workout loan would not be a TDR if the fair value of cash or other  assets accepted by a credit union from a borrower in full satisfaction  of its receivable is at least equal to the credit union's recorded  investment in the loan, e.g., due to charge-offs.
