Round the initial test  results to the number of decimal places contained in the applicable  emission standard expressed to one additional significant figure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Final test results for each test vehicle are calculated by  summing the initial test results derived in paragraph (a) of this  section for each test vehicle, dividing by the number of times that  specific test has been conducted on the vehicle, and rounding to the  same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard  expressed to one additional significant figure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final deteriorated test results. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each test vehicle. The  final deteriorated test results for each light-duty vehicle tested for  exhaust emissions and/or refueling emissions according to subpart B,  subpart C, or subpart R of this part are calculated by first multiplying  or adding, as appropriate, the final test results by or to the  appropriate deterioration factor derived from the certification process  for the engine or evaporative/refueling family and model year to which  the selected configuration belongs, and then by multiplying by the  appropriate reactivity adjustment factor, if applicable, and rounding to  the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission  standard. For the purpose of this paragraph (c), if a multiplicative  deterioration factor as computed during the certification process is  less than one, that deterioration factor is one. If an additive  deterioration factor as computed during the certification process is  less than zero, that deterioration factor will be zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. There are no deterioration factors for light-duty  vehicle emissions obtained during spitback testing in accordance with  Sec. 86.146. Accordingly, for the fuel dispensing spitback test, the  term ``final deteriorated test results'' means the final test   results derived in paragraph (b) of this section for each test vehicle,  rounded to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable  emission standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within five working days after completion of testing of all  vehicles pursuant to a test order, the manufacturer shall submit to the  Administrator a report which includes the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The location and description of the manufacturer's emission test  facilities which were utilized to conduct testing reported pursuant to  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicable standards against which the vehicles were tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deterioration factors for the selected configuration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the vehicle selection method used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each test conducted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Test vehicle description including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Configuration, engine family, and refueling family  identification.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Year, make, build date, and model of vehicle.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Vehicle Identification Number.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Miles accumulated on vehicle.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Location where mileage accumulation was conducted and  description of accumulation schedule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Test number, date initial test results, final results and  final deteriorated test results for all valid and invalid exhaust  emission tests, and the reason for invalidation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A complete description of any modification, repair,  preparation, maintenance and/or testing which was performed on the test  vehicle and:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Has not been reported pursuant to any other paragraph of this  subpart; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Will not be performed on all other production vehicles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Carbon dioxide emission values for all valid and invalid exhaust  emission tests.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Where a vehicle was deleted from the test sequence by  authorization of the Administrator, the reason for the deletion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Any other information the Administrator may request relevant  to the determination as to whether the new motor vehicles being  manufactured by the manufacturer do in fact conform with the regulations  with respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The following statement and endorsement:</p><p class="depth3">This report is submitted pursuant to sections 206 and 208 of the  Clean Air Act. This Selective Enforcement Audit was conducted in  complete conformance with all applicable regulations under 40 CFR part  86 and the conditions of the test order.
