                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">An applicant seeking type design approval for an engine to be installed on a two-engine airplane approved for ETOPS without the service experience specified in part 25, appendix K, K25.2.1 of this chapter, must comply with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The engine must be designed using a design quality process acceptable to the FAA, that ensures the design features of the engine minimize the occurrence of failures, malfunctions, defects, and maintenance errors that could result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The design features of the engine must address problems shown to result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss in the applicant's other relevant type designs approved within the past 10 years, to the extent that adequate service data is available within that 10-year period. An applicant without adequate service data must show experience with and knowledge of problem mitigating design practices equivalent to that gained from actual service experience in a manner acceptable to the FAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, the applicant must conduct a simulated ETOPS mission cyclic endurance test in accordance with an approved test plan on an engine that substantially conforms to the type design. The test must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Include a minimum of 3,000 representative service start-stop mission cycles and three simulated diversion cycles at maximum continuous thrust or power for the maximum diversion time for which ETOPS eligibility is sought. Each start-stop mission cycle must include the use of take-off, climb, cruise, descent, approach, and landing thrust or power and the use of thrust reverse (if applicable). The diversions must be evenly distributed over the duration of the test. The last diversion must be conducted within 100 cycles of the completion of the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Be performed with the high speed and low speed main engine rotors independently unbalanced to obtain a minimum of 90 percent of the recommended field service maintenance vibration levels. For engines with three main engine rotors, the intermediate speed rotor must be independently unbalanced to obtain a minimum of 90 percent of the recommended production acceptance vibration level. The required peak vibration levels must be verified during a slow acceleration and deceleration run of the test engine covering the main engine rotor operating speed ranges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Include a minimum of three million vibration cycles for each 60 rpm incremental step of the typical high-speed rotor start-stop mission cycle. The test may be conducted using any rotor speed step increment from 60 to 200 rpm provided the test encompasses the typical service start-stop cycle speed range. For incremental steps greater than 60 rpm, the minimum number of vibration cycles must be linearly increased up to ten million cycles for a 200 rpm incremental step.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Include a minimum of 300,000 vibration cycles for each 60 rpm incremental step of the high-speed rotor approved operational speed range between minimum flight idle and cruise power not covered by paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The test may be conducted using any rotor speed step increment from 60 to 200 rpm provided the test encompasses the applicable speed range. For incremental steps greater than 60 rpm the minimum number of vibration cycles must be linearly increased up to 1 million for a 200 rpm incremental step.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Include vibration surveys at periodic intervals throughout the test. The equivalent value of the peak vibration level observed during the surveys must meet the minimum vibration requirement of Sec. 33.201(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prior to the test required by paragraph (c) of this section, the engine must be subjected to a calibration test to document power and thrust characteristics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> At the conclusion of the testing required by paragraph (c) of this section, the engine must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Be subjected to a calibration test at sea-level conditions. Any change in power or thrust characteristics must be within approved limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Be visually inspected in accordance with the on-wing inspection recommendations and limits contained in the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness submitted in compliance with Sec. 33.4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Be completely disassembled and inspected--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In accordance with the applicable inspection recommendations and limits

contained in the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness submitted in compliance with Sec. 33.4;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With consideration of the causes of IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss identified by paragraph (b) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In a manner to identify wear or distress conditions that could result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss not specifically identified by paragraph (b) of this section or addressed within the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Not show wear or distress to the extent that could result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss within a period of operation before the component, assembly, or system would likely have been inspected or functionally tested for integrity while in service. Such wear or distress must have corrective action implemented through a design change, a change to maintenance instructions, or operational procedures before ETOPS eligibility is granted. The type and frequency of wear and distress that occurs during the engine test must be consistent with the type and frequency of wear and distress that would be expected to occur on ETOPS eligible engines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> An alternative mission cycle endurance test that provides an equivalent demonstration of the unbalance and vibration specified in paragraph (c) of this section may be used when approved by the FAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> For an applicant using the simulated ETOPS mission cyclic endurance test to comply with Sec. 33.90, the test may be interrupted so that the engine may be inspected by an on-wing or other method, using criteria acceptable to the FAA, after completion of the test cycles required to comply with Sec. 33.90(a). Following the inspection, the ETOPS test must be resumed to complete the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 33--Instructions for Continued Airworthiness</p><p class="depth0">a33.1 general</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This appendix specifies requirements for the preparation of Instructions for Continued Airworthiness as required by Sec. 33.4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Instructions for Continued Airworthiness for each engine must include the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness for all engine parts. If Instructions for Continued Airworthiness are not supplied by the engine part manufacturer for an engine part, the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness for the engine must include the information essential to the continued airworthiness of the engine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The applicant must submit to the FAA a program to show how changes to the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness made by the applicant or by the manufacturers of engine parts will be distributed.</p><p class="depth0">a33.2 format</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Instructions for Continued Airworthiness must be in the form of a manual or manuals as appropriate for the quantity of data to be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The format of the manual or manuals must provide for a practical arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">a33.3 content</p><p class="depth0">The contents of the manual or manuals must be prepared in the English language.
