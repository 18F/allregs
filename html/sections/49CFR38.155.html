Where on-board fare  collection devices are used, a horizontal passenger assist shall be  located between boarding passengers and the fare collection device and  shall prevent passengers from sustaining injuries on the fare collection  device or windshield in the event of a sudden deceleration. Without  restricting the vestibule space, the assist shall provide support for a  boarding passenger from the door through the boarding procedure.  Passengers shall be able to lean against the assist for security while  paying fares.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where provided within passenger compartments, handrails or  stanchions shall be sufficient to permit safe on-board circulation,  seating and standing assistance, and alighting by persons with  disabilities.</p>
