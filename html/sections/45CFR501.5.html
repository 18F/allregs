                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application to take. (1) An application to take a deposition must be in writing setting forth the reason why the deposition should be taken, the name and address of the witness, the matters concerning which it is expected the witness will testify, and the time and place proposed for the taking of the deposition, together with the name and address of the person before whom it is desired that the deposition be taken. If the deposition is being offered in connection with a hearing or examination, the application for deposition must be made to the Commission at least 15 days prior to the proposed date of such hearing or examination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An application to take a deposition must be in writing setting forth the reason why the deposition should be taken, the name and address of the witness, the matters concerning which it is expected the witness will testify, and the time and place proposed for the taking of the deposition, together with the name and address of the person before whom it is desired that the deposition be taken. If the deposition is being offered in connection with a hearing or examination, the application for deposition must be made to the Commission at least 15 days prior to the proposed date of such hearing or examination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application to take a deposition may be made during a hearing or examination, or subsequent to a hearing or examination, only where it is shown for good cause that the facts as set forth in the application to take the deposition were not within the knowledge of the person signing the application prior to the time of the hearing or examination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission or its representative will, upon receipt of the application and a showing of good cause, make and cause to be served upon the parties an order which will specify the name of the witness whose deposition is to be taken, the time, the place, and where practicable the designation of the officer before whom the witness is to testify. The officer may or may not be the one specified in the application. The order will be served upon all parties at least 10 days prior to the date of the taking of the deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Who may take. The deposition may be taken before the designated officer or, if none is designated, before any officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States. If the examination is held in a foreign country, it may be taken before a secretary of an embassy or legation, consul-general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examination and certification of testimony. At the time and place specified in the Commission's order, the officer taking the deposition will permit the witness to be examined and cross-examined under oath by all parties appearing, and the testimony will be reduced to writing by, or under the direction of, the presiding officer. All objections to questions or evidence will be deemed waived unless made in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. The officer will not have power to rule upon any objections but will note them upon the deposition. The testimony must be subscribed by the witness in the presence of the officer who will attach a certificate stating that the witness was duly sworn, that the deposition is a true record of the testimony and exhibits given by the witness and that the officer is not counsel or attorney to any of the interested parties. The officer will immediately seal and deliver an original and two copies of the transcript, together with the officer's certificate, by registered mail to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, Washington, DC 20579 or, if applicable, to the designated Commission field office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Admissibility in evidence. The deposition will be admissible in evidence, subject to such objections to the questions and answers as were noted at the time of taking the deposition, or within ten (10) days after the return thereof, and would be valid were the witness personally present at the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Errors and irregularities. All errors or irregularities occurring will be deemed waived unless a motion to suppress the deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable promptness after the defect is, or with due diligence might have been, ascertained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Scope of use. The deposition of a witness, if relevant, may be used if the Commission finds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the witness has died since the deposition was taken; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the witness is at a distance greater than 100 miles radius of Washington, DC, the designated field office or the designated place of the hearing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the witness is unable to attend because of other good cause shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Interrogatories and cross-interrogatories. Depositions may also be taken and submitted on written interrogatories in substantially the same manner as depositions taken by oral examination. When a deposition is taken upon interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, none of the parties may be present or represented, and no person, other than the witness, the person's representative or attorney, a stenographic reporter and the presiding officer, may be present at the examination of the witness, which fact will be certified by the officer, who will read the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories to the witness in their order and reduce the testimony to writing in the witness's own words.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fees. A witness whose deposition is taken pursuant to the regulations in this part, and the officer taking the deposition, will be entitled to the same fees and mileage allowed and paid for like service in the United States District Court for the district in which the deposition is taken. Such fees will be paid by the Commission or by the party at whose request the deposition is being taken.</p>
