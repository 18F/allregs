                                Sec. 102.85  Investigation of petition by regional director; consent
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Where a petition has been filed pursuant to Sec. 102.83, and it  appears to the regional director that the petitioner has made an  appropriate showing, in such form as the regional director may  determine, that 30 percent or more of the employees within a unit  covered by an agreement between their employer and a labor organization  requiring membership in such labor organization desire to rescind the  authority of such labor organization to make such an agreement, the  director shall proceed to conduct a secret ballot of the employees  involved on the question whether they desire to rescind the authority of  the labor organization to make such an agreement with their employer,  except that in any case in which it appears to the regional director  that the proceeding raises questions which cannot be decided without a  hearing, the director may issue and cause to be served on the parties a  notice of hearing before a hearing officer at a time and place fixed  therein. The regional director shall fix the time and place of the  election, eligibility requirements for voting, and other arrangements of  the balloting, but the parties may enter into an agreement, subject to  the approval of the regional director, fixing such arrangements. In any  such consent agreements, provision may be made for final determination  of all questions arising with respect to the balloting by the regional  director or, upon grant of a request for review, by the Board.
