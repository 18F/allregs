Sec. 9904.410-20  Purpose.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this Cost Accounting Standard is to provide criteria for the allocation of business unit general and administrative (G&A;) expenses to business unit final cost objectives based on their beneficial or causal relationship. These expenses represent the cost of the management and administration of the business unit as a whole. The Standard also provides criteria for the allocation of home office expenses received by a segment to the cost objectives of that segment. This Standard will increase the likelihood of achieving objectivity in the allocation of expenses to final cost objectives and comparability of cost data among contractors in similar circumstances.


Sec. 9904.410-30  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following are definitions of terms which are prominent in this standard. Other terms defined elsewhere in this part 99 shall have the meanings ascribed to them in those definitions unless paragraph (b) of this section, requires otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Allocate means to assign an item of cost or a group of items of cost, to one or more cost objectives. This term includes both direct assignment of cost and the reassignment of a share from an indirect cost pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Business unit means any segment of an organization, or an entire business organization which is not divided into segments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cost input means the cost, except G&A; expenses, which for contract costing purposes is allocable to the production of goods and services during a cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Cost objective means a function, organizational subdivision, contract or other work unit for which cost data are desired and for which provision is made to accumulate and measure the cost of processes, products, jobs, capitalized projects, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Final cost objective means a cost objective which has allocated to it both direct and indirect costs, and, in the contractor's accumulation systems, is one of the final accumulation points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> General and administrative (G&A;) expense means any management, financial, and other expense which is incurred by or allocated to a business unit and which is for the general management and administration of the business unit as a whole. G&A; expense does not include those management expenses whose beneficial or causal relationship to cost objectives can be more directly measured by a base other than a cost input base representing the total activity of a business unit during a cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Segment means one of two or more divisions, product departments, plants, or other subdivisions of an organization reporting directly to a home office, usually identified with responsibility for profit and/or producing a product or service. The terms include Government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities, and joint ventures and subsidiaries (domestic and foreign) in which the organization has a majority ownership. The term also includes those joint ventures and subsidiaries (domestic and foreign) in which the organization has less than a majority of ownership, but over which it exercises control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following modifications of terms defined elsewhere in this chapter 99 are applicable to this Standard: None.


Sec. 9904.410-40  Fundamental requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Business unit G&A; expenses shall be grouped in a separate indirect cost pool which shall be allocated only to final cost objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> The G&A; expense pool of a business unit for a cost accounting period shall be allocated to final cost objectives of that cost accounting period by means of a cost input base representing the total activity of the business unit except as provided in subparagraph (b)(2) of this subsection. The cost input base selected shall be the

one which best represents the total activity of a typical cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The G&A; expense pool of a business unit for a cost accounting period shall be allocated to final cost objectives of that cost accounting period by means of a cost input base representing the total activity of the business unit except as provided in subparagraph (b)(2) of this subsection. The cost input base selected shall be the

one which best represents the total activity of a typical cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The allocation of the G&A; expense pool to any particular final cost objectives which receive benefits significantly different from the benefits accruing to other final cost objectives shall be determined by special allocation (9904.410-50(j)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Home office expenses received by a segment shall be allocated to segment cost objectives as required by 9904.410-50(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Any costs which do not satisfy the definition of G&A; expense but which have been classified by a business unit as G&A; expenses, can remain in the G&A; expense pool unless they can be allocated to business unit cost objectives on a beneficial or causal relationship which is best measured by a base other than a cost input base.


Sec. 9904.410-50  Techniques for application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> G&A; expenses of a segment incurred by another segment shall be removed from the incurring segment's G&A; expense pool. They shall be allocated to the segment for which the expenses were incurred on the basis of the beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and all benefiting or causing segments. If the expenses are incurred for two or more segments, they shall be allocated using an allocation base common to all such segments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The G&A; expense pool may be combined with other expenses for allocation to final cost objectives provided that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The allocation base used for the combined pool is appropriate both for the allocation of the G&A; expense pool under this Standard and for the allocation of the other expenses; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provision is made to identify the components and total of the G&A; expense pool separately from the other expenses in the combined pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Expenses which are not G&A; expenses and are insignificant in amount may be included in the G&A; expense pool for allocation to final cost objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The cost input base used to allocate the G&A; expense pool shall include all significant elements of that cost input which represent the total activity of the business unit. The cost input base selected to represent the total activity of a business unit during a cost accounting period may be: Total cost input; value-added cost input; or single element cost input. The determination of which cost input base best represents the total activity of a business unit must be judged on the basis of the circumstances of each business unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A total cost input base is generally acceptable as an appropriate measure of the total activity of a business unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Value-added cost input shall be used as an allocation base where inclusion of material and subcontract costs would significantly distort the allocation of the G&A; expense pool in relation to the benefits received, and where costs other than direct labor are significant measures of total activity. A value-added cost input base is total cost input less material and subcontract costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A single element cost input base; e.g., direct labor hours or direct labor dollars, which represents the total activity of a business unit may be used to allocate the G&A; expense pool where it produces equitable results. A single element base may not produce equitable results where other measures of activity are also significant in relation to total activity. A single element base is inappropriate where it is an insignificant part of the total cost of some of the final cost objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Where, prior to the effective date of this Standard, a business unit's disclosed or established cost accounting practice was to use a cost of sales or sales base, that business unit may use the transition method set out in appendix A hereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Cost input shall include those expenses which by operation of this Standard are excluded from the G&A; expense pool and are not part of a combined pool of G&A; expenses and other expenses allocated using the same allocation base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)(1)</em> Allocations of the home office expenses of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Allocations of the home office expenses of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Line management of particular segments or groups of segments,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Residual expenses, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Directly allocated expenses related to the management and administration of the receiving segment as a whole, shall be included in the receiving segment's G&A; expense pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any separate allocation of the expenses of home office centralized service functions, staff management of specific activities of segments, and central payments or accruals, which is received by a segment, shall be allocated to the segment cost objectives in proportion to the beneficial or causal relationship between the cost objectives and the expense if such allocation is significant in amount. Where a beneficial or causal relationship for the expense is not identifiable with segment cost objectives, the expense may be included in the G&A; expense pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Where a segment performs home office functions and also performs as an operating segment having a responsibility for final cost objectives, the expense of the home office functions shall be segregated. These expenses shall be allocated to all benefiting or causing segments, including the segment performing the home office functions, pursuant to disclosed or established accounting practices for the allocation of home office expenses to segments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of allocating the G&A; expense pool, items produced or worked on for stock or product inventory shall be accounted for as final cost objectives in accordance with the following paragraphs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where items are produced or worked on for stock or product inventory in a given cost accounting period, the cost input to such items in that period shall be included only once in the computation of the G&A; expense allocation base and in the computation of the G&A; expense allocation rate for that period and shall not be included in the computation of the base or rate for any other cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A portion of the G&A; expense pool shall be allocated to items produced or worked on for stock or product inventory in the cost accounting period or periods in which such items are produced at the rates determined for such periods except as provided in subparagraph (i)(3) of this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where the contractor does not include G&A; expense in inventory as part of the cost of stock or product inventory items, the G&A; rate of the cost accounting period in which such items are issued to final cost objectives may be used to determine the G&A; expenses applicable to issues of stock or product inventory items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Where a particular final cost objective in relation to other final cost objectives receives significantly more or less benefit from G&A; expense than would be reflected by the allocation of such expenses using a base determined pursuant to paragraph (d) of this subsection, the business unit shall account for this particular final cost objective by a special allocation from the G&A; expense pool to the particular final cost objective commensurate with the benefits received. The amount of a special allocation to any such final cost objective shall be excluded from the G&A; expense pool required by 9904.410-40(a), and the particular final cost objective's cost input data shall be excluded from the base used to allocate this pool.


Sec. 9904.410-60  Illustrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Business Unit A has been including the cost of scientific computer operations in its G&A; expense pool. The scientific computer is used predominantly for research and development, rather than for the management and administration of the business unit as a whole. The costs of the scientific computer operation do not satisfy the Standard's definition of G&A; expense; however, they may remain in the G&A; expense pool unless they can be allocated to business unit cost objectives on a beneficial or causal relationship which is best measured by a base other than a cost input base representing the total activity of a business unit during a cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Segment B performs a budgeting function, the cost of which is included in its G&A; expense pool. This function includes the preparation of budgets for another segment. The cost of preparing the budgets for the other segment should be removed from B's G&A; expense pool and transferred to the other segment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> Business Unit C has a personnel function which is divided into two parts: A vice president of personnel who establishes personnel policy and overall guidance, and a personnel department which handles hirings, testing, evaluations, etc. The expense of the vice president is included in the G&A; expense pool. The expense of the personnel department is allocated to the other indirect cost pools based on the beneficial or causal relationship between that expense and the indirect cost pools. This procedure is in compliance with the requirements of this Standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Business Unit C has a personnel function which is divided into two parts: A vice president of personnel who establishes personnel policy and overall guidance, and a personnel department which handles hirings, testing, evaluations, etc. The expense of the vice president is included in the G&A; expense pool. The expense of the personnel department is allocated to the other indirect cost pools based on the beneficial or causal relationship between that expense and the indirect cost pools. This procedure is in compliance with the requirements of this Standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Business Unit C has included selling costs as part of its G&A; expense pool. Unit C wishes to continue to include selling costs in its G&A; pool. Under the provisions of this Standard, Unit C may continue to include selling costs in its G&A; pool, and these costs will be allocated over a cost input base selected in accordance with the provisions of 9904.410-50(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Business Unit C has included IR&D; and B&P; costs in its G&A; expense pool. Unit C has used a cost of sales base to allocate its G&A; expense pool. As of January 1, 1978 (assumed for purposes of this illustration), the date on which Unit C must first allocate its G&A; expense pool in accordance with the requirements of this Standard, Unit C has among its final cost objectives several cost reimbursement contracts and fixed price contracts subject to the CAS clause (referred to as the preexisting contracts). If Unit C chooses to use the transition method in 9904.410-50(e):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Unit C shall allocate IR&D; and B&P; costs during the transition period (from January 1, 1978, to and including the cost accounting period during which the preexisting contracts are completed), to the preexisting contracts as part of its G&A; expense pool using a cost of sales base pursuant to 9904.410-50(e) and appendix A to 9904.410.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> During the transition period such costs, as part of the G&A; expense pool, shall be allocated to new cost reimbursement contracts and new fixed price contracts subject to the CAS clause using a cost input base as required by 9904.410-50 (d) and (e) and appendix A to 9904.410.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Beginning with the cost accounting period after the transition period the IR&D; and B&P; costs, as part of the G&A; expense pool, shall be allocated to all final cost objectives using a cost input base as required by 9904.410-50(d). If Unit C chooses not to use the transition method in 9904.410-50(e), the contractual provision requiring appropriate equitable adjustment of the prices of affected prime contracts and subcontracts will be implemented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Business Unit C has accounted for and allocated IR&D; and B&P; costs in a cost pool separate and apart from the G&A; expense pool. Unit C may continue to account for these costs in a separate cost pool under the provision of this Standard. If Unit C is to use a total cost input base, these costs when accounted for and allocated in a cost pool separate and apart from the G&A; expense pool will become part of the total cost input base used by Unit C to allocate the G&A; expense pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Business Unit C has included selling costs as part of its G&A; expense pool. Unit C has used a cost of sales base to allocate the G&A; expense pool. Unit C desires to continue to allocate selling costs using the costs of sales base. Under the provisions of this Standard, Unit C would account for selling costs as a cost pool separate and apart from the G&A; expense pool, and continue to allocate these costs over a cost of sales base. If Unit C uses a total cost input base to allocate the G&A; expense pool, the selling costs will become part of the total cost input base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em> Business Unit D has accounted for selling costs in a cost pool separate and apart from its G&A; expense pool and has allocated these costs using a cost of sales base. Under the provisions of this Standard, Unit D may continue to account for those costs in a separate pool and allocate them using a cost of sales base. Unit D has a total cost input base to allocate its G&A; expense pool. The selling costs will become part of the cost input base used by Unit D to allocate the G&A; expense pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Business Unit D has accounted for selling costs in a cost pool separate and apart from its G&A; expense pool and has allocated these costs using a cost of sales base. Under the provisions of this Standard, Unit D may continue to account for those costs in a separate pool and allocate them using a cost of sales base. Unit D has a total cost input base to allocate its G&A; expense pool. The selling costs will become part of the cost input base used by Unit D to allocate the G&A; expense pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> During a cost accounting period, Business Unit D buys $2,000,000 of raw

materials. At the end of that cost accounting period, $500,000 of raw materials inventory have not been charged out to contracts or other cost objectives. The $500,000 of raw materials are not part of the total cost input base for the cost accounting period, because they have not been charged to the production of goods and services during that period. If all of the $2,000,000 worth of raw material had been charged to cost objectives during the cost accounting period, the cost input base for the allocation of the G&A; expense pool would include the entire $2,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Business Unit D manufactures a variety of testing devices. During a cost accounting period, Unit D acquires and uses a small building, constructs a small production facility using its own resources, and keeps for its own use one unit of a testing device that it manufactures and sells to its customers. The acquisition cost of the building is not part of the total cost input base; however, the depreciation taken on the building would be part of the total cost input base. The costs of construction of the small production facility are not part of the total cost input base. The requirements of 9904.404 provide that those G&A; expenses which are identifiable with the constructed asset and are material in amount shall be capitalized as part of the cost of the production facility. If there are G&A; expenses material in amount and identified with the constructed asset, these G&A; expenses would be removed from the G&A; expense pool prior to the allocation of this pool to final cost objectives. The cost of the testing device shall be part of the total cost input base per the requirements of 9904.404 which provides that the costs of constructed assets identical with the contractor's regular product shall include a full share of indirect cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(1)</em> Business Unit E produces Item Z for stock or product inventory. The business unit does not include G&A; expense as part of the inventory cost of these items for costing or financial reporting purposes. A production run of these items occurred during Cost Accounting Period 1. A number of the units produced were not issued during Period 1 and are issued in Period 2. However, those units produced in Period 1 shall be included in the cost input of that period for calculating the G&A; expense allocation base and shall not be included in the cost input of Period 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Business Unit E produces Item Z for stock or product inventory. The business unit does not include G&A; expense as part of the inventory cost of these items for costing or financial reporting purposes. A production run of these items occurred during Cost Accounting Period 1. A number of the units produced were not issued during Period 1 and are issued in Period 2. However, those units produced in Period 1 shall be included in the cost input of that period for calculating the G&A; expense allocation base and shall not be included in the cost input of Period 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Business Unit E should apply the G&A; expense rate of Period 1 to those units of Item Z issued during Period 1 and may apply the rate of Period 2 to the units issued in Period 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the practice of Business Unit E is to include G&A; expense as part of the cost of stock or product inventory, the inventory cost of all units of Item Z produced in Period 1 and remaining in inventory at the end of Period 1, should include G&A; expense using the G&A; rate of Period 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(1)</em> Business Unit F produced Item X for stock or product inventory. The business unit does not include G&A; expense as part of the inventory cost of these items. A production run of these items was started, finished, and placed into inventory in a single cost accounting period. These items are issued during the next cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Business Unit F produced Item X for stock or product inventory. The business unit does not include G&A; expense as part of the inventory cost of these items. A production run of these items was started, finished, and placed into inventory in a single cost accounting period. These items are issued during the next cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The cost of items produced for stock or product inventory should be included in the G&A; base in the same year they are produced. The cost of such items is not to be included in the G&A; base on the basis of when they are issued to final cost objectives. Therefore, the time of issuance of these items from inventory to a final cost objective is irrelevant in computing the G&A; base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The normal productive activity of Business Unit G includes the construction of base operating facilities for others. Unit G uses a total cost input base to allocate G&A; expense to final cost objectives. As part of a contract to construct an operating facility, Unit G agrees to acquire a large group of trucks and other mobile equipment to equip the base operating facility. Unit G does not usually supply such equipment. The cost of the equipment constitutes a significant part of the contract cost. A special G&A; allocation to this contract shall be agreed to by the parties if they agree that in the circumstances the contract as a whole receives substantially less benefit from the G&A; expense pool than that which

would be represented by a cost allocation based on inclusion of the contract cost in the total cost input base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)(1)</em> The home office of Segment H separately allocates to benefiting or causing segments significant home office expenses of staff management functions relative to manufacturing, staff management functions relative to engineering, central payment of health insurance costs, and residual expenses. Segment H receives these expenses as separate allocations and maintains three indirect cost pools; i.e., G&A; expense, manufacturing overhead, and engineering overhead; all home office expenses allocated to Segment H are included in Segment H's G&A; expense pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The home office of Segment H separately allocates to benefiting or causing segments significant home office expenses of staff management functions relative to manufacturing, staff management functions relative to engineering, central payment of health insurance costs, and residual expenses. Segment H receives these expenses as separate allocations and maintains three indirect cost pools; i.e., G&A; expense, manufacturing overhead, and engineering overhead; all home office expenses allocated to Segment H are included in Segment H's G&A; expense pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This accounting practice of Segment H does not comply with 9904.410-50(g)(2). Home office residual expenses should be in the G&A; expense pool, and the expenses of the staff management functions relative to manufacturing and engineering should be included in the manufacturing overhead and engineering overhead pools, respectively. The health insurance costs should be allocated in proportion to the beneficial and causal relationship between these costs and Segment H's cost objectives.

As of January 3, 1978, Business Unit R has the following contracts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contract I--A 4-year contract awarded in January 1975.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contract II--A 3-year contract which was negotiated in March 1976, and was awarded on October 2, 1976.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Contract III--A 4-year contract awarded on January 2, 1978.</p><p class="depth0">If Business Unit R chooses to use the transition method provided in 9904.410-50(e), it will allocate the G&A; expense pool to these contracts as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Contract I--Since Contract I was in existence prior to January 1, 1978, the G&A; expense pool shall be allocated to it using a cost of sales base as provided in 9904.410-50(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contract II--Since this contract was in existence prior to January 1, 1978, the G&A; expense pool shall be allocated to it using a cost of sales base as provided in 9904.410-50(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Contract III--Since this contract was awarded after January 1, 1978, the G&A; expense pool shall be allocated to this contract using a cost input base.</p><p class="depth0">Having chosen to use 9904.410-50(e), Business Unit R will use the transition method of allocating the G&A; expense pool to final cost objectives until all contracts awarded prior to January 1, 1978, are completed (1979 if the contracts are completed on schedule). Beginning with the cost accounting period subsequent to that time, 1980, Unit R will use a cost input base to allocate the G&A; expense pool to all cost objectives. Unit R will also carry forward an inventory suspense account in accordance with the requirements of this Standard.</p><p class="depth0">2.A.
