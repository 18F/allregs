                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policies in force on October 17, 2003, or renewed or issued on or before January 15, 2004. For policies in force on October 17, 2003, or renewed or issued on or before January 15, 2004, the disclosure required by section 103(b) of the Act as a condition for Federal payment is waived for those State residual market insurance entities and State workers' compensation funds that since November 26, 2002, have not provided disclosures to policyholders, until January 15, 2004, after which disclosures are to be made to policyholders for policies then in force and subsequently issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Residual Market Mechanism Disclosure. A State residual market insurance entity or State workers' compensation fund may provide the disclosures required by this subpart B to policyholders using normal business practices, including forms and methods of communication used to communicate similar policyholder information to policyholders. The disclosures may be made by the State residual market insurance entity or State workers' compensation fund itself, the individual insurers that participate in the State residual market insurance entity or a State workers' compensation fund, or its servicing carriers. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the disclosure requirements have been met rests with the insurer filing a claim under the Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other requirements. Except as provided in this section, all other disclosure requirements set out in this subpart B apply to State residual insurance market entities and State workers' compensation funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior safe harbor superseded. This section supersedes the disclosure safe harbor provisions found at paragraph C.4 of the Interim Guidance issued by Treasury in a notice published on December 18, 2002, and published at 67 FR 78864 (December 26, 2002).
