                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Business information provided to the Office by a  business submitter shall not be disclosed pursuant to a FOIA request  except in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice to business submitters. The Office shall provide a  business submitter with prompt written notice of a request encompassing  its business information whenever required under paragraph (c) of this  section, except as is provided in paragraph (g) of this section, and  only to the extent permitted by law. Such written notice shall either  describe the exact nature of the business information requested or  provide copies of the records or portions thereof containing the  business information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When notice is required. For business information submitted to  the Office it shall provide a business submitter with notice of a  request whenever the business submitter has in good faith designated the  information as commercially or financially sensitive, or the Office has  reason to believe that disclosure of the information may result in  commercial or financial injury to the business submitter. Notice of a  request for business information falling within the former category  shall be required for a period of not more than ten years after the date  of submission   unless the business submitter requests, and provides acceptable  justification for, a specific notice period of greater duration.  Whenever possible, the submitter's claim of confidentiality should be  supported by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized  representative of the company that the information in question is in  fact confidential commercial or financial information and has not been  disclosed to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Opportunity to object to disclosure. Through the notice  described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Office shall afford a  business submitter a reasonable period within which to provide the  Office with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such  statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the  information under any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of  Exemption 4, shall demonstrate why the information is contended to be a  trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged  or confidential. Information provided by a business submitter pursuant  to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice of intent to disclose. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Office shall consider  carefully a business submitter's objections and specific grounds for  nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose business  information. Whenever the Office decides to disclose business  information over the objection of a business submitter, the Office shall  forward to the business submitter a written notice which shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement of the reasons for which the business submitter's  disclosure objections were not sustained;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A specified disclosure date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such notice of intent to disclose shall be forwarded a  reasonable number of days, as circumstances permit, prior to the  specified date upon which disclosure is intended. A copy of such  disclosure notice shall be forwarded to the requester at the same time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester brings suit seeking  to compel disclosure of business information covered by paragraph (c) of  this section, the Office shall promptly notify the business submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements of  this section shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Office determines that the information should not be  disclosed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made  available to the public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5  U.S.C. 552); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Office is a criminal law-enforcement agency that acquired  information in the course of a lawful investigation of a possible  violation of criminal law.</p>
