For purposes of this subpart, a ``major conversion'' means a conversion that substantially changes the dimensions or carrying capacity of the vessel or aircraft, changes the type of the vessel or aircraft, substantially prolongs the life of the vessel or aircraft, or otherwise so changes the vessel or aircraft that it is essentially a new vessel or aircraft, as determined by Customs (see 46 U.S.C. 2101(14a)).</p>
