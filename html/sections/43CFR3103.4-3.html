                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certification. The operator/payor must use the applicable  royalty rate when submitting the required royalty reports/payments to  the Minerals Management Service (MMS). In submitting royalty reports/ payments using a royalty rate reduction the operator/payor must certify  that the API oil gravity for the initial and subsequent 12-month periods  was not subject to manipulation or adulteration and the royalty rate was  determined in accordance with the requirements and procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agency action. If an operator/payor incorrectly calculates the  royalty rate, the BLM will determine the correct rate and notify the  operator/payor in writing. Any additional royalties due are payable to  MMS immediately upon receipt of this notice. Late payment or  underpayment charges will be assessed in accordance with 30 CFR 218.102.  The BLM will terminate a royalty rate reduction for a property if BLM  determines that the API oil gravity was manipulated or adulterated by  the operator/payor. Terminations of royalty rate reductions for  individual properties will be effective on the effective date of the  royalty rate reduction resulting from a manipulated or adulterated API  oil gravity so that the termination will be retroactive to the effective  date of the improper reduction. The operator/payor must pay the  difference in royalty resulting from the retroactive application of the  non-manipulated rate. The late payment or underpayment charges will  assessed in accordance with 30 CFR 218.102.  [61 FR 4750, Feb. 8, 1996, as amended at 75 FR 61626, Oct. 6, 2010]</p>
