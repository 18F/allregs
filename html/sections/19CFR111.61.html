                            <p class="depth0">The port director will prepare a summary of any oral presentations made by the broker or his attorney and forward it to the Assistant Commissioner together with a copy of each paper filed by the broker. The port director will also give to the Assistant Commissioner his recommendation on action to be taken as a result of the preliminary proceedings. If the Assistant Commissioner determines that the broker

has satisfactorily responded to the proposed charges and that further proceedings are not warranted, he will so inform the port director who will notify the broker. If no response is filed by the broker or if the Assistant Commissioner determines that the broker has not satisfactorily responded to all of the proposed charges, he will advise the port director of that fact and instruct him to prepare, sign, and serve a notice of charges and the statement of charges. If one or more of the charges in the proposed statement of charges was satisfactorily answered by the broker in the preliminary proceedings, the Assistant Commissioner will instruct the port director to omit those charges from the statement of charges.</p>
