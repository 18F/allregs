The accreditation body shall accept the following responsibilities in order to ensure safe and accurate mammography at the facilities it accredits and shall perform these responsibilities in a manner that ensures the integrity and impartiality of accreditation body actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> When an accreditation body receives or discovers information that suggests inadequate image quality, or upon request by FDA, the accreditation body shall review a facility's clinical images or other aspects of a facility's practice to assist FDA in determining whether or not the facility's practice poses a serious risk to human health. Such reviews are in addition to the evaluation an accreditation body performs as part of the initial accreditation or renewal process for facilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When an accreditation body receives or discovers information that suggests inadequate image quality, or upon request by FDA, the accreditation body shall review a facility's clinical images or other aspects of a facility's practice to assist FDA in determining whether or not the facility's practice poses a serious risk to human health. Such reviews are in addition to the evaluation an accreditation body performs as part of the initial accreditation or renewal process for facilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If review by the accreditation body demonstrates that a problem does exist with respect to image quality or other aspects of a facility's compliance with quality standards, or upon request by FDA, the accreditation body shall

require or monitor corrective actions, or suspend or revoke accreditation of the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The accreditation body shall inform FDA as soon as possible but in no case longer than 2 business days after becoming aware of equipment or practices that pose a serious risk to human health.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The accreditation body shall establish and administer a quality assurance (QA) program that has been approved by FDA in accordance with Sec. 900.3(d) or paragraph (a)(8) of this section. Such quality assurance program shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include requirements for clinical image review and phantom image review;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ensure that clinical and phantom images are evaluated consistently and accurately; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Specify the methods and frequency of training and evaluation for clinical and phantom image reviewers, and the bases and procedures for removal of such reviewers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The accreditation body shall establish measures that FDA has approved in accordance with Sec. 900.3(d) or paragraph (a)(8) of this section to reduce the possibility of conflict of interest or facility bias on the part of individuals acting on the body's behalf. Such individuals who review clinical or phantom images under the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section or who visit facilities under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section shall not review clinical or phantom images from or visit a facility with which such individuals maintain a relationship, or when it would otherwise be a conflict of interest for them to do so, or when they have a bias in favor of or against the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The accreditation body may require specific equipment performance or design characteristics that FDA has approved. However, no accreditation body shall require, either explicitly or implicitly, the use of any specific brand of imaging system or component, measuring device, software package, or other commercial product as a condition for accreditation by the body, unless FDA determines that it is in the best interest of public health to do so.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any representation, actual or implied, either orally, in sales literature, or in any other form of representation, that the purchase or use of a particular product brand is required in order for any facility to be accredited or certified under Sec. 900.11(b), is prohibited, unless FDA approves such representation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unless FDA has approved the exclusive use and promotion of a particular commercial product in accordance with this section, all products produced, distributed, or sold by an accreditation body or an organization that has a financial or other relationship with the accreditation body that may be a conflict of interest or have the appearance of a conflict of interest with the body's accreditation functions, shall bear a disclaimer stating that the purchase or use of such products is not required for accreditation or certification of any facility under Sec. 900.11(b). Any representations about such products shall include a similar disclaimer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When an accreditation body denies accreditation to a facility, the accreditation body shall notify the facility in writing and explain the bases for its decision. The notification shall also describe the appeals process available from the accreditation body for the facility to contest the decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> No accreditation body may establish requirements that preclude facilities from being accredited under Sec. 900.11(b) by any other accreditation body, or require accreditation by itself under MQSA if another accreditation body is available to a facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The accreditation body shall obtain FDA authorization for any changes it proposes to make in any standards that FDA has previously accepted under Sec. 900.3(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> An accreditation body shall establish procedures to protect confidential information it collects or receives in its role as an accreditation body.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Nonpublic information collected from facilities for the purpose of carrying out accreditation body responsibilities shall not be used for any other purpose or disclosed, other than to FDA or its duly designated representatives, including State agencies, without the consent of the facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Nonpublic information that FDA or its duly designated representatives, including State agencies, share with the accreditation body concerning a facility that is accredited or undergoing accreditation by that body shall not be further disclosed except with the written permission of FDA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring facility compliance with quality standards.

The accreditation body's QA program shall include a tracking system to ensure the security and return to the facility of all clinical images received and to ensure completion of all clinical image reviews by the body in a timely manner. The accreditation body shall return all clinical images to the facility within 60 days of their receipt by the body, with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the clinical images are needed earlier by the facility for clinical purposes, the accreditation body shall cooperate with the facility to accommodate such needs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a review physician identifies a suspicious abnormality on an image submitted for clinical image review, the accreditation body shall ensure that this information is provided to the facility and that the clinical images are returned to the facility. Both shall occur no later than 10-business days after identification of the suspected abnormality.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Notification of unsatisfactory image quality.
