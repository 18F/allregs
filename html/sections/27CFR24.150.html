                            <p class="depth0">Each bond, and each consent to changes in the terms of a bond, will  be accompanied by a power of attorney whereby the surety authorizes the  agent or officer who executed the bond or consent to act on behalf of  the surety. The appropriate TTB officer may require additional evidence  of the authority of the agent or officer of the surety to execute the  bond or consent. The power of attorney will be prepared on a form  provided by the surety and executed under the corporate seal of the  surety. If the power of attorney is other than a manually signed  original, the appropriate TTB officer may require a certification of  validity.  (July 30, 1947, Ch. 390, Pub.
