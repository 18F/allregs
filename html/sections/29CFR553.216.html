                            <p class="depth0">Although the 1974 Amendments to the FLSA provided special exemptions for employees of public agencies engaged in fire protection and law enforcement activities, such workers may also be subject to other exemptions in the Act, and public agencies may claim such other applicable exemptions in lieu of sections 13(b)(20) and 7(k). For example, section 13(a)(1) provides a complete minimum wage and overtime pay exemption for any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as those terms are defined and delimited in 29 CFR part 541. The section 13(a)(1) exemption can be claimed for any fire protection or law enforcement employee who meets all of the tests specified in part 541 relating to duties, responsibilities, and salary. Thus, high ranking police officials who are engaged in law enforcement activities, may also, depending on the facts, qualify for the section 13(a)(1) exemption as ``executive'' employees. Similarly, certain criminal investigative agents may qualify as ``administrative'' employees under section 13(a)(1). However, the election to take the section 13(a)(1) exemption for an employee who qualifies for it will not result in excluding that employee from the count that must be made to determine the application of the section 13(b)(20) exemption to the agency's other employees.</p><p class="depth0">Tour of Duty and Compensable Hours of Work Rules


Sec. 553.220  ``Tour of duty'' defined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term ``tour of duty'' is a unique concept applicable only to employees for whom the section 7(k) exemption is claimed. This term, as used in section 7(k), means the period of time during which an employee is considered to be on duty for purposes of determining compensable hours. It may be a scheduled or unscheduled period. Such periods include ``shifts'' assigned to employees often days in advance of the performance of the work. Scheduled periods also include time spent in work outside the ``shift'' which the public agency employer assigns. For example, a police officer may be assigned to crowd control during a parade or other special event outside of his or her shift.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unscheduled periods include time spent in court by police officers, time spent handling emergency situations, and time spent working after a shift to complete an assignment. Such time must be included in the compensable tour of duty even though the specific work performed may not have been assigned in advance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The tour of duty does not include time spent working for a separate and independent employer in certain types of special details as provided in Sec. 553.227. The tour of duty does not include time spent working on an occasional or sporadic and part-time basis in a different capacity from the regular work as provided in Sec. 553.30. The tour of duty does not include time spent substituting for other employees by mutual agreement as specified in Sec. 553.31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The tour of duty does not include time spent in volunteer firefighting or law enforcement activities performed for a different jurisdiction, even where such activities take place under the terms of a mutual aid agreement in the jurisdiction in which the employee is employed. (See Sec. 553.105.)</p>
