Bulk cargo loaded into intermodal equipment, except LASH or Seabee barges, is subject to mark and count and, therefore, ceases to be bulk cargo.</p><p class="depth0">Employee assigned to the contract means an employee who was hired after November 6, 1986 (after November 27, 2009, in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), who is directly performing work, in the United States, under a contract that is required to include the clause prescribed at 22.1803. An employee is not considered to be directly performing work under a contract if the employee--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Normally performs support work, such as indirect or overhead functions; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Does not perform any substantial duties applicable to the contract.</p><p class="depth2">Subcontract means any contract, as defined in 2.101, entered into by a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of a prime contract or a subcontract.
