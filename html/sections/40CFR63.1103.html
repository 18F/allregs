A common connector is a flange. Joined fittings welded completely around the circumference of the interface are not considered connectors for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Equipment means each pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, and instrumentation system in hydrogen fluoride service; and any control devices or closed-vent systems used to comply with this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Hydrogen fluoride production means a process engaged in the production and recovery of hydrogen fluoride by reacting calcium fluoride with sulfuric acid. For the purpose of implementing this subpart, hydrogen fluoride production is not a process that produces gaseous hydrogen fluoride for direct reaction with hydrated aluminum to form aluminum fluoride (i.e., the hydrogen fluoride is not recovered as an intermediate or final product prior to reacting with the hydrated aluminum).</p><p class="depth0">In hydrogen fluoride service means that a piece of equipment either contains or contacts a hydrogen fluoride process fluid (liquid or gas).</p><p class="depth0">In vacuum service means that equipment is operating at an internal pressure which is at least 5 kilopascals below ambient pressure.</p><p class="depth0">Instrumentation system means a group of equipment components used to condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions (e.g., composition, pressure, flow, etc.). Valves and connectors are the predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, other types of equipment may also be included in these systems.</p><p class="depth0">Kiln seal means the mechanical or hydraulic seals at both ends of the kiln, designed to prevent the infiltration of moisture and air through the interface of the rotating kiln and stationary pipes and equipment attached to the kiln during normal vacuum operation of the kiln (operation at an internal pressure of at least 0.25 kilopascal [one inch of water] below ambient pressure).</p><p class="depth0">Leakless pump means a pump whose seals are submerged in liquid, a magnetically-driven pump, a pump equipped with a dual mechanical seal system that includes a barrier fluid system, a canned pump, or other pump that is designed with no externally actuated shaft penetrating the pump housing.</p><p class="depth0">Open-ended valve or line means any valve, except relief valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with process fluid and one side open to the atmosphere, either directly or through open piping.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum

allowable working pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.</p><p class="depth0">Relief device or valve means a valve used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge. A relief valve discharge can result from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.</p><p class="depth0">Repaired for the purpose of this regulation means equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak identified by sensory monitoring.</p><p class="depth0">Sampling connection system means an assembly of equipment within a process unit or affected facility used during periods of representative operation to take samples of the process fluid.

Polycarbonate may be produced by solution or emulsion polymerization, although other methods may be used.
