                            <p class="depth0">Every effort will be made to avoid acquiring chattel property by  having the borrower or FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 liquidate the property according to Subpart A of Part 1962 of  this chapter and apply the proceeds to the borrower's account(s).  Methods of acquisition authorized are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purchase at the following types of sale: (1) Execution sale  conducted by the U.S. Marshal, sheriff or other party acting under Court  order to satisfy judgment liens.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  foreclosure sale conducted by the U.S. Marshal or sheriff in States  where a State Supplement provides for sales to be conducted by them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sale by trustee in bankruptcy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Public sale by prior lienholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Public sale conducted under the terms of Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 455-4, ``Agreement for  Voluntary Liquidation of Chattel Security,'' the power of sale in  security agreements or crop and chattel mortgage, or similar instrument,  if authorized by State Supplement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Voluntary conveyance. Voluntary conveyance of chattels will be  accepted only when the borrower can convey ownership free of other liens  and the borrower can be released from liability under the conditions set  forth in Sec. 1955.10(f)(2) of this subpart. Payment of other  lienholders' debts by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 in order to accept voluntary conveyance of chattels is not  authorized. Before a voluntary conveyance from a Farmer Program loan  borrower can be accepted, the borrower must be sent Exhibit A with  Attachments 1 and 2 of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Offer. The borrower's offer of voluntary conveyance will be made  on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1955-1. If  it is determined the conveyance offer can be accepted, the borrower will  execute a bill of sale itemizing each item of chattel property being  conveyed and will provide titles to vehicles or other equipment, where  applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acceptance of offer release from liability. Before accepting an  offer to convey chattels to FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354, the concurrence of the State Director must be obtained.  When chattel security is voluntarily conveyed to the Government and the  borrower and cosigner(s), if any, are to be released from liability, the  servicing official will stamp the note(s) ``Satisfied by Surrender of  Security and Borrower Released from Liability.'' When the Agency debt  less the market value and prior liens is $1 million or more (including  principal, interest and other charges), release of liability must be  approved by the Administrator or designee; otherwise, the State Director  must approve the release of liability. All cases requiring a release of  liability will be submitted in accordance with Exhibit A of Subpart B of  Part 1956 of this chapter (available in any FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 office). Form FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 1955-1 will be executed by the servicing  official showing acceptance by the Government, and the satisfied note(s)  and a copy of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  1955-1 will be furnished to the borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Release of lien(s). When an offer has been accepted as outlined  in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the servicing official will release  any liens of record which secured the satisfied indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rejection of offer. If it is determined an offer of voluntary  conveyance will not be accepted, the servicing official will indicate on  Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1955-1 that  the offer is rejected, execute the form, and furnish a copy to the  borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Attending sales. The servicing official will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Attend all sales described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section  unless an exception is authorized by the State Director because of  physical danger to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 employee or adverse publicity would be likely.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Attend public sales by prior lienholders when the market value  of the chattel property is significantly more than the amount of the  prior lien(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Appraising chattel property. Prior to the sale, the servicing  official will appraise chattel property using Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 440-21, ``Appraisal of Chattel  Property.'' If a qualified appraiser is not available to appraise  chattel property, the State Director may obtain an appraisal from a  qualified source outside FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 by contract in accordance with FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2024-A (available in any FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Abandonment of security interest. The State Director may  authorize abandonment of the Government's security interest when chattel  property, considering costs of moving or rehabilitation, has no market  value and obtaining title would not be in the best interest of the  Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Bidding at sale. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The servicing official is authorized to bid  at sales described in paragraph (a) of this section. Ordinarily, only  one bid will be made on items of chattel security unless the State  Director authorizes incremental bidding. Bids will be made only when no  other party bids or when it appears bidding will stop and the property  will be sold for less than the amount of the Government's authorized  bid. When the State Director determines attendance of an FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employee might pose physical  danger, a written bid may be submitted to the party holding the sale.  The bid(s) will be the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The market value of the item(s) less the estimated costs  involved in the acquisition, care, and sale of the item(s) of security;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The unpaid balance of the borrower's secured FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 debt plus prior liens, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Bids will not be made in the following situations unless  authorized by the State Director:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When chattel property under prior lien has a market value which  is not significantly more than the amount owed the prior lienholder. If  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 holds a junior  lien on several items of chattel property, advice should be obtained  from the State Director on bidding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After sufficient chattel property has been bid in by FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to satisfy the FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 debt; prior liens, and cost of  the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When the sale is being conducted by a lienholder junior to  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> At a private sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When the sale is being conducted under the terms of Form FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 455-3, ``Agreement for  Sale by Borrower (Chattels and/or Real Estate)''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Payment of costs. Costs to be paid by FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 in connection with acquisition of  chattel property will be paid as outlined in Sec. 1955.5(d) of this  subpart as recoverable costs.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Payment of other lienholders' debts in connection with  voluntary conveyance of chattels is not authorized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Reporting acquisition of chattel property. Acquisition of  chattel property will be reported by use of Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 1955-3 prepared and distributed in  accordance with the FMI.
