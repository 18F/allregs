The Board shall not have jurisdiction to pass on the validity of any portion of the Code of Federal Regulations which has been duly promulgated through notice and comment by the Department of Labor and shall observe the provisions thereof, where pertinent, in its decisions. The jurisdiction of the Board includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wage determinations issued under the Service Contract Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Substantial variance proceedings or arm's-length negotiations proceedings pursuant to section 4(c) of the Service Contract Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Debarment or other enforcement proceedings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Proceedings to determine substantial interest of debarred persons or firms;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Decisions of the Wage-Hour Administrator or authorized representative regarding recommendations of a Federal agency for adjustment or waiver of liquidated damages assessed under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other final actions of the Wage-Hour Administrator or authorized representative (e.g., additional classification actions and rulings with respect to application of the Act(s), or the regulations, or of wage determinations issued thereunder).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Other matters specifically referred to the Board by the Secretary of Labor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In considering the matters within the scope of its jurisdiction the Board

However, unless the petition for review cities alleged procedural irregularities in the proceeding below and not the merits of a case, the Board shall not consider a petition for review filed by any party against whom default judgment has been entered pursuant to the provisions of part 6 of this title.
