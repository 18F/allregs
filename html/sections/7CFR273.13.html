                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use of notice. Prior to any action to reduce or terminate a  household's benefits within the certification period, the State agency  shall, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, provide the  household timely and adequate advance notice before the adverse action  is taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The notice of adverse action shall be considered timely if the  advance notice period conforms to that period of time defined by the  State agency as an adequate notice period for its public assistance  caseload, provided that the period includes at least 10 days from the  date the notice is mailed to the date upon which the action becomes  effective. Also, if the adverse notice period ends on a weekend or  holiday, and a request for a fair hearing and continuation of benefits  is received the day after the weekend or holiday, the State agency shall  consider the request timely received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The notice of adverse action shall be considered adequate if it  explains in easily understandable language: The proposed action; the  reason for the proposed action; the household's right to request a fair  hearing; the telephone number of the food stamp office (toll-free number  or a number where collect calls will be accepted for households outside  the local calling area) and, if possible, the name of the person to  contact for additional information; the availability of continued  benefits; and the liability of the household for any overissuances  received while awaiting a fair hearing if the hearing official's  decision is adverse to the household. If there is an individual or  organization available that provides free legal representation, the  notice shall also advise the household of the availability of the  service. A notice of adverse action that combines the request for  verification of information received through an IEVS computer match  shall meet the requirements in Sec. 273.2(f)(9). A notice of adverse  action that combines the request for verification of information  received through a SAVE computer match shall meet the requirements in  Sec. 273.2(f)(10).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State agency may notify a household that its benefits will  be reduced or terminated, no later than the date the household receives,  or would have received, its allotment, if the following conditions are  met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The household reports the information which results in the  reduction or termination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The reported information is in writing and signed by the  household.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The State agency can determine the household's allotment or  ineligibility based solely on the information provided by the household  as required in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The household retains its right to a fair hearing as allowed in  Sec. 273.15.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The household retains its right to continued benefits if the  fair hearing is requested within the time period set by the State agency  in accordance with Sec. 273.13(a)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The State agency continues the household's previous benefit  level, if required, within five working days of the household's request  for a fair hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The State agency shall notify a household that its benefits will  be reduced if an EBT system-error has occurred during the redemption  process resulting in an out-of-balance settlement condition. This  notification shall be made no later than the date the action is  initiated against the household account. The State agency shall adjust   the benefit in accordance with Sec. 274.12 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemptions from notice. Individual notices of adverse action  shall not be provided when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, (e)(2), or  (e)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State agency determines, based on reliable information, that  all members of a household have died.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State agency determines, based on reliable information, that  the household has moved from the project area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The household has been receiving an increased allotment to  restore lost benefits, the restoration is complete, and the household  was previously notified in writing of when the increased allotment would  terminate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The household's allotment varies from month to month within the  certification period to take into account changes which were anticipated  at the time of certification, and the household was so notified at the  time of certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The household jointly applied for PA/GA and food stamp benefits  and has been receiving food stamp benefits pending the approval of the  PA/GA grant and was notified at the time of certification that food  stamp benefits would be reduced upon approval of the PA/GA grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A household member is disqualified for an intentional Program  violation in accordance with Sec. 273.16, or the benefits of the  remaining household members are reduced or terminated to reflect the  disqualification of that household member, except as provided in  Sec. 273.11(c)(3)(i). A notice of adverse action must be sent to a  currently participating household prior to the reduction or termination  of benefits if a household member is found through a disqualified  recipient match to be within the period of disqualification for an  intentional Program violation penalty determined in another State. In  the case of applicant households, State agencies shall follow the  procedures in Sec. 273.2(f)(11) for issuing notices to the disqualified  individual and the remaining household members. The notice requirements  for individuals or households affected by intentional Program violation  disqualifications are explained in Sec. 273.16.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The State agency has elected to assign a longer certification  period to a household certified on an expedited basis and for whom  verification was postponed, provided the household has received written  notice that the receipt of benefits beyond the month of application is  contingent on its providing the verification which was initially  postponed and that the State agency may act on the verified information  without further notice as provided in Sec. 273.2(i)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The State agency must change the household's benefits back to  the original benefit level as required in Sec. 273.12(c)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Converting a household from cash and/or food stamp coupon  repayment to benefit reduction as a result of failure to make agreed  upon repayment as discussed in Sec. 273.18.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The State agency is terminating the eligibility of a resident  of a drug or alcoholic treatment center or a group living arrangement if  the facility loses either its certification from the appropriate agency  or agencies of the State (as defined in Sec. 271.2) or has its status as  an authorized representative suspended due to FNS disqualifying it as a  retailer. However, residents of group living arrangements applying on  their own behalf are still eligible to participate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The household voluntarily requests, in writing or in the  presence of a caseworker, that its participation be terminated. If the  household does not provide a written request, the State agency shall  send the household a letter confirming the voluntary withdrawal. Written  confirmation does not entail the same rights as a notice of adverse  action except that the household may request a fair hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> The State agency determines, based on reliable information,  that the household will not be residing in the project area and,  therefore, will be unable to obtain its next allotment. The State agency  shall inform the household of its termination no later than its next  scheduled issuance date. While the State agency may inform the household  before its next issuance   date, the State agency shall not delay terminating the household's  participation in order to provide advance notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> The State agency initiates recoupment of a claim as specified  in Sec. 273.18(g)(4) against a household which has previously received a  notice of adverse action with respect to such claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Optional notice. The State agency may, at its option, send the  household an adequate notice as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this  section when the household's address is unknown and mail directed to it  has been returned by the post office indicating no known forwarding  address.
