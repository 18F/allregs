For nonvaccine biological products, an  applicant should not include in reports under this section the names and  addresses of individual patients; instead, the applicant should assign a  unique code for identification of the patient.

The names of patients, health care professionals,  hospitals, and geographical identifiers in adverse experience reports  are not releasable to the public under FDA's public information  regulations in part 20 of this chapter. For vaccine adverse experience  reports, these data will become part of the CDC Privacy Act System 09- 20-0136, ``Epidemiologic Studies and Surveillance of Disease Problems.''  Information identifying the person who received the vaccine or that  person's legal representative will not be made available to the public,  but may be available to the vaccinee or legal representative.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p>
