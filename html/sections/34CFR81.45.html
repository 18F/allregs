                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An authorized Departmental official collects a claim established  under this subpart by using the standards and procedures in 34 CFR part  30.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A claim established under this subpart may be collected--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 30 days after a recipient receives notice of a disallowance  decision if the recipient fails to file an acceptable application for  review under Sec. 81.37; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On the date of the final decision of the Department under Sec.  81.44 if the recipient obtains review of a disallowance decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department takes no collection action pending judicial  review of a final decision of the Department under section 458 of GEPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a recipient obtains review of a disallowance decision under  Sec. 81.38, the Department does not collect interest on the claim for  the period between the date of the disallowance decision and   the date of the final decision of the Department under Sec. 81.44.  (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1234(f)(1); 1234a(f)(1) and (2), (i), and (1))  [54 FR 19512, May 5, 1989. Redesignated and amended at 58 FR 43473, Aug.  16, 1993]</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix to Part 81--Illustrations of Proportionality</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ineligible beneficiaries. A State uses 15 percent of its grant  to meet the special educational needs of children who were migratory,  but who have not migrated for more than five years as a Federal program  statute requires for eligibility to participate in the program. Result:  Recovery of 15 percent of the grant--all program funds spent for the  benefit of those children. Although the services were authorized, the  children were not eligible to receive them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ineligible beneficiaries. A Federal program designed to meet the  special educational needs of gifted and talented children requires that  at least 80 percent of the children served in any project must be  identified as gifted or talented. A local educational agency (LEA)  conducts a project in which 76 students are identified as gifted or  talented and 24 are not. The project was designed and implemented to  meet the special educational needs of gifted and talented students.  Result: The LEA must return five percent of the project costs. The LEA  provided authorized services for a project in which the 76 target  students had to constitute at least 80 percent of the total. Thus, the  maximum number of non-target students permitted was 19. Project costs  relating to the remaining five students must be returned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ineligible beneficiaries. Same as the example in paragraph (2),  except that only 15 percent of the children were identified as gifted or  talented. On the basis of the low percentage of these children and other  evidence, the authorized Departmental official finds that the project as  a whole did not address their special educational needs and was outside  the purpose of the statute. Result: The LEA must return its entire  award. The difference between the required percentage of gifted and  talented children and the percentage actually enrolled is so substantial  that, if consistent with other evidence, the official may reasonably  conclude the entire grant was misused.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ineligible beneficiaries. Same as the example in paragraph (2),  except that 60 percent of the children were identified as gifted or  talented, and it is not clear whether the project was designed or  implemented to meet the special educational needs of these children.  Result: If it is determined that the project was designed and  implemented to serve their special educational needs, the LEA must  return 25 percent of the project costs. A project that included 60  target children would meet the requirement that 80 percent of the  children served be gifted and talented if it included no more than 15  other children. Thus, while the LEA provided authorized services, only  75 percent of the beneficiaries were authorized to participate in the  project (60 target children and 15 others). If the authorized  Departmental official, after examining all the relevant facts,  determines that the project was not designed and implemented to serve  the special educational needs of gifted or talented students, the LEA  must return its entire award because it did not provide services  authorized by the statute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Unauthorized activities. An LEA uses ten percent of its grant  under a Federal program that authorizes activities only to meet the  special educational needs of educationally deprived children to pay for  health services that are available to all children in the LEA. All the  children who use the Federally funded health services happen to be  educationally deprived, and thus eligible to receive program services.  Result: Recovery of ten percent of the grant--all program funds spent  for the health services. Although the children were eligible to receive  program services, the health services were unrelated to a special  educational need and, therefore, not authorized by law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Set-aside requirement. A State uses 22 percent of its grant for  one fiscal year under a Federal adult education program to provide  programs of equivalency to a certificate of graduation from a secondary  school. The adult education program statute restricts those programs to  no more than 20 percent of the State's grant. Result: Two percent of the  State's grant must be returned. Although all 22 percent of the funds  supported adult education, the State had no authority to spend more than  20 percent on secondary school equivalency programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Set-aside requirement. A State uses eight percent of its basic  State grant under a Federal vocational education program to pay for the  excess cost of vocational education services and activities for  handicapped individuals. The program statute requires a State to use ten  percent of its basic State grant for this purpose. Result: The State  must return two percent of its basic State grant, regardless of how it  was used. Because the State was required to spend that two percent on  services and activities for handicapped individuals and did not do so,  it diverted those funds from their intended purposes, and the Federal  interest was harmed to that extent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Excess cost requirement. An LEA uses funds reserved for the  disadvantaged under a Federal vocational education program to pay for  the cost of the same vocational education services it provides to non- disadvantaged individuals. The program statute requires that funds  reserved for the disadvantaged must be   used to pay only for the supplemental or additional costs of vocational  education services that are not provided to other individuals and that  are required for disadvantaged individuals to participate in vocational  education. Result: All the funds spent on the disadvantaged must be  returned. Although the funds were spent to serve the disadvantaged, the  funds were available to pay for only the supplemental or additional  costs of providing services to the disadvantaged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Maintenance-of-effort requirement. An LEA participates in a  Federal program in fiscal year 1988 that requires it to maintain its  expenditures from non-Federal sources for program purposes to receive  its full allotment. The program statute requires that non-Federal funds  expended in the first preceding fiscal year must be at least 90 percent  of non-Federal funds expended in the second preceding fiscal year and  provides for a reduction in grant amount proportional to the shortfall  in expenditures. No waiver of the requirement is authorized. In fiscal  year 1986 the LEA spent $100,000 from non-Federal sources for program  purposes; in fiscal year 1987, only $87,000. Result: The LEA must return  \1/30\ of its fiscal year 1988 grant--the amount of its grant that  equals the proportion of its shortfall ($3,000) to the required level of  expenditures ($90,000). If, instead, the statute made maintenance of  expenditures a clear condition of the LEA's eligibility to receive funds  and did not provide for a proportional reduction in the grant award, the  LEA would be required to return its entire grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Supplanting prohibition. An LEA uses funds under a Federal drug  education program to provide drug abuse prevention counseling to  students in the eighth grade. The LEA is required to provide that same  counseling under State law. Funds under the Federal program statute are  subject to a supplement-not-supplant requirement. Result: All the funds  used to provide the required counseling to the eighth-grade students  must be returned. The Federal funds did not increase the total amount of  spending for program purposes because the counseling would have been  provided with non-Federal funds if the Federal funds were not available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Matching requirement. A State receives an allotment of $90,000  for fiscal year 1988 under a Federal adult education program. It expends  its full allotment and $8,000 from its own resources for adult  education. Under the Federal statute, the Federal share of expenditures  for the State's program is 90 percent. Result: The State must return the  unmatched Federal funds, or $18,000. Expenditure of a $90,000 Federal  allotment required $10,000 in matching State expenditures, $2,000 more  than the State's actual expenditures. At a ratio of one State dollar for  every nine Federal dollars, $18,000 in Federal funds were unmatched.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Application requirements. In order to receive funds under a  Federal program that supports a wide range of activities designed to  improve the quality of elementary and secondary education, an LEA  submits an application to its State educational agency (SEA) for a  subgrant to carry out school-level basic skills development programs.  The LEA submits its application after conducting an assessment of the  needs of its students in consultation with parents, teachers, community  leaders, and interested members of the general public. The Federal  program statute requires the application and consultation processes. The  SEA reviews the LEA's application, determines that the proposed programs  are sound and the application is in compliance with Federal law, and  approves the application. After the LEA receives the subgrant, it  unilaterally decides to use 20 percent of the funds for gifted and  talented elementary school students--an authorized activity under the  Federal statute. However, the LEA does not consult with interested  parties and does not amend its application. Result: 20 percent of the  LEA's subgrant must be returned. The LEA had no legal authority to use  Federal funds for programs or activities other than those described in  its approved application, and its actions with respect to 20 percent of  the subgrant not only impaired the integrity of the application process,  but caused significant harm to other Federal interests associated with  the program as follows: the required planning process was circumvented  because the LEA did not consult with the specified local interests;  program accountability was impaired because neither the SEA nor the  various local interests that were to be consulted had an opportunity to  review and comment on the merits of the gifted and talented program  activities, and the LEA never had to justify those activities to them;  and fiscal accountability was impaired because the SEA and those various  local interests were, in effect, misled by the LEA's unamended  application regarding the expenditure of Federal funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Harmless violation. Under a Federal program, a grantee is  required to establish a 15-member advisory council of affected teachers,  school administrators, parents, and students to assist in program  design, monitoring, and evaluation. Although the law requires at least  three student members of the council, a grantee's council contains only  two. The project is carried out, and no damage to the project  attributable to the lack of a third student member can be identified.  Result: No financial recovery is required, although the grantee must  take other appropriate steps to come into compliance with the law. The  grantee's violation has not   measurably harmed a Federal interest associated with the program.
