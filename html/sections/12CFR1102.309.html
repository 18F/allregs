                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Any submitter of written information to the ASC who  desires that some or all of his or her submission be afforded  confidential treatment under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) (i.e., trade secrets and  commercial or financial information obtained from a person and  privileged or confidential) shall file a request for confidential  treatment with the Executive Director of the ASC at the time the written  information is submitted to the ASC or within ten business days  thereafter. Nothing in this section limits the authority of the ASC and  its staff to make determinations regarding access to documents under  this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of request. A request for confidential treatment shall be  submitted in a separate letter or memorandum conspicuously entitled,  ``Request for Confidential Treatment.'' Each request shall state in  reasonable detail the facts and arguments supporting the request and its  legal justification. If the submitter had been required by the ASC to  provide the particular information, conclusory statements that the  information would be useful to competitors or would impair sales or  similar statements generally will not be considered sufficient to  justify confidential treatment. When the submitter had voluntarily  provided the particular information to the ASC, the submitter must  specifically identify the documents or information which are of a kind  the submitter would not customarily make available to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Designation and separation of confidential material. Submitters  shall clearly designate all information considered confidential and  shall clearly separate such information from other non-confidential  information, whenever possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> ASC action on request. A request for confidential treatment of  information will be considered only in connection with a request for  access to the information under FOIA as implemented   by this subpart. Upon the receipt of a request for access, the Executive  Director or his or her designee (``ASC Officer'') as soon as possible  shall provide the submitter with a written notice describing the request  and shall provide the submitter with a reasonable opportunity, no longer  than ten business days, to submit written objections to disclosure of  the information. Notice may be given orally, and such notice shall be  promptly confirmed in writing. The ASC Officer may provide a submitter  with a notice if the submitter did not request confidential treatment of  the requested information. If the ASC required the submitter to provide  the requested information, the ASC Officer would need substantial reason  to believe that disclosure of the requested information would result in  substantial competitive harm to the submitter. If the submitter provided  the information voluntarily to the ASC, the ASC officer would need to  believe that the information is of a kind the submitter would not  customarily make available to the public. The ASC Officer similarly  shall notify the person seeking disclosure of the information under FOIA  of the existence of a request for confidential treatment. These notice  requirements need not be followed if the ASC Officer determines under  this subpart that the information should not be disclosed; the  information has been published or has been officially made available to  the public; disclosure of the information is required by law (other than  FOIA); or the submitter's request for confidential treatment appears  obviously frivolous, in such instance the submitter shall be given  written notice of the determination to disclose the information at least  five business days prior to release. The ASC Officer shall carefully  consider the issues involved, and if disclosure of the requested  information is warranted, a written notice, containing a brief  description of why the submitter's objections were not sustained, must  be forwarded to the submitter within ten business days. The time for  response may be extended up to ten additional business days, as provided  in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), or for other periods by agreement between the  requester and the ASC Officer. This notice shall be provided to the  submitter at least five business days prior to release of the requested  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice of lawsuit. The ASC Officer shall notify a submitter of  any filing of any suit against the ASC pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 to  compel disclosure of documents or information covered by the submitter's  request for confidential treatment within ten business days of service  of the suit. The ASC Officer also shall notify the requester of the  documents or information of any suit filed by the submitter against the  ASC to enjoin their disclosure within ten business days of service of  the suit.
