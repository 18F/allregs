                            <p class="depth0">The transportation of hazardous materials is governed by the hazardous materials regulations (49 CFR parts 170-180) issued by the Department of Transportation. Except as otherwise provided below, an agency official, prior to the transportation of hazardous materials, shall certify on the shipping document, based on his/her own examination, that the materials are properly classified, described, packaged, marked, and labeled and are in proper condition for transportation in accordance with the hazardous materials regulations. The shipper shall provide such certification in duplicate and give one copy to the originating carrier and retain the other for no less than 1 year. Hazardous materials sold by the Department of Defense (DOD) in packings not marked under the hazardous materials regulations may be shipped from DOD installations, provided DOD certifies in writing on a certificate or equivalency (COE) that the packing meets or exceeds requirements of the hazardous materials regulations.</p>
