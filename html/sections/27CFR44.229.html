                            <p class="depth0">In case of inability to furnish the prescribed evidence of landing, application for relief shall be promptly made by the claimant to the appropriate TTB officer. Such application shall set forth the facts connected with the alleged exportation, and indicate the date of shipment, the kind, quantity, and value of tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes shipped, the name of the consignee, the name of the vessel, the port or place of destination to which the shipment was made, and the date and amount of the bond covering such shipment. The application shall also state in what particular the provisions of this subpart, respecting the proofs of landing, have not been complied with, and the cause of failure to furnish such proofs; that such failure was not occasioned by any lack of diligence on the part of the claimant, or that of his agents; and that he is unable to furnish any other or better evidence than that furnished with his application. Each such application shall be supported by the best collateral evidence the claimant may be able to submit. The evidence may consist of the original or verified copies of letters from the consignee advising the claimant of the arrival or sale of the tobacco products, and cigarette papers and tubes, with such other statements respecting the failure to furnish the prescribed evidence of landing as may be obtained from the consignee or other persons having knowledge thereof. Such letters and other documents in a foreign language shall be accompanied by accurate translations thereof in English, and, when the letters fail to identify sufficiently the tobacco products, and cigarette papers and tubes, the original sales account must be produced.
