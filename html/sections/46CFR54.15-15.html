                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An approved safety valve set to relieve at a pressure not  exceeding the ``maximum allowable working pressure'' of the shell shall  be fitted to all unfired steam boilers and evaporators except for  evaporators of the atmospheric type designed for vapor discharge direct  to a distiller with no shutoff valve in the discharge line. The  distiller connected to atmospheric evaporators shall be fitted with a  vent to prevent a buildup in pressure. In no case shall the vent be less  than 1\1/2\ inches in diameter. Evaporators operating between  atmospheric pressure and 15 p.s.i.g., may use a rupture disc as an  alternative to the safety valve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Safety valves for use on pressure vessels in which steam or  pressure is generated shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 54.15- 10. Rupture discs used in lieu of these safety valves, as provided for  in paragraph (a) of this section, shall comply with the requirements of  Sec. 54.15-13.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> (1) or (2) of this section as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the set pressure of the evaporator shell safety valve is  58 percent or less than the setting of the safety valve in the steam  supply: W = 51.45AP</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the set pressure of the evaporator shell safety valve  exceeds 58 percent of the setting of the safety valve on the steam  supply:  W = 105.3A[radic] P1(P-P1)  where:  W = The required orifice capacity, in pounds per hour. A = Cross-sectional area of rounded entrance orifice, in square inches.</p><p class="depth3">The orifice shall be installed near the steam inlet or the</p><p class="depth3">coils or tubes and where no orifice is employed the area used</p><p class="depth3">in the formula shall be that of the inlet connection or</p><p class="depth3">manifold. P = Set pressure of steam supply safety valve, in pounds per square</p><p class="depth3">inch, absolute. P1 = Set pressure of evaporator shell safety valve, in pounds</p><p class="depth3">per square inch, absolute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The relieving capacity of safety valves on unfired steam boilers  shall not be less than the maximum generating capacity of the unfired  steam boiler as certified by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> On new installations and where the orifice size of an existing  unfired steam boiler or evaporator is increased, an accumulation test  shall be made by closing all steam outlet connections except the safety  valves for a period of five minutes. When conducting the accumulation  test, the water shall be at the normal operating level and the steam  pressure shall be at the normal operating pressure, and while under this  test the pressure shall not rise more than 6 percent above the safety  valve setting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A heat exchanger with liquid in the shell and the heating medium  in the tubes or coils, shall be fitted with a liquid relief valve  meeting the requirement of Sec. 54.15-5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A heat exchanger with steam in the shell and liquid in the  tubes or coils at a pressure exceeding that in the shell, shall have a  liquid relief valve fitted to protect the shell against excess pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The discharge capacity of such relief valves shall be calculated  on the basis of the discharge from one tube using the difference in  pressures between that in the shell and that in the tubes and shall be  not less than that determined by the following formula:  Q = 29.81KD 2[radic] P1-P2  where:  Q = Required relief valve discharge capacity, in gallons per minute,</p><p class="depth3">based on relief valve set pressure. P1 = Pressure in the tube or coils, in pounds per square</p><p class="depth3">inch. P2 = Set pressure of the shell relief valve, in pounds per</p><p class="depth3">square inch. D = Internal diameter of the largest tube or coil, in inches. K = Coefficient of discharge = 0.62.
