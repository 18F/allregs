The quantity of all finishes used for finishing operations must be  weighed or have a predetermined weight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (3) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine the density of each applied finish in pounds per  gallon in accordance with Sec. 63.5395. The finish density will be used  to convert applied finish volumes from gallons into mass units of  pounds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (v) of this  section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Locate the flow sensor and other necessary equipment such as  straightening vanes in or as close to a position that provides a  representative flow.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use a flow sensor with a minimum tolerance of 2 percent of the  flow rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reduce swirling flow or abnormal velocity distributions due to  upstream and downstream disturbances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Conduct a flow sensor calibration check at least semiannually.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> At least monthly, inspect all components for integrity, all  electrical connections for continuity, and all mechanical connections  for leakage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Volume measurements of each applied finish can be obtained with  a calibrated volumetric container with an accuracy of at least 5 percent  of the amount measured.</p>
