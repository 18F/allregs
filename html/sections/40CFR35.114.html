                            <p class="depth0">The following provisions govern amendments and other changes to  grant work plans and budgets after the work plan is negotiated and a  grant awarded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Changes requiring prior approval. Recipients may make  significant changes in work plan commitments only after obtaining the  Regional Administrator's prior written approval. EPA, in consultation  with the recipient, will document these revisions including budgeted  amounts associated with the revisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Changes requiring approval. Recipients must request, in writing,  grant amendments for changes requiring increases in environmental  program grant amounts and extensions of the funding period. Recipients  may begin implementing a change before the amendment has been approved  by EPA, but do so at their own risk. If EPA approves the change, EPA  will issue a grant amendment. EPA will notify the recipient in writing  if the change is disapproved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Changes not requiring approval. Other than those situations  described   in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, recipients do not need to  obtain approval for changes, including changes in grant work plans,  budgets, or other components of grant agreements, unless the Regional  Administrator determines approval requirements should be imposed on a  specific recipient for a specified period of time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> OMB cost principles. The Regional Administrator may waive in  writing approval requirements for specific recipients and costs  contained in OMB cost principles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Changes in consolidated grants. Recipients of consolidated  grants under Sec. 35.109 may not transfer funds among environmental  programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subgrants. Subgrantees must request required approvals in  writing from the recipient and the recipient shall approve or disapprove  the request in writing. A recipient will not approve any work plan or  budget revision which is inconsistent with the purpose or terms and  conditions of the federal grant to the recipient. If the revision  requested by the subgrantee would result in a significant change to the  recipient's approved grant which requires EPA approval, the recipient  will obtain EPA's approval before approving the subgrantee's request.
