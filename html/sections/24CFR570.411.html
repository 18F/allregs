                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Grants under this section will be awarded to  institutions of higher education or to States and local governments  applying jointly with institutions of higher education. Institutions of  higher education must demonstrate the capacity to carry out activities  under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. For  ease of reference, this program may be called the Joint CD Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth2">Demonstrated capacity to carry out eligible activities under title I  means recent satisfactory activity by the institution of higher  education's staff designated to work on the program, including  subcontractors and consultants firmly committed to work on the proposed  activities, in title I programs or similar programs without the need for  oversight by a State or unit of general local government.</p><p class="depth2">Institution of higher education means a college or university  granting 4-year degrees and accredited by a national or regional  accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligible applicants. Institutions of higher education or States  and units of general local government jointly with institutions of  higher education may apply. Institutions of higher education with  demonstrated capacity to carry out eligible activities under title I may  apply on their own, without the joint participation of a State or unit  of general local government. States or unit of general local governments  must file jointly with an institution of higher education. For these  approved joint applications, the grant will be made to the State or unit  of general local government and the institution of higher education  jointly. If an eligible applicant is an institution of higher education,  it will not be funded more than once for the same kinds of activities.  These grantees may not receive funding under a subsequent NOFA if it has  the same program objectives as the one   under which the grantee previously received funding. However, a State or  unit of general local government is eligible to apply if it files  jointly with a different institution of higher education in each NOFA  cycle. HUD may further limit the type of eligible applicant to be  funded. Any such limitations will be contained in the Notice of Funding  Availability described below in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Role of participants in joint applications. An institution of  higher education and a State or unit of general local government may  carry out eligible activities approved in joint applications. Where  there are joint applicants, the grant will be made to both and both will  be responsible for oversight, compliance, and performance. The  application will have to clearly delineate the role of each applicant in  the joint application. Any funding sanctions or other remedial actions  by HUD for noncompliance or nonperformance, whether by the State or unit  of general local government or by the institution of higher education,  shall be taken against both grantees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Eligible activities. Activities that may be funded under this  section are those eligible under 24 CFR part 570--Community Development  Block Grants, subpart C--Eligible Activities. These activities may be  designed to assist residents of colonias, as defined in section 916(d)  of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 5306  note), to improve living conditions and standards within colonias. HUD  may limit the activities to be funded. Any such limitations will be  contained in the Notice of Funding Availability described in paragraph  (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Applications. Applications will only be accepted from eligible  applicants in response to a publication of a Notice of Funding  Availability (NOFA) published by HUD in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Local approval. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where an institution of higher education is  the applicant, each unit of general local government that is an  entitlement jurisdiction where an activity is to take place must approve  the activity and certify that the activity is consistent with its  Consolidated Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where a State is the joint applicant and it proposes to carry  out an activity within the jurisdiction of one or more units of general  local government, then each such unit must approve the activity and  state that the activity is consistent with its Consolidated Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> These approvals and findings must accompany each application and  may take the form of a letter by the chief executive officer of each  unit of general local government affected or a resolution of the  legislative body of each such unit of general local government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> NOFA contents. The NOFA will describe any special objectives  sought to be achieved by the funding to be provided, including any  limitations on the type of activities to be funded to achieve the  objectives, any limitations on the type of eligible applicants, and  points to be awarded to each of the selection criteria and any special  factors to be evaluated in assigning points under the selection criteria  to achieve the stated objectives. The NOFA will also state the deadline  for the submission of applications, the total funding available for the  competition, the period of performance and the maximum and minimum  amount of individual grants. The NOFA will also state which of the  various possible levels of competition HUD will use: national and/or  regional or entitlement areas vs. non-entitlement areas; and States or  units of general local government vs. institutions of higher education  vs. institutions of higher education with a demonstrated capacity. The  NOFA will include further information and instructions for the  submission of acceptable applications to HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Selection criteria. Each application submitted under this  section will be evaluated by HUD using the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The extent to which the applicant addresses the objectives  published in the NOFA and demonstrates how the proposed activities will  have a substantial impact in achieving the objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The extent of the needs to be addressed by the proposed  activities, particularly with respect to benefiting low- and moderate- income persons and residents of colonias, where applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The feasibility of the proposed activities, i.e., their  technical and financial feasibility, for achieving the stated  objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The capability of the applicant to carry out satisfactorily the  proposed activities in a timely fashion, including satisfactory  performance in carrying out any previous HUD-assisted projects or  activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The extent of commitment to fair housing and equal opportunity,  as indicated by such factors as previous HUD monitoring/compliance  activity, actions to promote minority- and women-owned business  enterprise, affirmatively furthering fair housing issues, and  nondiscriminatory delivery of services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Selection discretion. HUD retains the right to exercise  discretion in selecting projects in a manner that would best serve the  program objectives, with consideration given to the needs of States and  units of general local government and institutions of higher education,  types of activities proposed, an equitable geographical distribution,  and program balance. The NOFA will state whether HUD will use this  discretion in any specific competition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Certifications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certifications, including those indicating  that applicants have adhered to all civil rights requirements under  subpart K of this part and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,  required to be submitted by applicants shall be as prescribed in the  NOFA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the absence of independent evidence which tends to challenge  in a substantial manner the certifications made by the applicant, the  required certifications will be accepted by HUD. However, if independent  evidence is available, HUD may require further information or assurances  to be submitted in order to determine whether the applicant's  certifications are satisfactory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Consolidated plan. An applicant that proposes any housing  activities as part of its application will be required to submit a  certification that these activities are consistent with the Consolidated  Plan of the jurisdiction to be served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Citizen participation. The citizen participation requirements of  Sec. Sec.  570.301, 570.431, 570.485(c) and 570.486(a) are modified to  require the following: The applicant must certify that citizens likely  to be affected by the project regardless of race, color, creed, sex,  national origin, familial status, or handicap, particularly low- and  moderate-income persons, have been provided an opportunity to comment on  the proposal or application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Environmental and Intergovernmental Review. The requirements for  Intergovernmental Reviews do not apply to these awards. When required,  an environmental review in accordance with 24 CFR part 58 must be  carried out by the State or unit of general local government when it is  the applicant. HUD will conduct any required environmental review when  an institution of higher education is the applicant.
