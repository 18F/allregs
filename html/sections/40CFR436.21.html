This information is available in ``Weather Bureau Technical Paper No. 40,'' May 1961 and ``NOAA Atlas 2,'' 1973 for the 11 Western States, and may be obtained from the National Climatic Center of the Environmental Data Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The term ``mine'' shall mean an area of land, surface or underground, actively mined for the production of crushed and broken stone from natural deposits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The term ``process generated waste water'' shall mean any waste water used in the slurry transport of mined material, air emissions control, or processing exclusive of mining.
