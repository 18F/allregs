                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the term ``cultured pearl,'' ``cultivated pearl,'' or any other word, term, or phrase of like meaning to describe, identify, or refer to any imitation pearl.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the term ``seed pearl'' or any word, term, or phrase of like meaning to describe, identify, or refer to a cultured or an imitation pearl, without using the appropriate qualifying term ``cultured'' (e.g., ``cultured seed pearl'') or ``simulated,'' ``artificial,'' or ``imitation'' (e.g., ``imitation seed pearl'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the term ``Oriental pearl'' or any word, term, or phrase of like meaning to describe, identify, or refer to any industry product other than a pearl taken from a salt water mollusk and of the distinctive appearance and type of pearls obtained from mollusks inhabiting the Persian Gulf and recognized in the jewelry trade as Oriental pearls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the word ``Oriental'' to describe, identify, or refer to any cultured or imitation pearl.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the word ``natura,'' ``natural,'' ``nature's,'' or any word, term, or phrase of like meaning to describe, identify, or refer to a cultured or imitation pearl. It is unfair or deceptive to use the term ``organic'' to describe, identify, or refer to an imitation pearl, unless the term is qualified in such a way as to make clear that the product is not a natural or cultured pearl.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the term ``kultured,'' ``semi-cultured pearl,'' ``cultured-like,'' ``part-cultured,'' ``pre-mature cultured pearl,'' or any word, term, or phrase of like meaning to describe, identify, or refer to an imitation pearl.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the term ``South Sea pearl'' unless it describes, identifies, or refers to a pearl that is taken from a salt water mollusk of the Pacific Ocean South Sea Islands, Australia, or Southeast Asia. It is unfair or deceptive to use the term ``South Sea cultured pearl'' unless it describes, identifies, or refers to a cultured pearl formed in a salt water mollusk of the Pacific Ocean South Sea Islands, Australia, or Southeast Asia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the term ``Biwa cultured pearl'' unless it describes, identifies, or refers to cultured pearls grown in fresh water mollusks in the lakes and rivers of Japan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the word ``real,'' ``genuine,'' ``precious,'' or any word, term, or phrase of like meaning to describe, identify, or refer to any imitation pearl.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the word ``gem'' to describe, identify, or refer to a pearl or cultured pearl that does not possess the beauty, symmetry, rarity, and value necessary for qualification as a gem.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (j): Use of the word ``gem'' with respect to cultured pearls should be avoided since few cultured pearls possess the necessary qualifications to properly be termed ``gems.'' Imitation pearls should not be described as ``gems.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the word ``synthetic'' or similar terms to describe cultured or imitation pearls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the terms ``Japanese Pearls,'' ``Chinese

Pearls,'' ``Mallorca Pearls,'' or any regional designation to describe, identify, or refer to any cultured or imitation pearl, unless the term is immediately preceded, with equal conspicuousness, by the word ``cultured,'' ``artificial,'' ``imitation,'' or ``simulated,'' or by some other word or phrase of like meaning, so as to indicate definitely and clearly that the product is a cultured or imitation pearl.</p>
