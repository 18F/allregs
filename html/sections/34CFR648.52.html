                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For academic year 1998-1999, the amount of the institutional payment received by an institution of higher education for each student awarded a fellowship at the institution is $10,222. Thereafter, the Secretary adjusts the amount of the institutional payment annually in accordance with inflation as determined by the United States Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index for the previous calendar year. The Secretary announces the amount of the institutional payment in a notice published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The institutional allowance paid under paragraph (a) of this section is reduced by the amount the institution charges and collects from a fellowship recipient for tuition and other expenses as part of the recipient's instructional program.
