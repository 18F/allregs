If our  approval is required, we have 30 days from receipt of the executed  sublease, proof of required consents, and required documentation to  approve or disapprove the sublease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If we do not send a determination within 30 days from receipt of  required documents, the sublease is deemed approved to the extent  consistent with Federal law. Unless the lease provides otherwise,  provisions of the sublease that are inconsistent with Federal law will  be severed and unenforceable; all other provisions of the sublease will  remain in force.</p>
