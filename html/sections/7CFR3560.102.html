                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Borrowers hold final responsibility for housing project  management and must ensure that operations comply with the terms of all  loan or grant documents, Agency requirements and applicable local, state  and Federal laws and ordinances. Project operations shall be conducted  to meet the actual needs and necessary expenses of the property or for  any other purpose authorized under Agency regulations. Any party not  meeting these responsibilities may be subject to penalties. It is  expected that only typical and reasonable expenses be incurred for the  services rendered. Consequently, methods to inflate, duplicate, obscure,  or failure to disclose the true nature and cost of work performed for  the services rendered will cause the Agency to deny budget requests for  the services or issue a demand for recovery and reimbursement for  unauthorized actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Management plan. Borrowers must develop and maintain a  management plan for each housing project covered by their loan or grant.  The management plan must establish the systems and procedures necessary  to ensure that housing project operations comply with Agency  requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At a minimum, management plans must address the following items:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Maintenance systems, including procedures for routine  maintenance, capital item repair and replacement, and effective energy  conservation practices;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Personnel policies, job descriptions, staffing plans, training  procedures for on-site staff. The Borrower will include specific duties  and responsibilities of each property manager, site manager and  caretaker;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Front-line management functions to be performed by off-site  staff;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Plans and procedures for providing supplemental services  including laundry, vending, and security;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Plans for accounting, record keeping and meeting Agency  reporting requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Procurement procedures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Rent and occupancy charge collection procedures, and  procedures for requesting and implementing changes in rents, utility  allowances, or occupancy charges;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Plans and procedures for marketing rental units and  maintaining compliance with the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan  in accordance with Sec. 3560.104;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Unit leases and leasing policies and procedures, including  procedures for maintaining and purging waiting lists, determining  applicant eligibility, certifying and recertifying income, tenant  selection, and occupancy policies such as security deposit amounts,  occupancy rules, termination of leases or occupancy agreements and  eviction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Plans for allowing tenant participation in property operations  and for fostering tenant relationships with management;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Procedures for applicant and tenant appeals; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Describe how management will make known to tenants and  applicants that management will provide reasonable accommodations under  the Fair Housing Act, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and  regulations implemented thereunder at the borrower's expense unless to  do so would cause an undue financial or administrative burden, how such  requests are to be made, and who within management will have the  authority to approve or disapprove a request for an accommodation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loan or grant applicants must submit a management plan before  the Agency will give final approval to the   loan or grant application. The plan must address the required items  identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in sufficient detail to  enable the Agency to monitor housing project performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Management plan effective period. A management plan remains in  effect as long as it accurately reflects housing project operations and  the housing project is in compliance with the Agency requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Borrowers must submit an updated management plan to the Agency  if operations change or are no longer consistent with the management  plan on file with the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When there are no changes in operations, borrowers must submit a  certification to the Agency every 3 years stating that operations are  consistent with the management plan and the plan is adequate to assure  compliance with the loan and grant documents and Agency requirements or  applicable local, state and Federal laws.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Agency determines that operations are in compliance with  Agency requirements, loan or grant agreements, or applicable local,  state, and Federal laws, but are not consistent with the management  plan, the Agency will require the borrower to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Revise the management plan to accurately reflect housing  operations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Take actions to ensure the management plan is followed; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Advise the Agency in writing of the action taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a housing project is being transferred from one borrower to  another, the transferee must submit a management plan that addresses the  required items identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in  sufficient detail to enable the Agency to give final approval of the  transfer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Housing projects with compliance violations. Upon receiving  notice of compliance violations in accordance with Sec. 3560.354,  borrowers must submit to the Agency:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Revisions to the management plan establishing the changes in  housing operations that will be made to restore compliance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the borrower determines the compliance violations were due to  a failure to follow the management plan, the borrower must certify to  the Agency that the management plan is adequate to assure compliance  with the applicable requirements of this part and submit a written  description of the actions they will take to ensure the management plan  is followed; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Agency discovers continued discrepancies between a  management plan and housing project operations or compliance violations,  the Agency may require the borrower to install a different management  agent acceptable to the Agency as described in paragraph (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Acceptable management agents. Borrowers must obtain Agency  approval of the agent proposed to manage a housing project prior to  entering into any formal agreement with the agent and prior to allowing  the agent to assume responsibility for housing project operations.  Borrowers that plan to self-manage a housing project also must receive  Agency approval before assuming responsibility for housing operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Borrowers must submit a written request for Agency approval of  the proposed management agent at least 45 days prior to the date the  agent is to assume responsibility for operations. This request must  include a profile of the proposed management agent that provides  sufficient information to allow the Agency to evaluate whether the agent  is acceptable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Agency will deny approval of any proposed management agent  that cannot provide evidence of at least two years of experience and  satisfactory performance in directing and overseeing the management of  similar federally-assisted MFH.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Agency may issue approval of a management agent that does  not meet the requirements of Sec. 3560.102(e)(2) if the management  agent can provide evidence that indicates the ability to successfully  manage a MFH project in accordance with Agency requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a borrower enters into an agreement with a management agent  or begins to self-manage prior to receiving Agency approval, the Agency  will place the borrower in non-monetary default status and will require  the borrower to immediately terminate the contract with the management  agent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Self-management. Borrowers may self-manage a housing project but  must receive Agency approval before assuming responsibility for housing  operations. Borrowers that plan to self-manage must meet all  requirements of Sec. 3560.102, except for paragraph (h) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Identity-of-interest disclosure. Borrowers and management agents  must disclose to the Agency all identity-of-interest relationships which  they have with firms and must receive Agency approval to use such firms  prior to entering into any contractual relationships with such entities  that involve Agency funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This disclosure must include any identity-of-interest  relationships between:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The borrower and the management agent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The borrower or management agent and the providers of supplies  and services to the housing project; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The borrower or the management agent and employees of any of  the above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure to disclose such relationships may subject the borrower,  the management agent, and the other firms or employees found to have an  identity of interest relationship to suspension, debarment, or other  remedies available to the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After disclosure of an identity-of-interest relationship:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The borrower, management agent, and supplier of goods and  services must provide documentation proving that use of identity-of- interest firms is in the best interest of the housing project;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any supplier of goods and services must certify in writing to  the Agency that the individual or organization has a viable, on-going  trade or business qualified and licensed, if appropriate, to do the work  for which a contract is being proposed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The borrower, management agent, and supplier of goods and  services must agree, in writing, that all records related to the housing  project will be made available to the Agency, Office of the Inspector  General (OIG), General Accountability Office (GAO), or a representative  of the Agency, upon request; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Agency will deny the use of an identity-of-interest firm  when the Agency determines such use is not in the best interest of the  Federal Government or the tenants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Management agreement. Borrowers contracting with a management  agent must execute a management agreement that establishes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The management agent's responsibility to comply with Agency  requirements and local, state, and Federal laws;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the management fee is payable out of the housing project's  general operating account consistent with the requirements of paragraph  (i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Agency's authority to terminate the agreement for failure to  operate the housing project in accordance with Agency requirements or  local, state, or Federal laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Management fees. Management fees will be an allowable expense to  be paid from the housing project's general operating account only if the  fee is approved by the Agency as a reasonable cost to the housing  project and documented on the management certification. Management fees  must be developed in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The management fee may compensate the management entity only for  the specifically identified bundle of services to be provided to the  housing project. Costs and services to be paid as part of the bundle of  services include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Supervision by the management agent and its staff (time,  knowledge, and expertise) of overall operations and capital improvements  of the site.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Hiring, supervision, and termination of on-site staff.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> General maintenance of project books and records (general  ledger, accounts payable and receivable, payroll, etc.).

Management  entities may be eligible to receive the full base per occupied unit fee  for any month or part of a month during which the unit is occupied.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Periodically, the Agency will develop a range of base per  occupied unit fees that will be paid in each state. The Agency will  develop the fees based on a review of housing industry data. The final  base for occupied unit fees for each state will be made available to all  borrowers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Periodically, the Agency will develop the amount and  qualifications to receive add-on fees. The final set of qualifications  will be made available to all borrowers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allowable Administrative Expenses. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identifying the Type of  Administrative Expense. Management Plans and Agreements must describe if  administrative expenses are to be paid from the management fee or paid  for as a project cost.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A management plan is required for all projects. The management  plan should describe administrative expenses paid from management agent  fees or project operations. The management plan should provide job  descriptions for the site manager, the management agent and other  personnel. It is important that these documents accurately reflect the  duties being performed by the various personnel. The management plan  must meet the standards set out in this rule.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A task list should be used to identify which services are  included in the management fee, which services are included in project  operations, and which are pro-rated along with the methodology used to  pro-rating of expenses between management agent fees and project  operations. Some property responsibilities are completed at the property  and some offsite. Agent responsibilities may be performed at the  property, the management office, or at some other location.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Disputes may arise as to who performs certain services. The  management plan and job descriptions should normally provide sufficient  clarity to avoid or resolve any such disputes; however, sometimes  clarifications and supporting materials may be required to resolve  disputes. The decision must be made based on the most complete  evaluation of the facts presented.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Allowable Administrative Expenses. Payroll related  administrative expenses are allowable expenses. Postage expense to mail  out rental applications, third-party (asset income and adjustments to  income) verifications, application processing correspondence (acceptance  or denial letters), mailing project invoice payments, required  correspondence, and report submittals to various regulatory authorities  for the managed property are allowable project expenses no matter what  location or point of origin the mail is generated. Photocopying or  printing expense related to actual production of project brochures,  marketing pieces, forms, reports, notices, and newsletters are allowable  project expenses no matter what location or point of origin the work is  performed including outsourcing the work to a professional printer.  Correspondence or reports required for record retention or project  compliance are allowable project expenses. The cost or expense of  equipment and any related equipment service contract is a management  agent direct expense, unless the machine becomes the property of the  project after purchase.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Determining if Expenses are Reasonable. Generally, expenses  charged to project operations, whether for management agent services or  other expenses, must be reasonable, typical, necessary and show a clear  benefit to the residents of the property. Services and expenses charged  to the property must show value added and be for authorized purposes. If  such value is not apparent, the service or expense should be examined.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Administrative expenses for project operations exceeding 23  percent, or those typical for the area, of gross potential basic rents  and revenues (i.e., referred to as gross potential rents in industry  publications) highlight a need for closer review for unnecessary  expenditures. Budget approval is required and project resources may not  always permit an otherwise allowable expense to be incurred if it is not  fiscally prudent in the market.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Excessive administrative expenses can result in inadequate funds  to meet other essential project needs, including expenditures for repair  and maintenance needed to keep the project in sound physical condition.  Actions that are improper or not fiscally prudent may warrant budget  disapproval and/or a demand for recovery action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unallowable Administrative Expenses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Certain expenses are not allowable such as legal fees,  association dues, bonuses or monetary performance awards, parties,  computer hardware and some software, and telephone purchases.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It is inappropriate to charge for legal services to represent  any interest other than the borrower's interest (i.e., representing a  general partner or limited partner to defend their individual owner  interest is not allowable). Where there is no finding of a borrower's  fault, commercially reasonable legal expenses and costs for defending or  settling lawsuits (without admission of liability) are allowable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Charging for payment of penalties, including opposition legal  fees resulting from an award finding improper actions on the part of the  owner or management agent is generally an inappropriate project expense.  The party responsible generally pays such expenses for violating the  standards or by their insurance carriers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Association dues to be paid by the project should only be  related to training for site managers or management agents. To the  extent that association dues can document training for site managers or  management agents related to project activities by actual cost or pro- ration, a reasonable expense may be billed to the project.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> It is inappropriate for the project to pay for bonuses or  monetary performance awards to site managers or management agents that  are not clearly provided for by the site manager salary contract.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Billing the project for parties that are large or unreasonable,  such as renting expensive party halls or hotel rooms and payment for  alcoholic beverages or gifts to management agent staff are also  inappropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> It is inappropriate to bill the project for computer hardware,  some software, and internal connections that are beyond the scope and  size reasonably needed for the services supplied (i.e., purchasing  equipment or software for use by a site manager that is clearly beyond  that needed to support project operations). Note that computer learning  center activities benefiting tenants are not covered in this  prohibition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> It is inappropriate to bill the project for practices that  are inefficient such as routine use of collect calls from a site manager  to a management agent office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Management certification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As a condition of approval of the  management agent and the management fee, the borrower and the management  agents must execute an Agency-approved certification establishing an  allowable management fee to be paid out of the housing project's general  operating account and certifying that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The borrower and management agent agree to operate the housing  project in accordance with the management plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The borrower and the management agent will comply with Agency  requirements, loan or grant agreements, applicable local, state and  Federal laws and ordinances, and contract obligations, will certify that  no payments have been made to anyone in return for awarding the  management contract to the management agent, and will agree that such  payments will not be made in the future;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The borrower and the management agent will comply with Agency  notices or other policy directives that relate to the management of the  housing project;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The management agreement between the borrower and management  agent complies with the requirements of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The borrower and the management agent will comply with Agency  requirements regarding management fees as specified in paragraph (i) of  this section, and allocation of management costs between the management  fee and the housing project financial accounts specified in Sec.  3560.302(c)(3);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The borrower and the management agent will not purchase goods  and services from entities that have an identity-of-interest (IOI) with  the borrower or the management agent until the IOI relationship has been  disclosed to the Agency according to paragraph (g) of this section, not  denied by the Agency under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and it has  been determined that the costs are as low as or lower than arms-length,  open-market purchases; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The borrower and the management agent agree that all records  related to the housing project are the property of the housing project  and that the Agency, OIG, or GAO may inspect the housing records and the  records of the borrower, management agent, and suppliers of goods and  services having an IOI with the borrower or with a management agent  acting as an agent of the borrower upon demand.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A certification will be executed each time a management agent is  proposed and a management agreement is executed or renewed. Any  amendment to a management certification must be approved by the Agency  and the borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Procurement. The borrower and the agents of the borrower must  obtain contracts, materials, supplies, utilities, and services at a  reasonable cost and seek the most advantageous terms to the housing  project. Any discounts, rebates, fees, proceeds, or commissions  obtainable with respect to purchases, service contracts, or other  transactions must be credited to the housing project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Electronic Submission of Data to Agency. For properties with  eight or more housing units, the Agency may specify that borrowers  submit information required by this part electronically.</p>
