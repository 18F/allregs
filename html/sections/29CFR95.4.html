exceptions are not prohibited by statute. However, in the interest of maximum grant-wide uniformity, exceptions from the requirements of this part shall be permitted only in unusual circumstances. DOL may apply more restrictive requirements to a class of recipients when approved by OMB. DOL may apply less restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except for those requirements which are statutory. Exceptions on a case-by-case basis may also be made by DOL.</p>
