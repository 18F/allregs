                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of this subpart. The request must go to the cognizant OCMI  assigned responsibility for inspections in the country in which the  vessel is operating and will be examined. To qualify for the alternative  annual examination, the vessel must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The request must be in writing and be received by the OCMI not  later than the anniversary date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The vessel is likely to be continuously employed outside of the  United States during the 3 months before and after each anniversary  date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In determining whether to authorize the alternative annual  inspection, the OCMI considers the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information contained in previous examination reports on  inspection and drydock, including the recommendation of the then  cognizant OCMI for participation in the alternative midperiod program  and alternative annual examination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nature, number, and severity of marine casualties or  accidents, as defined in Sec.  4.03-1 of this chapter, involving the  vessel in the 3 years preceding the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The nature, number, and gravity of any outstanding inspection  requirements for the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner's or operator's history of compliance and cooperation  in such   alternative midperiod examinations and annual inspections, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The prompt correction of deficiencies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The reliability of previously submitted reports on such  alternative midperiod examinations and annual inspections.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The reliability of representations that the vessel would be,  and was, employed outside of the United States during the 3 months  before and after each anniversary date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This OCMI provides the applicant with written authorization, if  any, to proceed with the alternative annual inspection, including, when  appropriate, special instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following conditions must be met for the alternative annual  inspection to be accepted instead of the annual inspection required by  Sec.  126.510 of this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The alternative annual inspection must occur within the 3 months  before or after each anniversary date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The alternative annual inspection must be of the scope detailed  by Sec.  126.510(a) of this subchapter and must be conducted by the  master, owner or operator of the vessel, or by a designated  representative of the owner or operator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon completion of the alternative annual inspection, the person  or persons making the examination must prepare a comprehensive report  describing the conditions found. This report must contain sufficient  detail to let the OCMI determine whether the vessel is fit for the  service and route specified on the Certificate of Inspection. This  report must include all reports and receipts documenting the servicing  of lifesaving equipment and any photographs or sketches necessary to  clarify unusual circumstances. Each person preparing this report must  sign it and certify that the information contained therein is complete  and accurate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unless the master of the vessel participated in the alternative  annual inspection and the preparation of the comprehensive report, the  master will review the report for completeness and accuracy. The master  must sign the report to indicate his or her review and validation and  must forward it to the owner or operator of the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The owner or operator of a vessel examined under this section  must review and submit the comprehensive report, required by paragraph  (d)(3) of this section, to the OCMI. The report must reach the OCMI  before the first day of the fifth month following the anniversary date.  The forwarding letter or endorsement must be certified to be true and  must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the person or persons who made the alternative annual  inspection acted on behalf of the vessel's owner or operator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the report was reviewed by the owner or operator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the discrepancies noted during the reinspection have been  corrected, or will be within a stated time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That the owner or operator has sufficient personal knowledge of  conditions aboard the vessel at the time of the reinspection, or has  conducted inquires necessary to justify forming a belief that the report  is complete and accurate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The form of certification required under this section, for the  alternative annual inspection, is as follows:</p><p class="depth2">I certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief the  information contained in the report is complete and accurate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Deficiencies and hazards discovered during the alternative  annual inspection conducted pursuant to this section must be corrected  or eliminated, if practical, before the examination report is submitted  to the OCMI in accordance with paragraph (d)(5) of this section.  Deficiencies and hazards that are not corrected or eliminated by the  time the examination report is submitted must be listed in the report as  ``outstanding.'' Upon receipt of an examination report indicating  outstanding deficiencies or hazards, the OCMI must inform the owner or  operator in writing of the time period within which to correct or  eliminate the deficiencies or hazards and the method for establishing  that the corrections have been accomplished. Where a deficiency or  hazard remains uncorrected or uneliminated after the expiration of the  time specified for correction or   elimination, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection must initiate  appropriate enforcement measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Upon receipt of the report, the OCMI will evaluate it and  determine the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the cognizant OCMI accepts the alternative annual  inspection instead of the annual inspection required by Sec.  126.510(a)  of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the vessel is in satisfactory condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the vessel continues to be reasonably fit for its  intended service and route.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The OCMI may require further information necessary for the  determinations required by this section. The OCMI will inform the owner  or operator in writing of these determinations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If the OCMI, in compliance with paragraph (g) of this section,  does not accept the alternative annual inspection instead of the annual  inspection required by Sec.  126.510(a) of this subpart, he or she will  require reinspection of the vessel as soon as practicable. He or she  will inform the vessel owner or operator in writing that the alternative  examination is not acceptable and that a reinspection is necessary. The  owner, master, or operator must make the vessel available for the  reinspection at a time and place agreeable to this OCMI.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If the OCMI determines, in accordance with paragraph (g) of this  section, that the alternative annual inspection is accepted in lieu of  the annual inspection required by Sec.  126.510(a) of this subpart, the  master must complete the applicable COI endorsement.</p>
