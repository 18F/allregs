Each such request shall include a copy of  the State workers' compensation law and any other pertinent State laws;  a copy of any regulations, either proposed or promulgated, implementing  such laws; and a copy of any relevant administrative or court decision  interpreting such laws or regulations, or, if such decisions are  published in a readily available report, a citation to such decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Secretary may require each State included on the list to  submit reports detailing the extent to which the State's workers'  compensation laws, as reflected by statute, regulation, or  administrative or court decision, continues to meet the requirements of  paragraph (b) of this section. If the Secretary concludes that the  State's workers' compensation law does not provide adequate coverage at  any time, either because of changes to the State workers' compensation  law or the Black Lung Benefits Act, he shall remove the State from the  Secretary's list after providing the State with notice of such removal  and an opportunity to be heard.</p>
