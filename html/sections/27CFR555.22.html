                                Sec.  555.22  Alternate methods or procedures; emergency variations
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Alternate methods or procedures. The permittee or licensee, on specific approval by the Director as provided by this paragraph, may use an alternate method or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in this part. The Director may approve an alternate method or procedure, subject to stated conditions, when he finds that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Good cause is shown for the use of the alternate method or procedure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed method or procedure and that the alternate method or procedure is substantially equivalent to that specifically prescribed method or procedure; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any provision of law and will not result in an increase in cost to the Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.
Where the permittee or licensee desires to employ an alternate method or procedure, he shall submit a written application to the Director, Industry Operations, for transmittal to the Director. The application shall specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure and shall set forth the reasons for it. Alternate methods or procedures may not be employed until the application is approved by the Director. The permittee or licensee shall, during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization of any alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the Director, the effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of the authorization. As used in this paragraph, alternate methods or procedures include alternate construction or equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Emergency variations from requirements. The Director may approve construction, equipment, and methods of operation other than as specified in this part, where he finds that an emergency exists and the proposed variations from the specified requirements are necessary and the proposed variations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Will afford security and protection that are substantially equivalent to those prescribed in this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Will not hinder the effective administration of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Will not be contrary to any provisions of law.
Variations from requirements granted under this paragraph are conditioned on compliance with the procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth in the approval of the application. Failure to comply in good faith with the procedures, conditions, and limitations shall automatically terminate the authority for the variations and the licensee or permittee shall fully comply with the prescribed requirements of regulations from which the variations were authorized. Authority for any variation may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the Director, the effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of the variation. Where the licensee or permittee desires to employ an emergency variation, he

shall submit a written application to the Director, Industry Operations for transmittal to the Director. The application shall describe the proposed variation and set forth the reasons for it. Variations may not be employed until the application is approved, except when the emergency requires immediate action to correct a situation that is threatening to life or property. Corrective action may then be taken concurrent with the filing of the application and notification of the Director via telephone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Retention of approved variations. The licensee or permittee shall retain, as part of his records available for examination by ATF officers, any application approved by the Director under this section.
