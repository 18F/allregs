the program manager apply, with respect to that particular flight, to the affiliate of the owner's program manager rather than to the owner's program manager.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A minimum fractional ownership interest means--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A fractional ownership interest equal to, or greater than, one-sixteenth (\1/16\) of at least one subsonic, fixed-wing or powered-lift program aircraft; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A fractional ownership interest equal to, or greater than, one-thirty-second (\1/32\) of at least one rotorcraft program aircraft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The rules in this subpart that refer to a fractional owner or a fractional ownership program manager also apply to any person who engages in an operation governed by this subpart without the management specifications required by this subpart.</p>
