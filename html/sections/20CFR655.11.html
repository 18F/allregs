An employer must file an H-2B Registration.  The H-2B Registration must be accompanied by documentation evidencing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of positions that will be sought in the first year of  registration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The time period of need for the workers requested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the nature of the employer's need for the services or labor  to be performed is non-agricultural and temporary, and is justified as  either a one-time occurrence, a seasonal need, a peakload need, or an  intermittent need, as defined at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B) and Sec.  655.6 (or in the case of job contractors, a seasonal need or one-time  occurrence); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For job contractors, the job contractor's own seasonal need or  one-time occurrence, such as through the provision of payroll records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Original signature. The H-2B Registration must bear the original  signature of the employer (and that of the employer's attorney or agent  if applicable). If and when the H-2B Registration is permitted to be  filed electronically, the employer will satisfy this requirement by  signing the H-2B Registration as directed by the CO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timeliness of registration filing. A completed request for an H- 2B Registration must be received by no less than 120 calendar days and  no more than 150 calendar days before the employer's date of need,  except where the employer submits the H-2B Registration in support of an  emergency filing under Sec. 655.17.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Temporary need. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer must establish that its need  for non-agricultural services or labor is temporary, regardless of  whether the underlying job is permanent or temporary. 8 CFR  214.2(h)(6)(ii)(A). A job contractor must also demonstrate through  documentation its own seasonal need or one-time occurrence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer's need will be assessed in accordance with the  definitions provided by the Secretary of DHS and as further defined in  Sec. 655.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> NPC review. The CO will review the H-2B Registration and its  accompanying documentation for completeness and make a determination  based on the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The job classification and duties qualify as non-agricultural;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer's need for the services or labor to be performed is  temporary in nature, and for job contractors, demonstration of the job  contractor's own seasonal need or one-time occurrence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The number of worker positions and period of need are justified;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The request represents a bona fide job opportunity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Mailing and postmark requirements. Any notice or request  pertaining to an H-2B Registration sent by the CO to an employer  requiring a response will be mailed to the address provided on the H-2B  Registration using methods to assure next day delivery, including  electronic mail. The employer's response to the notice or request must  be mailed using methods to assure next day delivery, including  electronic mail, and be sent by the due date specified by the CO or by  the next business day if the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or  Federal holiday.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Request for information (RFI). If the CO determines the H-2B  Registration cannot be approved, the CO will issue an RFI. The RFI will  be issued within 7 business days of the CO's receipt of the H-2B  Registration. The RFI will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State the reason(s) why the H-2B Registration cannot be approved  and what supplemental information or documentation is needed to correct  the deficiencies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specify a date, no later than 7 business days from the date the  RFI is issued, by which the supplemental information or documentation  must be sent by the employer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State that, upon receipt of a response to the RFI, the CO will  review the H-2B Registration as well as any supplemental information and  documentation and issue a Notice of Decision on the H-2B Registration.  The CO may, at his or her discretion, issue one or more additional RFIs  before issuing a Notice of Decision on the H-2B Registration; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State that failure to comply with an RFI, including not  responding in a timely manner or not providing all required  documentation within the specified timeframe, will result in a denial of  the H-2B Registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notice of Decision. The CO will notify the employer in writing  of the final decision on the H-2B Registration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approved H-2B Registration. If the H-2B Registration is  approved, the CO will send a Notice of Decision to the employer, and a  copy to the employer's attorney or agent, if applicable. The Notice of  Decision will notify the employer that it is eligible to seek H-2B  workers in the occupational classification for the anticipated number of  positions and period of need stated on the approved H-2B Registration.  The CO may approve the H-2B Registration for a period of up to 3  consecutive years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Denied H-2B Registration. If the H-2B Registration is denied,  the CO will send a Notice of Decision to the employer, and a copy to the  employer's attorney or agent, if applicable. The Notice of Decision  will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State the reason(s) why the H-2B Registration is denied;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Offer the employer an opportunity to request administrative  review under Sec. 655.61 within 10 business days from the date the  Notice of Decision is issued and state that if the employer does not  request administrative review within that period the denial is final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Retention of documents. All employers filing an H-2B  Registration are required to retain any documents and records not  otherwise submitted proving compliance with this subpart. Such records  and documents must be retained for a period of 3 years from the date of  certification of the last Application for Temporary Employment  Certification supported by the H-2B Registration, if approved, or 3  years from the date the decision is issued if the H-2B Registration is  denied or 3 years from the day the Department receives written  notification from the employer withdrawing its pending H-2B  Registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Transition period. In order to allow OFLC to make the necessary  changes to its program operations to accommodate the new registration  process, OFLC will announce in the Federal Register a separate  transition period for the registration process, and until that time,  will continue to   adjudicate temporary need during the processing of applications.
