These regulations are also applicable to the employment of United States (U.S.) workers newly hired by employers of H-2A workers in the same occupations as the H-2A workers during the period of time set forth in the labor certification approved by ETA as a condition for granting H-2A certification, including any extension thereof. Such U.S. workers hired by H-2A employers are hereafter referred to as engaged in corresponding employment.</p>
