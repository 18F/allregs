                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a, subsections (c)(3), (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4), and (e)(1) and (4)(I): Flight Training Candidates File System (JUSTICE/FTTTF-001). This exemption applies only to the extent that information is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemption from the particular subsections is justified for the following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record subject the accounting of disclosures could reveal information that is classified in the interest of national security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From subsection (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4) because access to and amendment of certain portions of records within the system would tend to reveal or compromise information classified in the interest of national security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible to determine in advance if information obtained will be relevant for the purposes of conducting the risk analysis for flight training candidates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From subsection (e)(4)(I) to the extent that this subsection is interpreted to require more detail regarding the record sources in this system than have been published in the Federal Register. Should the subsection be so interpreted, exemption from this provision is necessary because greater specificity concerning the sources of these records could compromise national security.
