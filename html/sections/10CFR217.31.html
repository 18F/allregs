                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Levels of priority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There are two levels of priority established by the Energy Priorities and Allocations System regulations, identified by the rating symbols ``DO'' and ``DX''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All DO-rated orders have equal priority with each other and take precedence over unrated orders. All DX-rated orders have equal priority with each other and take precedence over DO-rated orders and unrated orders. (For resolution of conflicts among rated orders of equal priority, see Sec. 217.34(c).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In addition, a Directive regarding priority treatment for a given item issued by the Department of Energy for that item takes precedence over any DX-rated order, DO-rated order, or unrated order, as stipulated in the Directive. (For a full discussion of Directives, see Sec. 217.62.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Program identification symbols. Program identification symbols indicate which approved program is being supported by a rated order. The list of currently approved programs and their identification symbols are listed in Schedule 1, set forth as an appendix to 15 CFR part 700. For example, DO-F3 identifies a domestic energy construction program. Additional programs may be approved under the procedures of E.O. 12919 at any time. Program identification symbols do not connote any priority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Priority ratings. A priority rating consists of the rating symbol--DO or DX--and the program identification symbol, such as F1, F2, or F3. Thus, a contract for a domestic energy construction program will contain a DO-F3 or DX-F3 priority rating.</p>
