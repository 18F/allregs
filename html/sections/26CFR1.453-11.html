                                Sec. 1.453-11  Installment obligations received from a liquidating
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--(1) Overview. Except as provided in section  453(h)(1)(C) (relating to installment sales of depreciable property to  certain closely related persons), a qualifying shareholder (as defined  in paragraph (b) of this section) who receives a qualifying installment  obligation (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) in a  liquidation that satisfies section 453(h)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(A)</em> treats the receipt of  payments in respect of the obligation, rather than the receipt of the  obligation itself, as a receipt of payment for the shareholder's stock.  The shareholder reports the payments received on the installment method  unless the shareholder elects otherwise in accordance with Sec. 15a.453- 1(d) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Coordination with other provisions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Deemed sale of stock for  installment obligation. Except as specifically provided in section  453(h)(1)(C), a qualifying shareholder treats a qualifying installment  obligation, for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, as if the  obligation is received by the shareholder from the person issuing the  obligation in exchange for the shareholder's stock in the liquidating  corporation. For example, if the stock of a corporation that is  liquidating is traded on an established securities market, an  installment obligation distributed to a shareholder of the corporation  in exchange for the shareholder's stock does not qualify for installment  reporting pursuant to section 453(k)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules to account for the qualifying installment  obligation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Issue price. A qualifying installment obligation is  treated by a qualifying shareholder as newly issued on the date of the  distribution. The issue price of the qualifying installment obligation  on that date is equal to the sum of the adjusted issue price of the  obligation on the date of the distribution (as determined under  Sec. 1.1275-1(b)) and the amount of any qualified stated interest (as  defined in Sec. 1.1273-1(c)) that has accrued prior to the distribution  but that is not payable until after the distribution. For purposes of  the preceding sentence, if the qualifying installment obligation is  subject to Sec. 1.446-2 (e.g., a debt instrument that has unstated  interest under section 483), the adjusted issue price of the obligation  is determined under Sec. 1.446-2(c) and (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Variable rate debt instrument. If the qualifying installment  obligation is a variable rate debt instrument (as defined in  Sec. 1.1275-5), the shareholder uses the equivalent fixed rate debt  instrument (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1275-5(e)(3)(ii)) constructed  for the qualifying installment obligation as of the date the obligation  was issued to the liquidating corporation to determine the accruals of  original issue discount, if any, and interest on the obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Liquidating distributions treated as selling price. All amounts  distributed or treated as distributed to a qualifying shareholder  incident to the liquidation, including cash, the issue price of  qualifying installment obligations as determined under paragraph  (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, and the fair market value of other  property (including obligations that are not qualifying installment  obligations) are considered as having been received by the shareholder  as the selling price (as defined in Sec. 15a.453-1(b)(2)(ii) of this  chapter) for the shareholder's stock in the liquidating corporation. For  the proper method of reporting liquidating distributions received in  more than one taxable year of a shareholder, see paragraph (d) of this  section. An election not to report on the installment method an  installment obligation received in the liquidation applies to all  distributions received in the liquidation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Assumption of corporate liability by shareholders. For purposes  of this section, if in the course of a liquidation a shareholder assumes  secured or unsecured liabilities of the liquidating corporation, or  receives property from the corporation subject to such liabilities  (including any tax liabilities incurred by the corporation on the  distribution), the amount of the liabilities is added   to the shareholder's basis in the stock of the liquidating corporation.  These additions to basis do not affect the shareholder's holding period  for the stock. These liabilities do not reduce the amounts received in  computing the selling price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (a) are illustrated  by the following examples. Except as otherwise provided, assume in each  example that A, an individual who is a calendar-year taxpayer, owns all  of the stock of T corporation. A's adjusted tax basis in that stock is  $100,000. On February 1, 1998, T, an accrual method taxpayer, adopts a  plan of complete liquidation that satisfies section 453(h)(1)(A) and  immediately sells all of its assets to unrelated B corporation in a  single transaction. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The stated purchase price for T's assets is  $3,500,000. In consideration for the sale, B makes a down payment of  $500,000 and issues a 10-year installment obligation with a stated  principal amount of $3,000,000. The obligation provides for interest  payments of $150,000 on January 31 of each year, with the total  principal amount due at maturity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assume that for purposes of section 1274, the test rate on  February 1, 1998, is 8 percent, compounded semi-annually. Also assume  that a semi-annual accrual period is used. Under Sec. 1.1274-2, the  issue price of the obligation on February 1, 1998, is $2,368,450.  Accordingly, the obligation has $631,550 of original issue discount  ($3,000,000-$2,368,450). Between February 1 and July 31, $19,738 of  original issue discount and $75,000 of qualified stated interest accrue  with respect to the obligation and are taken into account by T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On July 31, 1998, T distributes the installment obligation to  A in exchange for A's stock. No other property is ever distributed to A.  On January 31, 1999, A receives the first annual payment of $150,000  from B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When the obligation is distributed to A on July 31, 1998, it is  treated as if the obligation is received by A in an installment sale of  shares directly to B on that date. Under Sec. 1.1275-1(b), the adjusted  issue price of the obligation on that date is $2,388,188 (original issue  price of $2,368,450 plus accrued original issue discount of $19,738).  Accordingly, the issue price of the obligation under paragraph  (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is $2,463,188, the sum of the adjusted  issue price of the obligation on that date ($2,388,188) and the amount  of accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest ($75,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The selling price and contract price of A's stock in T is  $2,463,188, and the gross profit is $2,363,188 ($2,463,188 selling price  less A's adjusted tax basis of $100,000). A's gross profit ratio is thus  96 percent (gross profit of $2,363,188 divided by total contract price  of $2,463,188).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Under Secs. 1.446-2(e)(1) and 1.1275-2(a), $98,527 of the  $150,000 payment is treated as a payment of the interest and original  issue discount that accrued on the obligation from July 31, 1998, to  January 31, 1999 ($75,000 of qualified stated interest and $23,527 of  original issue discount). The balance of the payment ($51,473) is  treated as a payment of principal. A's gain recognized in 1999 is  $49,414 (96 percent of $51,473).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> T owns Blackacre, unimproved real property, with an  adjusted tax basis of $700,000. Blackacre is subject to a mortgage  (underlying mortgage) of $1,100,000. A is not personally liable on the  underlying mortgage and the T shares held by A are not encumbered by the  underlying mortgage. The other assets of T consist of $400,000 of cash  and $600,000 of accounts receivable attributable to sales of inventory  in the ordinary course of business. The unsecured liabilities of T total  $900,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On February 1, 1998, T adopts a plan of complete liquidation  complying with section 453(h)(1)(A), and promptly sells Blackacre to B  for a 4-year mortgage note (bearing adequate stated interest and  otherwise meeting all of the requirements of section 453) in the face  amount of $4 million. Under the agreement between T and B, T (or its  successor) is to continue to make principal and interest payments on the  underlying mortgage. Immediately thereafter, T completes its liquidation  by distributing to A its remaining cash of $400,000 (after payment of  T's tax liabilities), accounts receivable of $600,000, and the $4  million B note. A assumes T's $900,000 of unsecured liabilities and  receives the distributed property subject to the obligation to make  payments on the $1,100,000 underlying mortgage. A receives no payments  from B on the B note during 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Unless A elects otherwise, the transaction is reported by A on  the installment method. The selling price is $5 million (cash of  $400,000, accounts receivable of $600,000, and the B note of $4  million). The total contract price also is $5 million. A's adjusted tax  basis in the T shares, initially $100,000, is increased by the $900,000  of unsecured T liabilities assumed by A and by the obligation (subject  to which A takes the distributed property) to make payments on the  $1,100,000 underlying mortgage on Blackacre, for an aggregate adjusted  tax basis of $2,100,000. Accordingly, the gross profit is $2,900,000  (selling price of $5 million less aggregate adjusted tax basis of  $2,100,000). The gross profit ratio is 58 percent (gross profit of  $2,900,000   divided by the total contract price of $5 million). The 1998 payments to  A are $1 million ($400,000 cash plus $600,000 receivables) and A  recognizes gain in 1998 of $580,000 (58 percent of $1 million).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In 1999, A receives payment from B on the B note of $1 million  (exclusive of interest). A's gain recognized in 1999 is $580,000 (58  percent of $1 million).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Qualifying shareholder. For purposes of this section, qualifying  shareholder means a shareholder to which, with respect to the  liquidating distribution, section 331 applies. For example, a creditor  that receives a distribution from a liquidating corporation, in exchange  for the creditor's claim, is not a qualifying shareholder as a result of  that distribution regardless of whether the liquidation satisfies  section 453(h)(1)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Qualifying installment obligation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes  of this section, qualifying installment obligation means an installment  obligation (other than an evidence of indebtedness described in  Sec. 15a.453-1(e) of this chapter, relating to obligations that are  payable on demand or are readily tradable) acquired in a sale or  exchange of corporate assets by a liquidating corporation during the 12- month period beginning on the date the plan of liquidation is adopted.  See paragraph (c)(4) of this section for an exception for installment  obligations acquired in respect of certain sales of inventory. Also see  paragraph (c)(5) of this section for an exception for installment  obligations attributable to sales of certain property that do not  generally qualify for installment method treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Corporate assets. Except as provided in section 453(h)(1)(C), in  paragraph (c)(4) of this section (relating to certain sales of  inventory), and in paragraph (c)(5) of this section (relating to certain  tax avoidance transactions), the nature of the assets sold by, and the  tax consequences to, the selling corporation do not affect whether an  installment obligation is a qualifying installment obligation. Thus, for  example, the fact that the fair market value of an asset is less than  the adjusted basis of that asset in the hands of the corporation; or  that the sale of an asset will subject the corporation to depreciation  recapture (e.g., under section 1245 or section 1250); or that the assets  of a trade or business sold by the corporation for an installment  obligation include depreciable property, certain marketable securities,  accounts receivable, installment obligations, or cash; or that the  distribution of assets to the shareholder is or is not taxable to the  corporation under sections 336 and 453B, does not affect whether  installment obligations received in exchange for those assets are  treated as qualifying installment obligations by the shareholder.  However, an obligation received by the corporation in exchange for cash,  in a transaction unrelated to a sale or exchange of noncash assets by  the corporation, is not treated as a qualifying installment obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Installment obligations distributed in liquidations described in  section 453(h)(1)(E)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case of a liquidation to  which section 453(h)(1)(E) (relating to certain liquidating subsidiary  corporations) applies, a qualifying installment obligation acquired in  respect of a sale or exchange by the liquidating subsidiary corporation  will be treated as a qualifying installment obligation if distributed by  a controlling corporate shareholder (within the meaning of section  368(c)) to a qualifying shareholder. The preceding sentence is applied  successively to each controlling corporate shareholder, if any, above  the first controlling corporate shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(3) are  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, an individual, owns all of the stock of T  corporation, a C corporation. T has an operating division and three  wholly-owned subsidiaries, X, Y, and Z. On February 1, 1998, T, Y, and Z  all adopt plans of complete liquidation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On March 1, 1998, the following sales are made to unrelated  purchasers: T sells the assets of its operating division to B for cash  and an installment obligation. T sells the stock of X to C for an  installment obligation. Y sells all of its assets to D for an  installment obligation. Z sells all of its assets to E for cash. The B,  C, and D installment obligations bear adequate stated interest and meet  the requirements of section 453.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In June 1998, Y and Z completely liquidate, distributing their  respective assets (the D installment obligation and cash) to T.   In July 1998, T completely liquidates, distributing to A cash and the  installment obligations respectively issued by B, C, and D. The  liquidation of T is a liquidation to which section 453(h) applies and  the liquidations of Y and Z into T are liquidations to which section 332  applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Because T is in control of Y (within the meaning of section  368(c)), the D obligation acquired by Y is treated as acquired by T  pursuant to section 453(h)(1)(E). A is a qualifying shareholder and the  installment obligations issued by B, C, and D are qualifying installment  obligations. Unless A elects otherwise, A reports the transaction on the  installment method as if the cash and installment obligations had been  received in an installment sale of the stock of T corporation. Under  section 453B(d), no gain or loss is recognized by Y on the distribution  of the D installment obligation to T. Under sections 453B(a) and 336, T  recognizes gain or loss on the distribution of the B, C, and D  installment obligations to A in exchange for A's stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, a cash-method individual taxpayer, owns all of the  stock of P corporation, a C corporation. P owns 30 percent of the stock  of Q corporation. The balance of the Q stock is owned by unrelated  individuals. On February 1, 1998, P adopts a plan of complete  liquidation and sells all of its property, other than its Q stock, to B,  an unrelated purchaser for cash and an installment obligation bearing  adequate stated interest. On March 1, 1998, Q adopts a plan of complete  liquidation and sells all of its property to an unrelated purchaser, C,  for cash and installment obligations. Q immediately distributes the cash  and installment obligations to its shareholders in completion of its  liquidation. Promptly thereafter, P liquidates, distributing to A cash,  the B installment obligation, and a C installment obligation that P  received in the liquidation of Q.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the hands of A, the B installment obligation is a qualifying  installment obligation. In the hands of P, the C installment obligation  was a qualifying installment obligation. However, in the hands of A, the  C installment obligation is not treated as a qualifying installment  obligation because P owned only 30 percent of the stock of Q. Because P  did not own the requisite 80 percent stock interest in Q, P was not a  controlling corporate shareholder of Q (within the meaning of section  368(c)) immediately before the liquidation. Therefore, section  453(h)(1)(E) does not apply. Thus, in the hands of A, the C obligation  is considered to be a third-party note (not a purchaser's evidence of  indebtedness) and is treated as a payment to A in the year of  distribution. Accordingly, for 1998, A reports as payment the cash and  the fair market value of the C obligation distributed to A in the  liquidation of P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because P held 30 percent of the stock of Q, section 453B(d)  is inapplicable to P. Under sections 453B(a) and 336, accordingly, Q  recognizes gain or loss on the distribution of the C obligation. P also  recognizes gain or loss on the distribution of the B and C installment  obligations to A in exchange for A's stock. See sections 453B and 336.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Installment obligations attributable to certain sales of  inventory--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An installment obligation acquired by a  corporation in a liquidation that satisfies section 453(h)(1)(A) in  respect of a broken lot of inventory is not a qualifying installment  obligation. If an installment obligation is acquired in respect of a  broken lot of inventory and other assets, only the portion of the  installment obligation acquired in respect of the broken lot of  inventory is not a qualifying installment obligation. The portion of the  installment obligation attributable to other assets is a qualifying  installment obligation. For purposes of this section, the term broken  lot of inventory means inventory property that is sold or exchanged  other than in bulk to one person in one transaction involving  substantially all of the inventory property attributable to a trade or  business of the corporation. See paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section  for rules for determining what portion of an installment obligation is  not a qualifying installment obligation and paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of  this section for rules determining the application of payments on an  installment obligation only a portion of which is a qualifying  installment obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules for determining nonqualifying portion of an installment  obligation. If a broken lot of inventory is sold to a purchaser together  with other corporate assets for consideration consisting of an  installment obligation and either cash, other property, the assumption  of (or taking property subject to) corporate liabilities by the  purchaser, or some combination thereof, the installment obligation is  treated as having been acquired in respect of a broken lot of inventory  only to the extent that the fair market value of the broken lot of  inventory exceeds the sum of unsecured liabilities assumed by the  purchaser, secured liabilities which encumber the broken lot of  inventory and are assumed by the purchaser or to   which the broken lot of inventory is subject, and the sum of the cash  and fair market value of other property received. This rule applies  solely for the purpose of determining the portion of the installment  obligation (if any) that is attributable to the broken lot of inventory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Application of payments. If, by reason of the application of  paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, a portion of an installment  obligation is not a qualifying installment obligation, then for purposes  of determining the amount of gain to be reported by the shareholder  under section 453, payments on the obligation (other than payments of  qualified stated interest) shall be applied first to the portion of the  obligation that is not a qualifying installment obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  this paragraph (c)(4). In this example, assume that all obligations bear  adequate stated interest within the meaning of section 1274(c)(2) and  that the fair market value of each nonqualifying installment obligation  equals its face amount. The example is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P corporation has three operating divisions, X, Y, and  Z, each engaged in a separate trade or business, and a minor amount of  investment assets. On July 1, 1998, P adopts a plan of complete  liquidation that meets the criteria of section 453(h)(1)(A). The  following sales are promptly made to purchasers unrelated to P: P sells  all of the assets of the X division (including all of the inventory  property) to B for $30,000 cash and installment obligations totalling  $200,000. P sells substantially all of the inventory property of the Y  division to C for a $100,000 installment obligation, and sells all of  the other assets of the Y division (excluding cash but including  installment receivables previously acquired in the ordinary course of  the business of the Y division) to D for a $170,000 installment  obligation. P sells \1/3\ of the inventory property of the Z division to  E for $100,000 cash, \1/3\ of the inventory property of the Z division  to F for a $100,000 installment obligation, and all of the other assets  of the Z division (including the remaining \1/3\ of the inventory  property worth $100,000) to G for $60,000 cash, a $240,000 installment  obligation, and the assumption by G of the liabilities of the Z  division. The liabilities assumed by G, which are unsecured liabilities  and liabilities encumbering the inventory property acquired by G,  aggregate $30,000. Thus, the total purchase price G pays is $330,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> P immediately completes its liquidation, distributing the cash  and installment obligations, which otherwise meet the requirements of  section 453, to A, an individual cash-method taxpayer who is its sole  shareholder. In 1999, G makes a payment to A of $100,000 (exclusive of  interest) on the $240,000 installment obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the hands of A, the installment obligations issued by B, C,  and D are qualifying installment obligations because they were timely  acquired by P in a sale or exchange of its assets. In addition, the  installment obligation issued by C is a qualifying installment  obligation because it arose from a sale to one person in one transaction  of substantially all of the inventory property of the trade or business  engaged in by the Y division.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The installment obligation issued by F is not a qualifying  installment obligation because it is in respect of a broken lot of  inventory. A portion of the installment obligation issued by G is a  qualifying installment obligation and a portion is not a qualifying  installment obligation, determined as follows: G purchased part of the  inventory property (with a fair market value of $100,000) and all of the  other assets of the Z division by paying cash ($60,000), issuing an  installment obligation ($240,000), and assuming liabilities of the Z  division ($30,000). The assumed liabilities ($30,000) and cash ($60,000)  are attributed first to the inventory property. Therefore, only $10,000  of the $240,000 installment obligation is attributed to inventory  property. Accordingly, in the hands of A, the G installment obligation  is a qualifying installment obligation to the extent of $230,000, but is  not a qualifying installment obligation to the extent of the $10,000  attributable to the inventory property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the 1998 liquidation of P, A receives a liquidating  distribution as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Qualifying   Cash and</p><p class="depth0">Item                        installment    other</p><p class="depth0">obligations   property ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Cash............................................  ...........   $190,000 B note..........................................    $200,000   .........

Under the installment method, A's selling price and the  contract price are both $1 million, the gross profit is $900,000  (selling price of $1 million less adjusted tax basis of $100,000), and  the gross profit ratio is 90 percent (gross profit   of $900,000 divided by the contract price of $1 million). Accordingly,  in 1998, A reports gain of $270,000 (90 percent of $300,000 payment in  cash and other property). A's adjusted tax basis in each of the  qualifying installment obligations is an amount equal to 10 percent of  the obligation's respective face amount. A's adjusted tax basis in the F  note, a nonqualifying installment obligation, is $100,000, i.e., the  fair market value of the note when received by A. A's adjusted tax basis  in the G note, a mixed obligation, is $33,000 (10 percent of the  $230,000 qualifying installment obligation portion of the note, plus the  $10,000 nonqualifying portion of the note).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> With respect to the $100,000 payment received from G in 1999,  $10,000 is treated as the recovery of the adjusted tax basis of the  nonqualifying portion of the G installment obligation and $9,000 (10  percent of $90,000) is treated as the recovery of the adjusted tax basis  of the portion of the note that is a qualifying installment obligation.  The remaining $81,000 (90 percent of $90,000) is reported as gain from  the sale of A's stock. See paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)(ii)</em> of this section, is not a  qualifying obligation if the corporation is formed or availed of for a  principal purpose of avoiding section 453(b)(2) (relating to dealer  dispositions and certain other dispositions of personal property),  section 453</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> (relating to sales of property subject to recapture), or  section 453(k) (relating to dispositions under a revolving credit plan  and sales of stock or securities traded on an established securities  market) through the use of a party bearing a relationship, either  directly or indirectly, described in section 267(b) to any shareholder  of the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> if, within 12 months before or after the adoption of the plan  of liquidation, the property was owned by any shareholder and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The shareholder regularly sold or otherwise disposed of personal  property of the same type on the installment plan or the property is  real property that the shareholder held for sale to customers in the  ordinary course of a trade or business (provided the property is not  described in section 453(l)(2) (relating to certain exceptions to the  definition of dealer dispositions));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The sale of the property by the shareholder would result in  recapture income (within the meaning of section 453(i)(2)), but only if  the amount of the recapture income is equal to or greater than 50  percent of the property's fair market value on the date of the sale by  the corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The property is stock or securities that are traded on an  established securities market; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The sale of the property by the shareholder would have been  under a revolving credit plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Safe harbor. Paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section will not  apply to the liquidation of a corporation if, on the date the plan of  complete liquidation is adopted and thereafter, less than 15 percent of  the fair market value of the corporation's assets is attributable to  property described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(5) are  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Ten percent of the fair market value of the assets of T is  attributable to stock and securities traded on an established securities  market. T owns no other assets described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this  section. T, after adopting a plan of complete liquidation, sells all of  its stock and securities holdings to C corporation in exchange for an  installment obligation bearing adequate stated interest, sells all of  its other assets to B corporation for cash, and distributes the cash and  installment obligation to its sole shareholder, A, in a complete  liquidation that satisfies section 453(h)(1)(A). Because the C  installment obligation arose from a sale of publicly traded stock and  securities, T cannot report the gain on the sale under the installment  method pursuant to section 453(k)(2). In the hands of A, however, the C  installment obligation is treated as having arisen out of a sale of the  stock of T corporation. In addition, the general rule of paragraph  (c)(5)(i) of this section does not apply, even if a principal purpose of  the liquidation was the avoidance of section 453(k)(2), because the fair  market value of the publicly traded stock and securities is less than 15  percent of the total fair market value of T's assets. Accordingly,  section 453(k)(2) does not apply to A, and A may use the installment  method to report the gain recognized on the payments it receives in  respect of the obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Liquidating distributions received in more than one taxable  year. If a qualifying shareholder receives liquidating distributions to  which this section applies in more than one taxable year, the  shareholder must reasonably estimate the gain attributable to  distributions received in each taxable year. In allocating basis to  calculate the gain for a taxable year, the shareholder must reasonably  estimate the anticipated aggregate distributions. For this purpose, the  shareholder must take into account distributions and other relevant  events or information that the shareholder knows or reasonably could  know up to the date on which the federal income tax return for that year  is filed. If the gain for a taxable year is properly taken into account  on the basis of a reasonable estimate and the exact amount is  subsequently determined the difference, if any, must be taken into  account for the taxable year in which the subsequent determination is  made. However, the shareholder may file an amended return for the  earlier year in lieu of taking the difference into account for the  subsequent taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable to distributions of  qualifying installment obligations made on or after January 28, 1998.  [T.D. 8762, 63 FR 4170, Jan. 28, 1998]</p>
