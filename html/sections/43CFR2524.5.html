                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Act of July 24, 1912. Under the Act of July 24, 1912 (37 Stat.  200; 43 U.S.C. 449), desert-land entries covering lands within the  exterior limits of a Government reclamation project may be assigned in  whole or in part, even though water-right application has been filed for  the land in connection with the Government reclamation project, or   application for an extension of time in which to submit proof on the  entry has been submitted, under the Act of June 27, 1906 (34 Stat. 520;  43 U.S.C. 448), as amended by the Act of June 6, 1930 (46 Stat. 502; 43  U.S.C. 448), requiring reduction of the area of the entry to one farm  unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amendment of farm-unit plat after partial assignment. Where it  is desired to assign part of a desert-land entry which has been  designated as a farm unit, application for the amendment of the farm- unit plat should be filed with the official in charge of the project, as  in the case of assignments of homestead entries. (See Sec. 2515.5  (a)(3) to (5).) The same disposition of amendatory diagrams will be made  and the same procedure followed as provided for assignments of homestead  entries.</p>
