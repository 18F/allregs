                                Sec. 536.154  Claims involving tortfeasors other than nonappropriated
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The risk management program (RIMP) is administered by the U.S. Army  Community and Family Support Center under the provisions of AR 215-1 and  AR 608-10 (Family Child Care Provider Claims). Providers in order to  encourage authorized personnel, that is, military and civilian  employees, to use the family child care program and sports equipment,  such claims are processed in a manner similar to NAFI claims in  Sec. Sec. 536.146 through 536.152 of this subpart. Certain claims are  payable from nonappropriated funds even though the U.S. is not liable  under the FTCA or the MCA as the tortfeasor is not an appropriated fund  or nonappropriated fund employee.</p>
