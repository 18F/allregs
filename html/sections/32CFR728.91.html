Generally, expenses incurred for procurement of such items, either from civilian sources as supplemental care or from stocks maintained by the facility, are payable from operation and maintenance funds available for support of naval MTFs. However, certain adjuncts may be cost-shared under CHAMPUS for CHAMPUS-eligible individuals under circumstances enumerated in the cooperative care or services criteria of Sec. 728.4(z).</p>
