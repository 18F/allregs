                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for  proficiency testing in syphilis serology, a program must provide a  minimum of five samples per testing event. There must be at least three  testing events at approximately equal intervals per year. The samples  may be provided through mailed shipments or, at HHS' option, may be  provided to HHS or its designee for on-site testing. An annual program  must include samples that cover the full range of reactivity from highly  reactive to non-reactive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's response for  qualitative and quantitative syphilis tests, the program must compare  the laboratory's response with the response that reflects agreement of  either 80 percent of ten or more referee laboratories or 80 percent or  more of all participating laboratories. The proficiency testing program  must indicate the minimum concentration, by method, that will be  considered as indicating a positive response. The score for a sample in  syphilis serology is the average of scores determined under paragraphs  (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For quantitative syphilis tests, the program must determine the  correct response for each method by the distance of the response from  the target value. After the target value has been established for each  response, the appropriateness of the response must be determined by  using fixed criteria. The criterion for acceptable performance for  quantitative syphilis serology tests is the target value 1B1 dilution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The criterion for acceptable performance for qualitative  syphilis serology tests is reactive or nonreactive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To determine the overall testing event score, the number of  correct responses must be averaged using the following formula: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25SE06.022   [57 FR 7151, Feb. 28, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 5229, Jan. 19, 1993; 68  FR 3702, Jan. 24, 2003]</p>
