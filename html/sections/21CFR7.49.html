                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A recalling firm is responsible for promptly notifying  each of its affected direct accounts about the recall. The format,  content, and extent of a recall communication should be commensurate  with the hazard of the product being recalled and the strategy developed  for that recall. In general terms, the purpose of a recall communication  is to convey:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the product in question is subject to a recall.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That further distribution or use of any remaining product should  cease immediately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where appropriate, that the direct account should in turn notify  its customers who received the product about the recall.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Instructions regarding what to do with the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Implementation. A recall communication can be accomplished by  telegrams, mailgrams, or first class letters conspicuously marked,  preferably in bold red type, on the letter and the envelope: ``drug [or  food, biologic, etc.] recall [or correction]''. The letter and the  envelope should be also marked: ``urgent'' for class I and class   II recalls and, when appropriate, for class III recalls. Telephone calls  or other personal contacts should ordinarily be confirmed by one of the  above methods and/or documented in an appropriate manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A recall communication should be written in  accordance with the following guidelines:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be brief and to the point;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify clearly the product, size, lot number(s), code(s) or  serial number(s) and any other pertinent descriptive information to  enable accurate and immediate identification of the product;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Explain concisely the reason for the recall and the hazard  involved, if any;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provide specific instructions on what should be done with  respect to the recalled products; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Provide a ready means for the recipient of the communication to  report to the recalling firm whether it has any of the product, e.g., by  sending a postage-paid, self-addressed postcard or by allowing the  recipient to place a collect call to the recalling firm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The recall communication should not contain irrelevant  qualifications, promotional materials, or any other statement that may  detract from the message. Where necessary, followup communications  should be sent to those who fail to respond to the initial recall  communication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Responsibility of recipient. Consignees that receive a recall  communication should immediately carry out the instructions set forth by  the recalling firm and, where necessary, extend the recall to its  consignees in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p>
