                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section deals with the right of the United States  to recover from third-parties the costs of medical care furnished to or  paid on behalf of TRICARE beneficiaries. These third-parties may be  individuals or entities that are liable for tort damages to the injured  TRICARE beneficiary or a liability insurance carrier covering the  individual or entity. These third-parties may also include other  entities who are primarily responsible to pay for the medical care  provided to the injured beneficiary by reason of an insurance policy,  workers' compensation program or other source of primary payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Third-party payers. This part implements the  provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1095b which, in general, allow the Secretary of  Defense to authorize certain TRICARE claims to be paid, even though a  third-party payer may be primary payer, with authority to collect from  the third-party payer the TRICARE costs incurred on behalf of the  beneficiary. (See Sec. 199.2 for definition of ``third-party payer.'')  Therefore, 10 U.S.C. 1095b establishes the statutory obligation of  third-party payers to reimburse the United States the costs incurred on  behalf of TRICARE beneficiaries who are also covered by the third-party  payer's plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal Medical Care Recovery Act--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. In many cases  covered by this section, the United States has a right to collect under  both 10 U.S.C. 1095b and the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (FMCRA),  Public Law 87-693 (42 U.S.C. 2651 et. seq.). In such cases, the  authority is concurrent and the United States may pursue collection  under both statutory authorities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cases involving tort liability. In cases in which the right of  the United States to collect from an automobile liability insurance  carrier is premised on establishing some tort liability on some third  person, matters regarding the determination of such tort liability shall  be governed by the same substantive standards as would be applied under  the FMCRA including reliance on state law for determinations regarding  tort liability. In addition, the provisions of 28 CFR part 43  (Department   of Justice regulations pertaining to the FMCRA) shall apply to claims  made under the concurrent authority of the FMCRA and 10 U.S.C. 1095b.  All other matters and procedures concerning the right of the United  States to collect shall, if a claim is made under the concurrent  authority of the FMCRA and this section, be governed by 10 U.S.C. 1095b  and this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appealability. This section describes the procedures to be  followed in the assertion and collection of third-party recovery claims  in favor of the United States arising from the operation of TRICARE.  Actions taken under this section are not initial determinations for the  purpose of the appeal procedures of Sec. 199.10 of this part. However,  the proper exercise of the right to appeal benefit or provider status  determinations under the procedures set forth in Sec. 199.10 may affect  the processing of federal claims arising under this section. Those  appeal procedures afford a TRICARE beneficiary or participating provider  an opportunity for administrative appellate review in cases in which  benefits have been denied and in which there is a significant factual  dispute. For example, a TRICARE contractor may deny payment for services  that are determined to be excluded as TRICARE benefits because they are  found to be not medically necessary. In that event the TRICARE  contractor will offer an administrative appeal as provided in  Sec. 199.10 of this part on the medical necessity issue raised by the  adverse benefit determination. If the care in question results from an  accidental injury and if the appeal results in a reversal of the initial  determination to deny the benefit, a third-party recovery claim may  arise as a result of the appeal decision to pay the benefit. However, in  no case is the decision to initiate such a claim itself appealable under  Sec. 199.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Statutory obligation of third-party payer to pay--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Basic  Rule. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095b, when the Secretary of Defense  authorizes certain TRICARE claims to be paid, even though a third-party  payer may be primary payer (as specified under Sec. 199.8(c)(2)), the  right to collect from a third-party payer the TRICARE costs incurred on  behalf of the beneficiary is the same as exists for the United States to  collect from third-party payers the cost of care provided by a facility  of the uniformed services under 10 U.S.C. 1095 and part 220 of this  title. Therefore the obligation of a third-party payer to pay is to the  same extent that the beneficiary would be eligible to receive  reimbursement or indemnification from the third-party payer if the  beneficiary were to incur the costs on the beneficiary's own behalf.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application of cost shares. If the third-party payer's plan  includes a requirement for a deductible or copayment by the beneficiary  of the plan, then the amount the United States may collect from the  third-party payer is the cost of care incurred on behalf of the  beneficiary less the appropriate deductible or copayment amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Claim from the United States exclusive. The only way for a  third-party payer to satisfy its obligation under 10 U.S.C. 1095b is to  pay the United States or authorized representative of the United States.  Payment by a third-party payer to the beneficiary does not satisfy 10  U.S.C. 1095b.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Assignment of benefits not necessary. The obligation of the  third-party to pay is not dependent upon the beneficiary executing an  assignment of benefits to the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exclusions impermissible--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Statutory requirement. With the  same right to collect from third-party payers as exists under 10 U.S.C.  1095(b), no provision of any third-party payer's plan having the effect  of excluding from coverage or limiting payment for certain care if that  care is provided or paid by the United States shall operate to prevent  collection by the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Regulatory application. No provision of any third-party payer's  plan or program purporting to have the effect of excluding or limiting  payment for certain care that would not be given such effect under the  standards established in part 220 of this title to implement 10 U.S.C.  1095 shall operate to exclude or limit payment under 10 U.S.C. 1095b or  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Records available. When requested, TRICARE contractors or other  representatives of the United States shall   make available to representatives of any third-party payer from which  the United States seeks payment under 10 U.S.C. 1095b, for inspection  and review, appropriate health care records (or copies of such records)  of individuals for whose care payment is sought. Appropriate records  which will be made available are records which document that the TRICARE  costs incurred on behalf of beneficiaries which are the subject of the  claims for payment under 10 U.S.C. 1095b were incurred as claimed and  the health care service were provided in a manner consistent with  permissible terms and conditions of the third-party payer's plan. This  is the sole purpose for which patient care records will be made  available. Records not needed for this purpose will not be made  available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Remedies. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095b, when the Director,  TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, authorizes certain TRICARE  claims to be paid, even though a third-party payer may be primary payer,  the right to collect from a third-party payer the TRICARE costs incurred  on behalf of the beneficiary is the same as exists for the United States  to collect from third-party payers the cost of care provided by a  facility of the uniformed services under 10 U.S.C. 1095.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> for the  United States to institute and prosecute legal proceedings against a  third-party payer to enforce a right of the United States under 10  U.S.C. 1095b and this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> for  an authorized representative of the United States to compromise, settle  or waive a claim of the United States under 10 U.S.C. 1095b and this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The authorities provided by the Federal Claims Collection Act of  1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3701 et. seq.) and any implementing  regulations (including Sec. 199.11) regarding collection of indebtedness  due the United States shall also be available to effect collections  pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095b and this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Obligations of beneficiaries. To insure the expeditious and  efficient processing of third-party payer claims, any person furnished  care and treatment under TRICARE, his or her guardian, personal  representative, counsel, estate, dependents or survivors shall be  required:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To provide information regarding coverage by a third-party payer  plan and/or the circumstances surrounding an injury to the patient as a  conditional precedent of the processing of a TRICARE claim involving  possible third-party payer coverage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To furnish such additional information as may be requested  concerning the circumstances giving rise to the injury or disease for  which care and treatment are being given and concerning any action  instituted or to be instituted by or against a third person; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To cooperate in the prosecution of all claims and actions by the  United States against such third person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Responsibility for recovery. The Director, TRICARE Management  Activity, or a designee, is responsible for insuring that TRICARE claims  arising under 10 U.S.C. 1095b and this section (including claims  involving the FMCRA) are properly referred to and coordinated with  designated claims authorities of the uniformed services who shall assert  and recover TRICARE costs incurred on behalf of beneficiaries.  Generally, claims arising under this section will be processed as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification and referral. In most cases where civilian  providers provide medical care and payment for such care has been by a  TRICARE contractor, initial identification of potential third-party  payers will be by the TRICARE contractor. In such cases, the TRICARE  contractor is responsible for conducting a preliminary investigation and  referring the case to designated appropriate claims authorities of the  Uniformed Services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Processing TRICARE claims. When the TRICARE contractor initially  identifies a claim as involving a potential third-party payer, it shall  request additional information concerning the circumstances of the  injury or disease and/or the identify of any potential third-party payer  from the beneficiary or other responsible party unless adequate  information is submitted with the claim. The TRICARE claim will be   suspended and no payment issued pending receipt of the requested  information. If the requested information is not received, the claim  will be denied. A TRICARE beneficiary may expedite the processing of his  or her TRICARE claim by submitting appropriate information with the  first claim for treatment of an accidental injury. Third-party payer  information normally is required only once concerning any single  accidental injury on episode of care. Once the third-party payer  information pertaining to a single incident or episode of care is  received, subsequent claims associated with the same incident or episode  of care may be processed to payment in the usual manner. If, however,  the requested third-party payer information is not received, subsequent  claims involving the same incident or episode of care will be suspended  or denied as stated above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ascertaining total potential liability. It is essential that the  appropriate claims responsible for asserting the claim against the  third-party payer receive from the TRICARE contractor a report of all  amounts expended by the United States for care resulting from the  incident upon which potential liability in the third party is based  (including amounts paid by TRICARE for both inpatient and outpatient  care). Prior to assertion and final settlement of a claim, it will be  necessary for the responsible claims authority to secure from the  TRICARE contractor updated information to insure that all amounts  expended under TRICARE are included in the government's claim. It is  equally important that information on future medical payments be  obtained through the investigative process and included as a part of the  government's claim. No TRICARE-related claim will be settled,  compromised or waived without full consideration being given to the  possible future medical payment aspects of the individual case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Reporting requirements. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1079a, all refunds  and other amounts collected in the administration of TRICARE shall be  credited to the appropriation available for that program for the fiscal  year in which the refund or amount is collected. Therefore, the  Department of Defense requires an annual report stating the number and  dollar amount of claims asserted against, and the number and dollar  amount of recoveries from third-party payers (including FMCRA  recoveries) arising from the operation of the TRICARE. To facilitate the  preparation of this report and to maintain program integrity, the  following reporting requirements are established:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> TRICARE contractors. Each TRICARE contractor shall submit on or  before January 31 of each year an annual report to the Director, TRICARE  Management Activity, or a designee, covering the 12 months of the  previous calendar year. This report shall contain, as a minimum, the  number and total dollar of cases of potential third-party payer/FMCRA  liability referred to uniformed services claims authorities for further  investigation and collection. These figures are to be itemized by the  states and uniformed services to which the cases are referred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Uniformed Services. Each uniformed service will submit to the  Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or designee, an annual report  covering the 12 calendar months of the previous year, setting forth, as  a minimum, the number and total dollar amount of cases involving TRICARE  payments received from TRICARE contractors, the number and dollar amount  of cases involving TRICARE payments received from other sources, and the  number and dollar amount of claims actually asserted against, and the  dollar amount of recoveries from, third-payment payers or under the  FMCRA. The report, itemized by state and foreign claims jurisdictions,  shall be provided no later than February 28 of each year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Implementation of the reporting requirements. The Director,  TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee shall issue guidance for  implementation of the reporting requirements prescribed by this section.  [68 FR 6619, Feb. 10, 2003]</p>
