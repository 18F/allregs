                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Execution and issuance of marketing agreement. If the Secretary  has approved a marketing agreement, as provided in Sec. 900.13a, the  Administrator shall cause copies thereof to be distributed for execution  by the handlers eligible to become parties thereto. If and when such  number of the handlers as the Secretary shall deem sufficient shall have  executed the agreement, the Secretary shall execute the agreement. After  execution of a marketing agreement, such agreement shall be filed with  the hearing clerk, and notice thereof, together with notice of the  effective date, shall be given by publication in the Federal Register.  The marketing agreement shall not become effective less than 30 days  after its publication in the Federal Register, unless the Secretary,  upon good cause   found and published with the agreement, fixes an earlier effective date  therefor: Provided, That no marketing agreement shall become effective  as to any person signatory thereto before either (1) it has been filed  with the Office of the Federal Register, or (2) such person has received  actual notice that the Secretary has executed the agreement and the  effective date of the marketing agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Issuance of marketing order with marketing agreement. Whenever,  as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary executes a  marketing agreement, and handlers also have executed the same as  provided in section 8c(8) of the Act, he shall, if he finds that it will  tend to effectuate the purposes of the Act, issue and make effective the  marketing order, if any, which was filed as a part of his decision  pursuant to Sec. 900.13a: Provided, That the issuance of such order  shall have been approved or favored by producers as required by section  8c(8) of the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Issuance of marketing order without marketing agreement. If,  despite the failure or refusal of handlers to sign the marketing  agreement, as provided in section 8c(8) of the Act, the Secretary makes  the determinations required under section 8c(9) of the Act, the  Secretary shall issue and make effective the marketing order, if any,  which was filed as a part of his decision pursuant to Sec. 900.13a.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date of marketing order. No marketing order shall  become effective less than 30 days after its publication in the Federal  Register, unless the Secretary, upon good cause found and published with  the order, fixes an earlier effective date therefor: Provided, That no  marketing order shall become effective as to any person sought to be  charged thereunder before either (1) it has been filed with the Office  of the Federal Register, or (2) such person has received actual notice  of the issuance and terms of the marketing order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice of issuance. After issuance of a marketing order, such  order shall be filed with the hearing clerk, and notice therof, together  with notice of the effective date, shall be given by publication in the  Federal Register.
