The regulations in this part implement the Convention on  International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also  known as CITES, the Convention, the Treaty, or the Washington  Convention, TIAS (Treaties and Other International Acts Series) 8249.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. The aim of CITES is to regulate international trade in  wildlife and plants, including parts, products, and derivatives, to  ensure it is legal and does not threaten the survival of species in the  wild. Parties, recognize that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wildlife and plants are an irreplaceable part of the natural  systems of the earth and must be protected for this and future  generations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The value of wildlife and plants is ever-growing from the  viewpoints of aesthetics, science, culture, recreation, and economics.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Although countries should be the best protectors of their own  wildlife and plants, international cooperation is essential to protect  wildlife and plant species from over-exploitation through international  trade.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It is urgent that countries take appropriate measures to prevent  illegal   trade and ensure that any use of wildlife and plants is sustainable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> National legislation. We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  (FWS), implement CITES through the Endangered Species Act (ESA).</p>
