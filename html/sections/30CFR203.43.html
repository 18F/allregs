                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must apply the RSV prescribed in Sec.  203.41(b) and (c) to gas volumes produced from qualified wells on or after May 3, 2004, reported on the OGOR-A for your lease under 30 CFR 1210.102, as and to the extent prescribed in Sec. Sec.  203.43 and 203.48.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, all gas production from qualified wells reported on the OGOR-A, including production that is not subject to royalty, counts toward the lease RSV.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Production to which an RSS applies under Sec. Sec.  203.45 and 203.46 does not count toward the lease RSV.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well when no part of the lease is within a BSEE-approved unit. Subject to the price conditions in Sec.  203.48, you must apply the RSV prescribed in Sec.  203.41 as required under the following paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> May 3, 2004, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> May 18, 2007, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date that the first qualified well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must apply the RSV to only gas production from qualified wells on your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in Sec.  203.35 or Sec.  203.44.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1: On a lease in water less than 200 meters deep, you began drilling an original deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 18,200 feet TVD SS in September 2003, that became a qualified deep well in July 2004, when it began producing and using the RSV that it earned. You subsequently drill another original deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,600 feet TVD SS, which becomes a qualified deep well when production begins in August 2008. The first well earned an RSV of 25 BCF (see Sec.  203.41(a)(1) and (b)(3)). You must apply any remaining RSV each month beginning in August 2008 to production from both wells until the 25 BCF RSV is fully utilized according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the second well had begun production in August 2009, it would not be a qualified deep well because it started production after expiration in May 2009 of the ability to qualify for royalty relief in this water depth, and could not share any of the remaining RSV (see definition of a qualified deep well in Sec.  203.0).</p><p class="depth3">Example 2: On a lease in water between 200 and 400 meters deep, you begin drilling an original deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 17,100 feet TVD SS in November 2010 that becomes a qualified deep well in June 2011 when it begins producing and using the RSV. You subsequently drill another original deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 15,300 feet TVD SS which becomes a qualified deep well by beginning production in October 2011 (see definition of a qualified deep well in Sec.  203.0). Only the first well earns an RSV equal to 15 BCF (see Sec.  203.41(a) and (b)). You must apply any remaining RSV each month beginning in October 2011 to production from both qualified deep wells until the 15 BCF RSV is fully utilized according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well when all or part of the lease is within a BSEE-approved unit. Under the unit agreement, a share of the production from all the qualified wells in the unit participating area would be allocated to your lease each month according to the participating area percentages. Subject to the price conditions in Sec.  203.48, you must apply the RSV prescribed under Sec.  203.41 as required under the following paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> May 3, 2004, for an RSV earned by a qualified well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> May 18, 2007, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date that the first qualified well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must apply the RSV to only gas production:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> From all qualified wells on the non-unitized area of your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in Sec.  203.35 or Sec.  203.44; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Allocated to your lease under a BSEE-approved unit agreement from qualified wells on unitized areas of your lease and on unitized areas of other leases in the unit, regardless of their depth, for which the requirements in Sec.  203.35 or Sec.  203.44 have been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The allocated share under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section does not increase the RSV for your lease. None of the volumes produced from a well that is not within a unit participating area may be allocated to other leases in the unit.</p><p class="depth3">Example: The east half of your lease A is unitized with all of lease B. There is one qualified 19,000-foot TVD SS deep well on the non-unitized portion of lease A, one qualified 18,500-foot TVD SS deep well on the unitized portion of lease A, and a qualified 19,400-foot TVD SS deep well on lease B. The participating area percentages allocate 32 percent of production from both of the unit qualified deep wells to lease A and 68 percent to lease B. If the non-unitized qualified deep well on lease A produces 12 BCF and the unitized qualified deep well on lease A produces 15 BCF, and the qualified deep well on lease B produces 10 BCF, then the production volume from and allocated to lease A to which the lease an RSV applies is 20 BCF [12 + (15 + 10) * (0.32)]. The production volume allocated to lease B to which the lease B RSV applies is 17 BCF [(15 + 10) * (0.68)].</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must begin paying royalties when the cumulative production of gas from all qualified wells on your lease, or allocated to your lease under paragraph (c) of this section, reaches the applicable RSV allowed under Sec.  203.31 or Sec.  203.41. For the month in which cumulative production reaches this RSV, you owe royalties on the portion of gas production that exceeds the RSV remaining at the beginning of that month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You may not apply the RSV allowed under Sec.  203.41 to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Production from completions less than 15,000 feet TVD SS, except in cases where the qualified deep well is re-perforated in the same reservoir previously perforated deeper than 15,000 feet TVD SS;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Production from a deep well or phase 1 ultra-deep well on any other lease, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any liquid hydrocarbon (oil and condensate) volumes; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Production from a deep well or phase 1 ultra-deep well that commenced drilling before:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> March 26, 2003, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> May 18, 2007, on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep.</p>
