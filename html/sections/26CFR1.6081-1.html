                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a))</em>, as specified in section  6072(b), shall not be granted. Except in the case of an extension of  time pursuant to Sec. 1.6081-5, an extension of time for filing an  income tax return shall not operate to extend the time for the payment  of the tax unless specified to the contrary in the extension. For rules  relating to extensions of time for paying tax, see Sec. 1.6161-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application for extension of time--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under other  sections in this chapter, certain taxpayers may request an automatic  extension of time to file certain returns. Except in undue hardship  cases, no extension of time to file a return will be allowed under this  section until an automatic extension of time to file the return has been  allowed under the applicable section. No extension of time to file a  return will be granted under this section for a period of time greater  than that provided for by automatic extension. A taxpayer desiring an  extension of the time for filing a return, statement, or other document  shall submit an application for extension on or before the due date of  such return, statement, or other document. If a form exists for the  application for an extension, the taxpayer should use the form; however,  taxpayers may apply for an extension in a letter that includes the  information required by this paragraph. Except as provided in Sec.  301.6091-1(b) of this chapter (relating to hand-carried documents), the  taxpayer should make the application for extension to the Internal  Revenue Service office where such return, statement, or other document  is required to be filed. Except for requests for automatic extensions of  time to file certain returns provided for elsewhere in this chapter, the  application must be in writing, signed by the taxpayer or his duly  authorized agent, and must clearly set forth--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The particular tax return, information return, statement, or  other document, including the taxable year or period thereof, for which  the taxpayer requests an extension; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An explanation of the reasons for requesting the extension to  aid the internal revenue officer in determining whether to grant the  request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taxpayer unable to sign. In any case in which a taxpayer is  unable, by reason of illness, absence, or other good cause, to sign a  request for an extension, any person standing in close personal or  business relationship to the taxpayer may sign the request on his  behalf, and shall be considered as a duly authorized agent for this  purpose, provided the request sets forth the reasons for a signature  other than the taxpayer's and the relationship existing between the  taxpayer and the signer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective/applicability dates. This section applies to requests  for extension of time filed after July 1, 2008.
