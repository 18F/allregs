Periodically the CCC will inform the public of the  process by which interested eligible organizations may submit proposals  for TASC program funding.

The CCC  also may announce the availability of a Quick Response Fund within the  TASC program. Proposals submitted under any form of quick response  process may be submitted at any time during the year but must meet the  basic requirements of the program and any specific requirements of that  particular process. Organizations interested in participating in the  TASC program may submit their proposals electronically or in paper copy.  Although no specific format is required, a sample format for proposals  is available from the address provided in this rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of proposals.
