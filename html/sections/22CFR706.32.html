                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Confidential commercial information means  commercial or financial information obtained from a submitter that may  be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA. Exemption 4  protects:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Trade secrets; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Commercial or financial information that is privileged or  confidential where either: Disclosure of the information would cause  substantial competitive harm to the submitter, or the information is  voluntarily submitted and would not customarily be publicly released by  the submitter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submitter means any person or entity who provides confidential  commercial information to OPIC, directly or indirectly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Designation of confidential commercial information. All  submitters may designate, by appropriate markings, any portions of their  submissions that they consider to be protected from disclosure under the  FOIA. The markings may be made at the time of submission or at a later  time. These markings will be considered by OPIC in responding to a FOIA  request but such markings (or the absence of such markings) will not be  dispositive as to whether the marked information is ultimately released.  Unless otherwise requested and approved these markings will be  considered no longer applicable ten years after submission or five years  after the close of the associated project, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When notice to submitters is required. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in  paragraph (d) of this section, OPIC's FOIA Office will use reasonable  efforts to notify a submitter in writing whenever:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The requested information has been designated in good faith by  the submitter as confidential commercial information; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> OPIC has reason to believe that the requested information may  be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This notification will describe the nature and scope of the  request, advise the submitter of its right to submit written objections  in response to the request, and provide a reasonable time for response.  The notice will either describe the commercial information requested or  include copies of the requested records. In cases involving a voluminous  number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the  notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions to submitter notice requirements. The notice  requirements of this section shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OPIC determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information lawfully has been published or has been  officially made available to the public; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other  than the   FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of  Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Opportunity to object to disclosure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The submitter may, at  any time prior to the disclosure date described in paragraph (c)(2) of  this section, submit to OPIC's FOIA Office detailed written objections  to the disclosure of the requested information, specifying the grounds  upon which it contends that the information should not be disclosed. In  setting forth such grounds, the submitter should explain the basis of  its belief that the nondisclosure of any item of information requested  is mandated or permitted by law. In the case of information that the  submitter believes to be exempt from disclosure under subsection (b)(4)  of the FOIA, the submitter shall explain why the information is  considered a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is  privileged or confidential and either: How disclosure of the information  would cause substantial competitive harm to the submitter, or why the  information should be considered voluntarily submitted and why it is  information that would not customarily be publicly released by the  submitter. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this  paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A submitter who fails to respond within the time period  specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to  disclosure of the information. Information received after the date of  any disclosure decision will not be considered. Any information provided  by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure  under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The period for providing OPIC with objections to disclosure of  information may be extended by OPIC upon receipt of a written request  for an extension from the submitter. Such written request shall set  forth the date upon which any objections are expected to be completed  and shall provide reasonable justification for the extension. In its  discretion, OPIC may permit more than one extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Analysis of objections. OPIC will consider a submitter's  objections and specific grounds for nondislosure in deciding whether to  disclose the requested information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of intent to disclose. If OPIC rejects the submitter's  objections, in whole or in part, OPIC will promptly notify the submitter  of its determination at least five working days prior to release of the  information. The notification will include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's  disclosure objections was not sustained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the information to be disclosed, or a copy  thereof; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time  subsequent to the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a FOIA  lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial  information, OPIC will promptly notify the submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Requester notification. OPIC will notify a requester whenever it  provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to  disclosure and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the  disclosure of the information.</p>
