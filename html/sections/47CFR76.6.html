                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General pleading requirements. All written submissions, both  substantive and procedural, must conform to the following standards:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A pleading must be clear, concise, and explicit. All matters  concerning a claim, defense or requested remedy, should be pleaded fully  and with specificity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pleadings must contain facts which, if true, are sufficient to  warrant a grant of the relief requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Facts must be supported by relevant documentation or affidavit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The original of all pleadings and submissions by any party shall  be signed by that party, or by the party's attorney. Complaints must be  signed by the complainant. The signing party shall state his or her  address and telephone number and the date on which the document was  signed. Copies should be conformed to the original.   Each submission must contain a written verification that the signatory  has read the submission and to the best of his or her knowledge,  information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, it is well  grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith  argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law;  and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose. If any pleading  or other submission is signed in violation of this provision, the  Commission shall upon motion or upon its own initiative impose  appropriate sanctions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Legal arguments must be supported by appropriate judicial,  Commission, or statutory authority. Opposing authorities must be  distinguished. Copies must be provided of all non-Commission authorities  relied upon which are not routinely available in national reporting  systems, such as unpublished decisions or slip opinions of courts or  administrative agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Parties are responsible for the continuing accuracy and  completeness of all information and supporting authority furnished in a  pending complaint proceeding. Information submitted, as well as relevant  legal authorities, must be current and updated as necessary and in a  timely manner at any time before a decision is rendered on the merits of  the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Frivolous pleadings. It shall be unlawful for any party to file  a frivolous pleading with the Commission. Any violation of this  paragraph shall constitute an abuse of process subject to appropriate  sanctions.
