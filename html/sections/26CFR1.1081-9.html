                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The term order of the Securities and Exchange Commission is defined in section 1083(a). In addition to the requirements specified in that definition, section 1081(f) provides that, except in the case of a distribution described in section 1081(c)(2), the provisions of section 1081 shall not apply to an exchange, expenditure, investment, distribution, or sale unless each of the following requirements is met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The order of the Securities and Exchange Commission must recite that the exchange, expenditure, investment, distribution, or sale is necessary or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of section 11(b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U. S. C. 79k (b)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The order shall specify and itemize the stocks and securities and other property (including money) which are ordered to be acquired, transferred, received, or sold upon such exchange, acquisition, expenditure, distribution, or sale and, in the case of an investment, the investment to be made, so as clearly to identify such property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The exchange, acquisition, expenditure, investment, distribution, or sale shall be made in obedience to such order and shall be completed within the time prescribed in such order.
These requirements were not designed merely to simplify the administration of the provisions of section 1081, and

they are not to be considered as pertaining only to administrative matters. Each one of the three requirements is essential and must be met if gain or loss is not to be recognized upon the transaction.</p>
