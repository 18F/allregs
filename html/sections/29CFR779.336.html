                                Sec. 779.336  Sales of building materials for commercial property
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Sales of building materials to a contractor or speculative builder  for the construction, maintenance or repair of commercial property or  any other property not excepted in section 3(n) of the Act, as explained  above, will be considered as sales for resale. (See Sec. Sec. 779.332  and 779.335.) Some employers who are dealers in building materials are  also engaged in the business of building contractors or speculative  builders. Building materials for the carrying on of the employer's  contracting or speculative building business often are supplied by the  employer himself from or through his building materials establishment.  In the analysis of the sales of the building materials establishment for  the purpose of determining the qualification of such establishment as a  ``retail or service establishment'' all transfers of stock made by the  employer from or through his building materials establishment to his  building business for the construction, maintenance or repair of  commercial property or any other property not excepted in section 3 (n)  of the Act will   be considered as sales made by such establishment for resale.</p><p class="depth0">General Tests of Exemption Under Section 13(a)(2)</p>
