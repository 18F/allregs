                            <p class="depth0">NSEPO will provide detailed comments on proposals to all applicants  who are invited to prepare a final proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Final proposals should be limited to no more than 25 double- spaced pages. Proposals will be reviewed by   national panels constructed similarly to those designed to review  preliminary proposals. In addition to a field review process, panelists  will be assembled in Washington D.C. to discuss and review the  independent and competing merits of proposals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Proposals will be evaluated in two basic categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proposals that address study abroad infrastructure and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proposals that address domestic infrastructure. Should proposals  deal with both of these issues, they will be evaluated in a third  category. This grouping of proposals will ensure that all categories of  proposals receive funding consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In general, final proposals will be considered on the following  selection criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Importance of the problem. Each proposal will be evaluated  according to the merit of how it addresses issue(s) of national  capacity. The proposal must articulate the importance of the problem it  addresses, how the proposal addresses issues of national capacity in  international education, and how it is consistent with the objectives of  the NSEP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Importance of proposed foreign language(s), foreign area(s),  field(s) or discipline(s). The proposal will be evaluated according to  how well it articulates the need for programs in the proposed areas,  languages, fields, or disciplines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identification of need and gaps/shortfalls. The proposal will be  evaluated according to its persuasiveness in identifying where the needs  exist and where serious shortfalls exist in the capacity to fill the  need. The proposal should clearly identify why these gaps exist and  provide a strong indication of familiarity with the state of the field  in the proposal area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cost effectiveness. Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of  ``educational value for the dollar.'' NSEP is interested in funding  proposals in areas where other funding is limited or in areas where NSEP  funding can significantly augment or complement other sources. NSEP is  not interested in replacing funds available from other sources or in  duplicating other efforts. Also, NSEP is interested in projects whose  dollar levels and long-range budget plans provide for realistic  continuation by the grantee institution and adaptation by other  institutions. NSEP is interested in proposed approaches to leveraging  other funds against the proposed project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Evaluation plans. Proposals will be evaluated on their approach  to measuring impact. What impact will the proposed program have on  national capacity? How will the proposed program deal with assessing  language and foreign cultural competency? In the case of study abroad  programs, how will the success and impact of study abroad experiences be  assessed. Proposals should not defer the consideration of these issues  to a latter stage of the effort. Evaluation and assessment should be an  integral part of the entire proposal effort.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Prospects for wider impact. Proposals must address national  needs and will be evaluated according to how well they are likely to  address these needs. What component of the higher education community  does the proposal address? How diverse a student population will the  proposed program address? What applications to other institutions will  be made available, either directly or indirectly, because of the  proposed program?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Capacity and commitment of the applicant. The proposal will be  evaluated according to the evidence provided on the commitment of the  institution, and other institutions, to the proposed project. What other  institutions are involved and what is their commitment? If there are  commitments from foreign institutions, what is the evidence of this  commitment? Are their plans for the institution to integrate the efforts  of the proposed program into the educational process? What plans are  there for eventual self-support? As with many other similar programs,  NSEP is particularly interested in the degree to which the institution  is willing to bear a reasonable share of the direct and indirect costs  of the proposed project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicants should also indicate if they currently receive or are  seeking support from other sources. Applicants should indicate why  support from NSEP is appropriate, if other sources are also being  sought.</p><p class="depth2">PARTS 207	209 [RESERVED]</p>
