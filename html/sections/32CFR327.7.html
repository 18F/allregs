Medical records will be disclosed to the individual to whom they pertain unless an individual fails to comply with the established requirements. This includes refusing to name a physician to receive medical records when required, refusing to pay fees, or when a judgment is made that access to such records may have an adverse effect on the mental or physical health of the individual.

The term ``civil proceeding'' is intended to include quasi-judicial and pretrial judicial proceedings. Information prepared in conjunction with the quasi-judicial, pretrial and trial proceedings to include those prepared by DeCA legal and non-legal officials of the possible consequences of a given course of action are protected from access.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Requests by DeCA personnel for access to investigatory records pertaining to themselves, compiled for law enforcement purposes, are processed under this part and that of 32 CFR part 310. Those requests by DeCA personnel for investigatory records pertaining to themselves that are in records systems exempt from access provisions shall be processed under this part or 32 CFR part 285, depending upon which provides the greatest degree of access.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Non agency records.

Any established requirement to maintain such notes (written or oral directives, regulation or command policy) make these notes ``AGENCY RECORDS.''

No notification will be provided to the requester if the action completed within the 10 days.
