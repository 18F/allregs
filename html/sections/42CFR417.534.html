They include the costs of furnishing services to the HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees, other enrollees, and nonenrolled patients, which are typical ``provider'' costs, and costs (such as marketing, enrollment, membership, and operation of the HMO or CMP) that are peculiar to health care prepayment organizations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basic rules. (1) The allowability of an HMO's or CMP's costs for furnishing services is generally determined in accordance with principles applicable to provider costs, as set forth in Sec. 417.536.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The allowability of an HMO's or CMP's costs for furnishing services is generally determined in accordance with principles applicable to provider costs, as set forth in Sec. 417.536.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The allowability of other costs is determined in accordance with principles set forth in Secs. 417.538 through 417.550.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Costs for covered services for which Medicare is not the primary payor, as described in Sec. 417.528, are not allowable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Medicare Part D program costs.
