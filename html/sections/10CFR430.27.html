                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> of this section.  In granting a waiver or interim waiver, DOE will not change the energy  use or efficiency metric that the manufacturer must use to certify  compliance with the applicable energy conservation standard and to make  representations about the energy use or efficiency of the covered  product. The granting of a waiver or interim waiver by DOE does not  exempt such basic models from any other regulatory requirement contained  in this part or the certification and compliance requirements of 10 CFR  part 429 and specifies an alternative method for testing the basic  models addressed in the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any interested person may submit a petition to waive for a  particular basic model any requirements of Sec. 430.23 or of any  appendix to this subpart, upon the grounds that the basic model contains  one or more design characteristics which either prevent testing of the  basic model according to the prescribed test procedures or cause the  prescribed test procedures to evaluate the basic model in a manner so  unrepresentative of its true energy and/or water consumption  characteristics as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manufacturers of basic model(s) subject to a waiver or interim  waiver are responsible for complying with the other requirements of this  subpart and with the requirements of 10 CFR part 429 regardless of the  person that originally submitted the petition for waiver and/or interim  waiver. The filing of a petition for waiver and/or interim waiver shall  not constitute grounds for noncompliance with any requirements of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All correspondence regarding waivers and interim waivers must be  submitted to DOE either electronically to AS--Waiver-- Requests@ee.doe.gov (preferred method of transmittal) or by mail to U.S.  Department of Energy, Building Technologies Program, Test Procedure  Waiver, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Mailstop EE-5B, Washington, DC  20585-0121.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Petition content and publication. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each petition for waiver  must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Identify the particular basic model(s) for which a waiver is  requested, each brand name under which the identified basic model(s)  will be distributed in commerce, the design characteristic(s)  constituting the grounds for the petition, and the specific requirements  sought to be waived, and must discuss in detail the need for the  requested waiver;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identify manufacturers of all other basic models distributed in  commerce in the United States and known to the petitioner to incorporate  design characteristic(s) similar to those found   in the basic model that is the subject of the petition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Include any alternate test procedures known to the petitioner  to evaluate the performance of the product type in a manner  representative of the energy and/or water consumption characteristics of  the basic model; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Be signed by the petitioner or an authorized representative. In  accordance with the provisions set forth in 10 CFR 1004.11, any request  for confidential treatment of any information contained in a petition  for waiver or in supporting documentation must be accompanied by a copy  of the petition, application or supporting documentation from which the  information claimed to be confidential has been deleted. DOE will  publish in the Federal Register the petition and supporting documents  from which confidential information, as determined by DOE, has been  deleted in accordance with 10 CFR 1004.11 and will solicit comments,  data and information with respect to the determination of the petition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each petition for interim waiver must reference the related  petition for waiver by identifying the particular basic model(s) for  which a waiver is being sought. Each petition for interim waiver must  demonstrate likely success of the petition for waiver and address what  economic hardship and/or competitive disadvantage is likely to result  absent a favorable determination on the petition for interim waiver.  Each petition for interim waiver must be signed by the petitioner or an  authorized representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Notification to other manufacturers. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each petitioner for  interim waiver must, upon publication of a grant of an interim waiver in  the Federal Register, notify in writing all known manufacturers of  domestically marketed basic models of the same product class (as  specified in 10 CFR 430.32) and of other product classes known to the  petitioner to use the technology or have the characteristic at issue in  the waiver. The notice must include a statement that DOE has published  the interim waiver and petition for waiver in the Federal Register and  the date the petition for waiver was published. The notice must also  include a statement that DOE will receive and consider timely written  comments on the petition for waiver. Within five working days, each  petitioner must file with DOE a statement certifying the names and  addresses of each person to whom a notice of the petition for waiver has  been sent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a petitioner does not request an interim waiver and  notification has not been provided pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this  section, each petitioner, after filing a petition for waiver with DOE,  and after the petition for waiver has been published in the Federal  Register, must, within five working days of such publication, notify in  writing all known manufacturers of domestically marketed units of the  same product class (as listed in 10 CFR 430.32) and of other product  classes known to the petitioner to use the technology or have the  characteristic at issue in the waiver. The notice must include a  statement that DOE has published the petition in the Federal Register  and the date the petition for waiver was published. Within five working  days of the publication of the petition in the Federal Register, each  petitioner must file with DOE a statement certifying the names and  addresses of each person to whom a notice of the petition for waiver has  been sent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Public comment and rebuttal. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any person submitting written  comments to DOE with respect to an interim waiver must also send a copy  of the comments to the petitioner by the deadline specified in the  notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any person submitting written comments to DOE with respect to a  petition for waiver must also send a copy of such comments to the  petitioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A petitioner may, within 10 working days of the close of the  comment period specified in the Federal Register, submit a rebuttal  statement to DOE. A petitioner may rebut more than one comment in a  single rebuttal statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Provisions specific to interim waivers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disposition of  application. If administratively feasible, DOE will notify the applicant  in writing of the disposition of the petition for interim waiver within  30 business days of receipt of the application. Notice of DOE's  determination on the petition   for interim waiver will be published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Criteria for granting. DOE will grant an interim waiver from the  test procedure requirements if it appears likely that the petition for  waiver will be granted and/or if DOE determines that it would be  desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a  determination on the petition for waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Provisions specific to waivers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disposition of application.  The petitioner shall be notified in writing as soon as practicable of  the disposition of each petition for waiver. DOE shall issue a decision  on the petition as soon as is practicable following receipt and review  of the Petition for Waiver and other applicable documents, including,  but not limited to, comments and rebuttal statements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Criteria for granting. DOE will grant a waiver from the test  procedure requirements if DOE determines either that the basic model(s)  for which the waiver was requested contains a design characteristic that  prevents testing of the basic model according to the prescribed test  procedures, or that the prescribed test procedures evaluate the basic  model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy or water  consumption characteristics as to provide materially inaccurate  comparative data. Waivers may be granted subject to conditions, which  may include adherence to alternate test procedures specified by DOE. DOE  will consult with the Federal Trade Commission prior to granting any  waiver, and will promptly publish in the Federal Register notice of each  waiver granted or denied, and any limiting conditions of each waiver  granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Extension to additional basic models. A petitioner may request  that DOE extend the scope of a waiver or an interim waiver to include  additional basic models employing the same technology as the basic  model(s) set forth in the original petition. DOE will publish any such  extension in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Duration. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Within one year of issuance of an interim waiver,  DOE will either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Publish in the Federal Register a determination on the petition  for waiver; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Publish in the Federal Register a new or amended test procedure  that addresses the issues presented in the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When DOE amends the test procedure to address the issues  presented in a waiver, the waiver will automatically terminate on the  date on which use of that test procedure is required to demonstrate  compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Compliance certification. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the alternate test procedure  specified in the interim waiver differs from the alternate test  procedure specified by DOE in a subsequent decision and order granting  the petition for waiver, a manufacturer who has already certified basic  models using the procedure permitted in DOE's grant of an interim test  procedure waiver is not required to re-test and re-rate those basic  models so long as: The manufacturer used that alternative procedure to  certify the compliance of the basic model after DOE granted the  company's interim waiver request; changes have not been made to those  basic models that would cause them to use more energy or otherwise be  less energy efficient; and the manufacturer does not modify the  certified rating. However, if the alternate test procedure specified in  the interim waiver differs from the alternate test procedure specified  by DOE in a subsequent decision and order granting the petition for  waiver and if specified by DOE in the decision and order, the  manufacturer must re-test and re-certify compliance using the procedure  specified by DOE in the decision and order by the time of the next  annual certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After DOE publishes a decision and order in the Federal  Register, a manufacturer must use the test procedure contained in that  notice to rate any basic models covered by the waiver that have not yet  been certified to DOE and for any future testing in support of the  certification for the basic model(s) while the waiver is valid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Petition for waiver required of other manufacturers. Within 60  days after DOE issues a waiver to a manufacturer for a product employing  a particular   technology or having a particular characteristic, any manufacturer  currently distributing in commerce in the United States a product  employing a technology or characteristic that results in the same need  for a waiver (as specified by DOE in the published decision and order on  the petition in the Federal Register) must submit a petition for waiver  pursuant to the requirements of this section. Manufacturers not  currently distributing such products in commerce in the United States  must petition for and be granted a waiver prior to distribution in  commerce in the United States. Manufacturers may also submit a request  for interim waiver pursuant to the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Rescission or modification. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> DOE may rescind or modify a  waiver or interim waiver at any time upon DOE's determination that the  factual basis underlying the petition for waiver or interim waiver is  incorrect, or upon a determination that the results from the alternate  test procedure are unrepresentative of the basic model(s)' true energy  consumption characteristics. Waivers and interim waivers are conditioned  upon the validity of statements, representations, and documents provided  by the requestor; any evidence that the original grant of a waiver or  interim waiver was based upon inaccurate information will weigh against  continuation of the waiver. DOE's decision will specify the basis for  its determination and, in the case of a modification, will also specify  the change to the authorized test procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A person may request that DOE rescind or modify a waiver or  interim waiver issued to that person if the person discovers an error in  the information provided to DOE as part of its petition, determines that  the waiver is no longer needed, or for other appropriate reasons. In a  request for rescission, the requestor must provide a statement  explaining why it is requesting rescission. In a request for  modification, the requestor must explain the need for modification to  the authorized test procedure and detail the modifications needed and  the corresponding impact on measured energy consumption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> DOE will publish a proposed rescission or modification (DOE- initiated or at the request of the original requestor) in the Federal  Register for public comment. A requestor may, within 10 working days of  the close of the comment period specified in the proposed rescission or  modification published in the Federal Register, submit a rebuttal  statement to DOE. A requestor may rebut more than one comment in a  single rebuttal statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> DOE will publish its decision in the Federal Register. DOE's  determination will be based on relevant information contained in the  record and any comments received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> After the effective date of a rescission, any basic model(s)  previously subject to a waiver must be tested and certified using the  applicable DOE test procedure in 10 CFR part 430.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Revision of regulation. As soon as practicable after the  granting of any waiver, DOE will publish in the Federal Register a  notice of proposed rulemaking to amend its regulations so as to  eliminate any need for the continuation of such waiver. As soon  thereafter as practicable, DOE will publish in the Federal Register a  final rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> To exhaust administrative remedies, any person aggrieved by an  action under this section must file an appeal with the DOE's Office of  Hearings and Appeals as provided in 10 CFR part 1003, subpart C.  [79 FR 26599, May 9, 2014]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Subpart B of Part 430--Uniform Test Method for  Measuring the Energy Consumption of Electric Refrigerators and Electric</p><p class="depth0">Refrigerator-Freezers</p><p class="depth0">Beginning on September 15, 2014, the test procedures in appendix A  must be used to determine compliance with energy conservation standards  for refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers. Prior to September 15,  2014, manufacturers may continue to use appendix A1 or may elect to use  appendix A early to show compliance with the September 15, 2014 energy  conservation standards. Manufacturers must use a single appendix for all  representations of energy use of a basic model, including certifications  of compliance, and may not use appendix A1 for certain representations  and appendix A for other representations.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Section 3, Definitions, of HRF-1-2008 (incorporated by reference;  see Sec. 430.3) applies to this test procedure.</p><p class="depth0">1.1 ``Adjusted total volume'' means the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The fresh food compartment volume as defined in HRF-1-2008  (incorporated by reference; see Sec. 430.3) in cubic feet, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The product of an adjustment factor and the net freezer  compartment volume as defined in HRF-1-2008 in cubic feet.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 ``All-refrigerator'' means an electric refrigerator that does  not include a compartment for the freezing and long time storage of food  at temperatures below 32 [deg]F (0.0 [deg]C). It may include a  compartment of 0.50 cubic-foot capacity (14.2 liters) or less for the  freezing and storage of ice.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 ``Anti-sweat heater'' means a device incorporated into the  design of a refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer to prevent the  accumulation of moisture on the exterior or interior surfaces of the  cabinet.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 ``Anti-sweat heater switch'' means a user-controllable switch or  user interface which modifies the activation or control of anti-sweat  heaters.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 ``AS/NZS 4474.1:2007'' means Australian/New Zealand Standard  4474.1:2007, Performance of household electrical appliances-- Refrigerating appliances, Part 1: Energy consumption and performance.  Only sections of AS/NZS 4474.1:2007 (incorporated by reference; see  Sec. 430.3) specifically referenced in this test procedure are part of  this test procedure. In cases where there is a conflict, the language of  the test procedure in this appendix takes precedence over AS/NZS  4474.1:2007.</p><p class="depth0">1.6 ``Automatic defrost'' means a system in which the defrost cycle  is automatically initiated and terminated, with resumption of normal  refrigeration at the conclusion of the defrost operation. The system  automatically prevents the permanent formation of frost on all  refrigerated surfaces. Nominal refrigerated food temperatures are  maintained during the operation of the automatic defrost system.</p><p class="depth0">1.7 ``Automatic icemaker'' means a device, that can be supplied with  water without user intervention, either from a pressurized water supply  system or by transfer from a water reservoir located inside the cabinet,  that automatically produces, harvests, and stores ice in a storage bin,  with means to automatically interrupt the harvesting operation when the  ice storage bin is filled to a pre-determined level.</p><p class="depth0">1.8 ``Complete temperature cycle'' means a time period defined based  upon the cycling of compartment temperature that starts when the  compartment temperature is at a maximum and ends when the compartment  temperature returns to an equivalent maximum (within 0.5 [deg]F of the  starting temperature), having in the interim fallen to a minimum and  subsequently risen again to reach the second maximum. Alternatively, a  complete temperature cycle can be defined to start when the compartment  temperature is at a minimum and end when the compartment temperature  returns to an equivalent minimum (within 0.5 [deg]F of the starting  temperature), having in the interim risen to a maximum and subsequently  fallen again to reach the second minimum.</p><p class="depth0">1.9 ``Cycle'' means the period of 24 hours for which the energy use  of an electric refrigerator or electric refrigerator-freezer is  calculated as though the consumer activated compartment temperature  controls were set to maintain the standardized temperatures (see section  3.2).</p><p class="depth0">1.10 ``Cycle type'' means the set of test conditions having the  calculated effect of operating an electric refrigerator or electric  refrigerator-freezer for a period of 24 hours, with the consumer  activated controls other than those that control compartment  temperatures set to establish various operating characteristics.</p><p class="depth0">1.11 ``Defrost cycle type'' means a distinct sequence of control  whose function is to remove frost and/or ice from a refrigerated  surface. There may be variations in the defrost control sequence such as  the number of defrost heaters energized. Each such variation establishes  a separate distinct defrost cycle type. However, defrost achieved  regularly during the compressor off-cycles by warming of the evaporator  without active heat addition, although a form of automatic defrost, does  not constitute a unique defrost cycle type for the purposes of  identifying the test period in accordance with section 4 of this  appendix.</p><p class="depth0">1.12 ``Externally vented refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer''  means an electric refrigerator or electric refrigerator-freezer that has  an enclosed condenser or an enclosed condenser/compressor compartment  and a set of air ducts for transferring the exterior air from outside  the building envelope into, through, and out of the refrigerator or  refrigerator-freezer cabinet; is capable of mixing exterior air with the  room air before discharging into, through, and out of the condenser or  condenser/compressor compartment; may include thermostatically  controlled dampers or controls that mix the exterior and room air at low  outdoor temperatures and exclude exterior air when the outdoor air  temperature is above 80 [deg]F (26.7 [deg]C) or the room air  temperature; and may have a thermostatically actuated exterior air fan.</p><p class="depth0">1.13 ``HRF-1-2008'' means AHAM Standard HRF-1-2008, Association of  Home Appliance Manufacturers, Energy and Internal Volume of  Refrigerating Appliances (2008), including Errata to Energy and Internal  Volume of Refrigerating Appliances, Correction Sheet   issued November 17, 2009. Only sections of HRF-1-2008 (incorporated by  reference; see Sec. 430.3) specifically referenced in this test  procedure are part of this test procedure. In cases where there is a  conflict, the language of the test procedure in this appendix takes  precedence over HRF-1-2008.</p><p class="depth0">1.14 ``Ice storage bin'' means a container in which ice can be  stored.</p><p class="depth0">1.15 ``Long-time automatic defrost'' means an automatic defrost  system whose successive defrost cycles are separated by 14 hours or more  of compressor operating time.</p><p class="depth0">1.16 ``Multiple-compressor'' refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer  means a refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer with more than one  compressor.</p><p class="depth0">1.17 ``Precooling'' means operating a refrigeration system before  initiation of a defrost cycle to reduce one or more compartment  temperatures significantly (more than 0.5 [deg]F) below its minimum  during stable operation between defrosts.</p><p class="depth0">1.18 ``Recovery'' means operating a refrigeration system after the  conclusion of a defrost cycle to reduce the temperature of one or more  compartments to the temperature range that the compartment(s) exhibited  during stable operation between defrosts.</p><p class="depth0">1.19 ``Separate auxiliary compartment'' means a freezer compartment  or a fresh food compartment of a refrigerator or refrigerator-freezer  having more than two compartments that is not the first freezer  compartment or the first fresh food compartment. Access to a separate  auxiliary compartment is through a separate exterior door or doors  rather than through the door or doors of another compartment. Separate  auxiliary compartments may be convertible (e.g., from fresh food to  freezer). Separate auxiliary freezer compartments may not be larger than  the first freezer compartment and separate auxiliary fresh food  compartments may not be larger than the first fresh food compartment,  but such size restrictions do not apply to separate auxiliary  convertible compartments.</p><p class="depth0">1.20 ``Special compartment'' means any compartment other than a  butter conditioner, without doors directly accessible from the exterior,  and with separate temperature control (such as crispers convertible to  meat keepers) that is not convertible from fresh food temperature range  to freezer temperature range.</p><p class="depth0">1.21 ``Stabilization period'' means the total period of time during  which steady-state conditions are being attained or evaluated.</p><p class="depth0">1.22 ``Stable operation'' means operation after steady-state  conditions have been achieved but excluding any events associated with  defrost cycles. During stable operation the average rate of change of  compartment temperature must not exceed 0.042 [deg]F (0.023 [deg]C) per  hour for all compartment temperatures. Such a calculation performed for  compartment temperatures at any two times, or for any two periods of  time comprising complete cycles, during stable operation must meet this  requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If compartment temperatures do not cycle, the relevant  calculation shall be the difference between the temperatures at two  points in time divided by the difference, in hours, between those points  in time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If compartment temperatures cycle as a result of compressor  cycling or other cycling operation of any system component (e.g., a  damper, fan, or heater), the relevant calculation shall be the  difference between compartment temperature averages evaluated for whole  compressor cycles or complete temperature cycles divided by the  difference, in hours, between either the starts, ends, or mid-times of  the two cycles.</p><p class="depth0">1.23 ``Standard cycle'' means the cycle type in which the anti-sweat  heater control, when provided, is set in the highest energy-consuming  position.</p><p class="depth0">1.24 ``Through-the-door ice/water dispenser'' means a device  incorporated within the cabinet, but outside the boundary of the  refrigerated space, that delivers to the user on demand ice and may also  deliver water from within the refrigerated space without opening an  exterior door. This definition includes dispensers that are capable of  dispensing ice and water or ice only.</p><p class="depth0">1.25 ``Variable anti-sweat heater control'' means an anti-sweat  heater control that varies the average power input of the anti-sweat  heater(s) based on operating condition variable(s) and/or ambient  condition variable(s).</p><p class="depth0">1.26 ``Variable defrost control'' means an automatic defrost system  in which successive defrost cycles are determined by an operating  condition variable or variables other than solely compressor operating  time. This includes any electrical or mechanical device performing this  function. A control scheme that changes the defrost interval from a  fixed length to an extended length (without any intermediate steps) is  not considered a variable defrost control. A variable defrost control  feature should predict the accumulation of frost on the evaporator and  react accordingly. Therefore, the times between defrost should vary with  different usage patterns and include a continuum of lengths of time  between defrosts as inputs vary.</p><p class="depth0">2. Test Conditions</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Ambient Temperature Measurement. Temperature measuring devices  shall be shielded so that indicated temperatures are not affected by the  operation of the condensing unit or adjacent units.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.1 Ambient Temperature. The ambient temperature shall be recorded  at points located 3 feet (91.5 cm) above the floor and 10 inches (25.4  cm) from the center of the two sides of the unit under test. The ambient  temperature shall be 90.0  1.0 [deg]F (32.2  0.6 [deg]C)   during the stabilization period and the test period.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2 Ambient Temperature Gradient. The test room vertical ambient  temperature gradient in any foot of vertical distance from 2 inches (5.1  cm) above the floor or supporting platform to a height of 1 foot (30.5  cm) above the top of the unit under test is not to exceed 0.5 [deg]F per  foot (0.9 [deg]C per meter). The vertical ambient temperature gradient  at locations 10 inches (25.4 cm) out from the centers of the two sides  of the unit being tested is to be maintained during the test. To  demonstrate that this requirement has been met, test data must include  measurements taken using temperature sensors at locations 10 inches  (25.4 cm) from the center of the two sides of the unit under test at  heights of 2 inches (5.1 cm) and 36 inches (91.4 cm) above the floor or  supporting platform and at a height of 1 foot (30.5 cm) above the unit  under test.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3 Platform. A platform must be used if the floor temperature is  not within 3 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) of the measured ambient temperature. If  a platform is used, it is to have a solid top with all sides open for  air circulation underneath, and its top shall extend at least 1 foot  (30.5 cm) beyond each side and front of the unit under test and extend  to the wall in the rear.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Operational Conditions. The unit under test shall be installed  and its operating conditions maintained in accordance with HRF-1-2008  (incorporated by reference; see Sec. 430.3), sections 5.3.2 through  section 5.5.5.5 (excluding section 5.5.5.4). Exceptions and  clarifications to the cited sections of HRF-1-2008 are noted in sections  2.3 through 2.8, and 5.1 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Anti-Sweat Heaters. The anti-sweat heater switch is to be on  during one test and off during a second test. In the case of an electric  refrigerator-freezer equipped with variable anti-sweat heater control,  the standard cycle energy use shall be the result of the calculation  described in 6.2.3.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Conditions for Automatic Defrost Refrigerator-Freezers. For  automatic defrost refrigerator-freezers, the freezer compartments shall  not be loaded with any frozen food packages during testing. Cylindrical  metallic masses of dimensions 1.12 0.25 inches  (2.9 0.6 cm) in diameter and height shall be  attached in good thermal contact with each temperature sensor within the  refrigerated compartments. All temperature measuring sensor masses shall  be supported by low-thermal-conductivity supports in such a manner to  ensure that there will be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of air space  separating the thermal mass from contact with any interior surface or  hardware inside the cabinet. In case of interference with hardware at  the sensor locations specified in section 5.1, the sensors shall be  placed at the nearest adjacent location such that there will be a 1-inch  air space separating the sensor mass from the hardware.</p><p class="depth0">2.5 Conditions for All-Refrigerators. There shall be no load in the  freezer compartment during the test.</p><p class="depth0">2.6 The cabinet and its refrigerating mechanism shall be assembled  and set up in accordance with the printed consumer instructions supplied  with the cabinet.

For the  special case of convertible separate auxiliary compartments, this means  that the compartment shall be treated as a freezer compartment or a  fresh food compartment, depending on which of these represents higher  energy use. Special compartments shall be tested with controls set to  provide the coldest temperature. However, for special compartments in  which temperature control is achieved using the addition of heat  (including resistive electric heating, refrigeration system waste heat,  or heat from any other source, but excluding the transfer of air from  another part of the interior of the product) for any part of the  controllable temperature range of that compartment, the product energy  use shall be determined by averaging two sets of tests. The first set of  tests shall be conducted with such special compartments at their coldest  settings, and the second set of tests shall be conducted with such   special compartments at their warmest settings. The requirements for the  warmest or coldest temperature settings of this section do not apply to  features or functions associated with temperature control (such as fast  chill compartments) that are initiated manually and terminated  automatically within 168 hours.</p><p class="depth0">2.8 Rear Clearance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General.

An exterior air source shall be provided with  adjustable temperature and pressure capabilities. The exterior air  temperature shall be adjustable from 30 1 [deg]F  (1.7 0.6 [deg]C) to 90 1  [deg]F (32.2 0.6 [deg]C).</p><p class="depth0">2.10.1 Air Duct.

The air temperature entering the  condenser or condenser/compressor compartment shall be maintained to  3 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) during the stabilization and  test periods and shall be measured at the inlet point of the condenser  or condenser/compressor compartment (``condenser inlet''). Temperature  measurements shall be taken from at least three temperature sensors or  one sensor per 4 square inches (25.8 square cm) of the air duct cross- sectional area, whichever is greater, and shall be averaged. For a unit  that has a condenser air fan, a minimum of three temperature sensors at  the condenser fan discharge shall be required. Temperature sensors shall  be arranged to be at the centers of equally divided cross-sectional  areas.

Test Control Settings</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Model with no User Operable Temperature Control. A test shall be  performed to measure the compartment temperatures and energy use. A  second test shall be performed with the temperature control electrically  short circuited to cause the compressor to run continuously.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Models with User Operable Temperature Control.

For electronic control  systems, the test shall be performed with all compartment temperature  controls set at the average of the coldest and warmest settings; if  there is no setting equal to this average, the setting closest to the  average shall be used. If there are two such settings equally close to  the average, the higher of these temperature control settings shall be  used. A second test shall be performed with all controls set at their  warmest setting or all controls set at their coldest setting (not  electrically or mechanically bypassed). For all-refrigerators, this  setting shall be the appropriate setting that attempts to achieve  compartment temperatures measured during the two tests that bound (i.e.,  one is above and one is below) the standardized temperature for all- refrigerators. For refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, the second  test shall be conducted with all controls at their coldest setting,  unless all compartment temperatures measured during the first part of  the test are lower than the standardized temperatures, in which case the  second test shall be conducted with all controls at their warmest  setting. Refer to Table 1 of this appendix for all-refrigerators or  Table 2 of this appendix for refrigerators with freezer compartments and  refrigerator-freezers to determine which test results to use in the  energy consumption calculation.

For separate auxiliary convertible compartments tested as  freezer compartments, the median setting shall be within 2 [deg]F (1.1  [deg]C) of the standardized temperature, and the warmest setting shall  be above 5 [deg]F (-15 [deg]C). For separate auxiliary convertible  compartments tested as fresh food compartments, the median setting shall  be within 2 [deg]F (1.1 [deg]C) of the standardized temperature, and the  coldest setting shall be below 34 [deg]F (1.1 [deg]C).

As an alternative to section 3.2, perform three tests such  that the set of tests meets the ``minimum requirements for  interpolation'' of AS/NZS 4474.1:2007 (incorporated by reference; see  Sec. 430.3) appendix M, section M3, paragraphs (a) through (c) and as  illustrated in Figure M1. The target temperatures txA and  txB defined in section M4(a)(i) of AS/NZ 4474.1:2007 shall be  the standardized temperatures defined in section 3.2 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">4. Test Period</p><p class="depth0">Tests shall be performed by establishing the conditions set forth in  section 2, and using the control settings set forth in section 3.</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Non-automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has no  automatic defrost system, the test period shall start after steady-state  conditions (see section 2.9 of this appendix) have been achieved and be  no less than three hours in duration. During the test period, the  compressor motor shall complete two or more whole compressor cycles. (A  compressor cycle is a complete ``on'' and a complete ``off'' period of  the motor.) If no ``off'' cycling occurs, the test period shall be three  hours. If fewer than two compressor cycles occur during a 24-hour  period, then a single complete compressor cycle may be used.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has an automatic  defrost system, the test period shall start after steady-state  conditions have been achieved and be from one point during a defrost  period to the same point during the next defrost period. If the model  being tested has a long-time automatic defrost system, the alternative  provisions of section 4.2.1 may be used. If the model being tested has a  variable defrost control, the provisions of section 4.2.2 shall apply.  If the model is a multiple-compressor product with automatic defrost,  the provisions of section 4.2.3 shall apply. If the model being tested  has long-time automatic or variable defrost control involving multiple  defrost cycle types, such as for a product with a single compressor and  two or more evaporators in which the evaporators are defrosted at  different frequencies, the provisions of section 4.2.4 shall apply. If  the model being tested has multiple defrost cycle types for which  compressor run time between defrosts is a fixed time of less than 14  hours for all such cycle types, and for which the compressor run times  between defrosts for different defrost cycle types are equal to or  multiples of each other, the test period shall be from one point of the  defrost cycle type with the longest compressor run time between defrosts  to the same point during the next occurrence of this defrost cycle type.  For such products not using the procedures   of section 4.2.4, energy consumption shall be calculated as described in  section 5.2.1.1 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1 Long-time Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has a  long-time automatic defrost system, the two-part test described in this  section may be used. The first part is a stable period of compressor  operation that includes no portions of the defrost cycle, such as  precooling or recovery, that is otherwise the same as the test for a  unit having no defrost provisions (section 4.1). The second part is  designed to capture the energy consumed during all of the events  occurring with the defrost control sequence that are outside of stable  operation.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1.1 Cycling Compressor System. For a system with a cycling  compressor, the second part of the test starts at the termination of the  last regular compressor ``on'' cycle. The average temperatures of the  fresh food and freezer compartments measured from the termination of the  previous compressor ``on'' cycle to the termination of the last regular  compressor ``on'' cycle must both be within 0.5 [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C) of  their average temperatures measured for the first part of the test. If  any compressor cycles occur prior to the defrost heater being energized  that cause the average temperature in either compartment to deviate from  its average temperature for the first part of the test by more than 0.5  [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C), these compressor cycles are not considered regular  compressor cycles and must be included in the second part of the test.  As an example, a ``precooling'' cycle, which is an extended compressor  cycle that lowers the temperature(s) of one or both compartments prior  to energizing the defrost heater, must be included in the second part of  the test. The test period for the second part of the test ends at the  termination of the first regular compressor ``on'' cycle after both  compartment temperatures have fully recovered to their stable  conditions. The average temperatures of the compartments measured from  this termination of the first regular compressor ``on'' cycle until the  termination of the next regular compressor ``on'' cycle must both be  within 0.5 [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C) of their average temperatures measured  for the first part of the test. See Figure 1. Note that Figure 1  illustrates the concepts of precooling and recovery but does not  represent all possible defrost cycles.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1.2 Non-cycling Compressor System. For a system with a non- cycling compressor, the second part of the test starts at a time before  defrost during stable operation when the temperatures of both fresh food  and freezer compartments are within 0.5 [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C) of their  average temperatures measured for the first part of the test. The second  part stops at a time after defrost during stable operation when the  temperatures of both compartments are within 0.5 [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C) of  their average temperatures measured for the first part of the test. See  Figure 2.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25JA12.005</p><p class="depth0">4.2.2 Variable Defrost Control. If the model being tested has a  variable defrost control system, the test shall consist of the same two  parts as the test for long-time automatic defrost (section 4.2.1).</p><p class="depth0">4.2.3 Multiple-compressor Products with Automatic Defrost.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.3.1 Measurement Frequency. Measurements of power input,  cumulative electric energy consumption (watt-hours or kilowatt-hours),  and compartment temperature shall be taken at regular intervals not  exceeding one minute.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.3.2 Steady-state Condition. Steady state shall be considered to  have been attained after 24 hours of operation after the last adjustment  of the temperature controls.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.3.3 Primary Compressor. If at least one compressor cycles, test  periods shall be based on compressor cycles associated with the primary  compressor system (these are referred to as ``primary compressor  cycles''). If the freezer compressor cycles, it shall be the primary  compressor system.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.3.4 Test Periods. The two-part test described in this section  shall be used. The first part is a stable continuous period of  compressor operation that includes no defrost cycles or events  associated with a defrost cycle, such as precooling or recovery, for any  compressor system. The second part is a continuous test period designed  to capture the energy consumed during all of the events occurring with  the defrost control sequence that are outside of stable operation. The  second part of the test shall be conducted separately for each automatic  defrost system present.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.3.4.1 First Part of Test. If at least one compressor cycles, the  test period for the first part of the test shall include a whole number  of complete primary compressor cycles comprising at least 24 hours of  stable operation, unless a defrost occurs prior to completion of 24  hours of stable operation, in   which case the first part of the test shall include a whole number of  complete primary compressor cycles comprising at least 18 hours of  stable operation. If no compressor cycles, the first part of the test  shall comprise at least 24 hours of stable operation, unless a defrost  occurs prior to completion of 24 hours of stable operation, in which  case the first part of the test shall comprise at least 18 hours of  stable operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If at least one compressor  cycles, the test period for the second part of the test starts during  stable operation before all portions of the defrost cycle, at the  beginning of a complete primary compressor cycle. The test period for  the second part of the test ends during stable operation after all  portions of the defrost cycle, including recovery, at the termination of  a complete primary compressor cycle. The start and stop for the test  period shall both occur either when the primary compressor starts or  when the primary compressor stops. For each compressor system, the  compartment temperature averages for the first and last complete  compressor cycles that lie completely within the second part of the test  must be within 0.5 [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C) of the average compartment  temperature measured for the first part of the test. If any one of the  compressor systems is non-cycling, its compartment temperature averages  during the first and last complete primary compressor cycles of the  second part of the test must be within 0.5 [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C) of the  average compartment temperature measured for the first part of the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If no compressor cycles, the test period for the second part of  the test starts during stable operation before all portions of the  defrost cycle, when the compartment temperatures of all compressor  systems are within 0.5 [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C) of their average temperatures  measured for the first part of the test. The test period for the second  part ends during stable operation after all portions of the defrost  cycle, including recovery, when the compartment temperatures of all  compressor systems are within 0.5 [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C) of their average  temperatures measured for the first part of the test.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.4 Systems with Multiple Defrost Frequencies. This section  applies to models with long-time automatic or variable defrost control  with multiple defrost cycle types, such as models with single  compressors and multiple evaporators in which the evaporators have  different defrost frequencies. The two-part method in 4.2.1 shall be  used. The second part of the method will be conducted separately for  each distinct defrost cycle type.</p><p class="depth0">5. Test Measurements</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Temperature measurements shall be  made at the locations prescribed in Figures 5.1 and 5.2 of HRF-1-2008  (incorporated by reference; see Sec. 430.3) and shall be accurate to  within 0.5 [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C). No freezer  temperature measurements need be taken in an all-refrigerator model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the interior arrangements of the unit under test do not  conform with those shown in Figure 5.1 and 5.2 of HRF-1-2008, the unit  must be tested by relocating the temperature sensors from the locations  specified in the figures to avoid interference with hardware or  components within the unit, in which case the specific locations used  for the temperature sensors shall be noted in the test data records  maintained by the manufacturer in accordance with 10 CFR 429.71, and the  certification report shall indicate that non-standard sensor locations  were used. If any temperature sensor is relocated by any amount from the  location prescribed in Figure 5.1 or 5.2 of HRF-1-2008 in order to  maintain a minimum 1-inch air space from adjustable shelves or other  components that could be relocated by the consumer, this constitutes a  relocation of temperature sensors that shall be recorded in the test  data and reported in the certification report as described above.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1 Measured Temperature. The measured temperature of a  compartment is the average of all sensor temperature readings taken in  that compartment at a particular point in time.

The compartment temperature for each  test period shall be an average of the measured temperatures taken in a  compartment during the test period as defined in section 4 of this  appendix. For long-time automatic defrost models, compartment  temperatures shall be those measured in the first part of the test  period specified in section 4.2.1 of this appendix. For models with  variable defrost controls, compartment temperatures shall be those  measured in the first part of the test period specified in section 4.2.2  of this appendix. For models with automatic defrost that is neither  long-time nor variable defrost, the compartment temperature shall be an  average of the measured temperatures taken in a compartment during a  stable period of compressor operation that (a) includes no defrost  cycles or events associated with a defrost cycle, such as precooling or  recovery, (b) is no less than three hours in duration, and (c) includes  two or more whole compressor cycles.

Access to a separate  auxiliary compartment is through a separate exterior door or doors  rather than through the door or doors of another compartment. Separate  auxiliary compartments may be convertible (e.g., from fresh food to  freezer). Separate auxiliary freezer compartments may not be larger than  the first freezer compartment and separate auxiliary fresh food  compartments may not be larger than the first fresh food compartment,  but such size restrictions do not apply to separate auxiliary  convertible compartments.</p><p class="depth0">1.14 ``Special compartment'' means any compartment other than a  butter conditioner, without doors directly accessible from the exterior,  and with separate temperature control (such as crispers convertible to  meat keepers) that is not convertible from fresh food temperature range  to freezer temperature range.</p><p class="depth0">1.15 ``Stabilization Period'' means the total period of time during  which steady-state conditions are being attained or evaluated.</p><p class="depth0">1.16 ``Standard cycle'' means the cycle type in which the anti-sweat  heater control, when provided, is set in the highest energy consuming  position.</p><p class="depth0">1.17 ``Variable anti-sweat heater control'' means an anti-sweat  heater control that varies the average power input of the anti-sweat  heater(s) based on operating condition variable(s) and/or ambient  condition variable(s).</p><p class="depth0">1.18 ``Variable defrost control'' means an automatic defrost system  in which successive defrost cycles are determined by an operating  condition variable or variables other than solely compressor operating  time. This includes any electrical or mechanical device performing this  function. A control scheme that changes the defrost interval from a  fixed length to an extended length (without any intermediate steps) is  not considered a variable defrost control. A variable defrost control  feature should predict the accumulation of frost on the evaporator and  react accordingly. Therefore, the times between defrost should vary with  different usage patterns and include a continuum of lengths of time  between defrosts as inputs vary.</p><p class="depth0">2.

For mechanical control systems, knob  detents shall be mechanically defeated if necessary to attain a median  setting. For electronic control systems, the test shall be performed  with all compartment temperature controls set at the average of the  coldest and warmest settings--if there is no setting equal to this  average, the setting closest to the average shall be used. If there are  two such settings equally close to the average, the higher of these  temperature control settings shall be used. A second test shall be  performed with all controls set at their warmest setting or all controls  set at their coldest setting (not   electrically or mechanically bypassed).

If (b) the measured  temperatures of all compartments with all controls set at their warmest  settings are below their standardized temperatures then the result of  this test alone will be used to determine energy consumption. If neither  (a) nor (b) occur, then the results of the first two tests shall be used  to determine energy consumption.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.2 Alternatively, a first test may be performed with all  temperature controls set at their warmest setting.

If no ``off'' cycling will occur,  as determined during the stabilization period, the test period shall be  3 hours. If incomplete cycling occurs (i.e. less than two compressor  cycles during a 24-hour period), the results of the 24-hour period shall  be used.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has an automatic  defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady-state  conditions have been achieved and be from one point during a defrost  period to the same point during the next defrost period.

The clearance shall not be greater than 2  inches (51 mm) from the lowest edge of the rear plane to the vertical  surface, unless the provisions of subsection (c) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If permanent rear spacers or other components that protrude  beyond the rear plane extend further than the 2 inch (51 mm) distance,  or if the highest edge of the rear plane is in contact with the vertical  surface when the unit is positioned with the lowest edge of the rear  plane at or further than the 2 inch (51 mm) distance from the vertical  surface, the appliance shall be located with the spacers or other  components protruding beyond the rear plane, or the highest edge of the  rear plane, in contact with the vertical surface.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rear-mounted condensers. If the product has a flat rear-wall- mounted condenser (i.e., a rear-wall-mounted condenser with all  refrigerant tube centerlines within 0.25 inches (6.4 mm) of the  condenser plane), and the area of the condenser plane represents at  least 25% of the total area of the rear wall of the cabinet, then the  spacing to the vertical surface may be measured from the lowest edge of  the condenser plane.</p><p class="depth0">2.7 Steady State Condition. Steady-state conditions exist if the  temperature measurements taken at 4-minute intervals or less during a  stabilization period are not changing at a rate greater than 0.042  [deg]F (0.023 [deg]C) per hour as determined by the applicable condition  of A or B described below.</p><p class="depth0">A--The average of the measurements during a 2-hour period if no  cycling occurs or during a number of complete repetitive compressor  cycles occurring through a period of no less than 2 hours is compared to  the average over an equivalent time period with 3 hours elapsing between  the two measurement periods.</p><p class="depth0">B--If A above cannot be used, the average of the measurements during  a number of complete repetitive compressor cycles occurring through a  period of no less than 2 hours   and including the last complete cycle before a defrost period (or if no  cycling occurs, the average of the measurements during the last 2 hours  before a defrost period) are compared to the same averaging period  before the following defrost period.</p><p class="depth0">2.8 Freezers with Demand-Response Capability. Freezers that have a  communication module for demand-response functions that is located  within the cabinet shall be tested with the communication module in the  configuration set at the factory just before shipping.</p><p class="depth0">2.9 For products that require the freezer compartment to be loaded  with packages in accordance with section 5.5.5.3 of HRF-1-2008, the  number of packages comprising the 75% load shall be determined by  filling the compartment completely with the packages that are to be used  for the test, such that the packages fill as much of the usable  refrigerated space within the compartment as is physically possible, and  then removing from the compartment a number of packages so that the  compartment contains 75% of the packages that were placed in the  compartment to completely fill it. If multiplying the total number of  packages by 0.75 results in a fraction, the number of packages used  shall be rounded to the nearest whole number, rounding up if the result  ends in 0.5. For multi-shelf units, this method shall be applied to each  shelf. For both single- and multi-shelf units, the remaining packages  shall be arranged as necessary to provide the required air gap and  thermocouple placement. The number of packages comprising the 100% and  75% loading conditions shall be recorded in the test data maintained in  accordance with 10 CFR 429.71.</p><p class="depth0">3. Test Control Settings</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Model with No User Operable Temperature Control. A test shall be  performed during which the compartment temperature and energy use shall  be measured. A second test shall be performed with the temperature  control electrically short circuited to cause the compressor to run  continuously. If the model has the quick freeze option, this option must  be used to bypass the temperature control.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Model with User Operable Temperature Control. Testing shall be  performed in accordance with one of the following sections using the  standardized temperature of 0.0 [deg]F (-17.8 [deg]C).  For the purposes of comparing compartment temperatures with standardized  temperatures, as described in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, the freezer  compartment temperature shall be as specified in section 5.1.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> knob detents shall be  mechanically defeated if necessary to attain a median setting, and (b)  the warmest and coldest settings shall correspond to the positions in  which the indicator is aligned with control symbols indicating the  warmest and coldest settings. For electronic control systems, the test  shall be performed with all compartment temperature controls set at the  average of the coldest and warmest settings; if there is no setting  equal to this average, the setting closest to the average shall be used.  If there are two such settings equally close to the average, the higher  of these temperature control settings shall be used. A second test shall  be performed with all controls set at either their warmest or their  coldest setting (not electrically or mechanically bypassed), whichever  is appropriate, to attempt to achieve compartment temperatures measured  during the two tests that bound (i.e., one is above and one is below)  the standardized temperature. If the compartment temperatures measured  during these two tests bound the standardized temperature, then these  test results shall be used to determine energy consumption. If the  compartment temperature measured with all controls set at their coldest  setting is above the standardized temperature, the tested unit fails the  test and cannot be rated. If the compartment temperature measured with  all controls set at their warmest setting is below the standardized  temperature, then the result of this test alone will be used to  determine energy consumption.

If the compartment  temperature is below the standardized temperature, then the result of  this test alone will be used to determine energy consumption. If this  condition is not met, then the unit shall be tested in accordance with  section 3.2.1.</p><p class="depth0">4. Test Period</p><p class="depth0">Tests shall be performed by establishing the conditions set forth in  section 2 and using the control settings as set forth in section 3  above.</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Non-automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has no  automatic defrost system, the test period shall start after steady-state  conditions (see section 2.7 of this appendix) have been achieved and be  no less than three hours in duration. During the test period, the  compressor motor shall complete two or more whole compressor cycles. (A  whole compressor cycle is a complete ``on'' and a complete ``off''  period of the motor.) If no ``off'' cycling occurs, the test period  shall be three hours. If less than two compressor cycles occur during a  24-hour period, then a single complete compressor cycle may be used.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has an automatic  defrost system, the test time period shall start after steady-state  conditions have been achieved and be from one point during a defrost  period to the same point during the next defrost period. If the model  being tested has a long-time automatic defrost system, the alternate  provisions of 4.2.1 may be used. If the model being tested has a  variable defrost control, the provisions of 4.2.2 shall apply.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1 Long-time Automatic Defrost. If the model being tested has a  long-time automatic defrost system, the two-part test described in this  section may be used. The first part is a stable period of compressor  operation that includes no portions of the defrost cycle, such as  precooling or recovery, that is otherwise the same as the test for a  unit having no defrost provisions (section 4.1). The second part is  designed to capture the energy consumed during all of the events  occurring with the defrost control sequence that are outside of stable  operation.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1.1 Cycling Compressor System. For a system with a cycling  compressor, the second part of the test starts at the termination of the  last regular compressor ``on'' cycle. The average temperature of the  compartment measured from the termination of the previous compressor  ``on'' cycle to the termination of the last regular compressor ``on''  cycle must be within 0.5 [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C) of the average temperature  of the compartment measured for the first part of the test. If any  compressor cycles occur prior to the defrost heater being energized that  cause the average temperature in the compartment to deviate from the  average temperature for the first part of the test by more than 0.5  [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C), these compressor cycles are not considered regular  compressor cycles and must be included in the second part of the test.  As an example, a ``precooling'' cycle, which is an extended compressor  cycle that lowers the compartment temperature prior to energizing the  defrost heater, must be included in the second part of the test. The  test period for the second part of the test ends at the termination of  the first regular compressor ``on'' cycle after the compartment  temperatures have fully recovered to their stable conditions. The  average temperature of the compartment measured from this termination of  the first regular compressor ``on'' cycle until the termination of the  next regular compressor ``on'' cycle must be within 0.5 [deg]F (0.3  [deg]C) of the average temperature of the compartment measured for the  first part of the test. See Figure 1. Note that Figure 1 illustrates the  concepts of precooling and recovery but does not represent all possible  defrost cycles.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25JA12.007</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1.2 Non-cycling Compressor System. For a system with a non- cycling compressor, the second part of the test starts at a time before  defrost during stable operation when the compartment temperature is  within 0.5 [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C) of the average temperature of the  compartment measured for the first part of the test. The second part  stops at a time after defrost during stable operation when the  compartment temperature is within 0.5 [deg]F (0.3 [deg]C) of the average  temperature of the compartment measured for the first part of the test.  See Figure 2.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25JA12.008</p><p class="depth0">4.2.2 Variable Defrost Control. If the model being tested has a  variable defrost control system, the test shall consist of the same two  parts as the test for long-time automatic defrost (section 4.2.1).</p><p class="depth0">5.

If any temperature sensor is relocated by any amount from the  location prescribed in Figure 5.2 of HRF-1-2008 in order to maintain a  minimum 1-inch air space from adjustable shelves or other components  that could be relocated by the consumer, this constitutes a relocation  of temperature sensors that shall be recorded in the test data and  reported in the certification report as described above.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1 Measured Temperature.

The compartment temperature for each  test period shall be an average of the measured temperatures taken in a  compartment during the test period as defined in section 4 of this  appendix. For long-time automatic defrost models, compartment  temperature shall be that measured in the first part of   the test period specified in section 4.2.1 of this appendix. For models  with variable defrost controls, compartment temperature shall be that  measured in the first part of the test period specified in section 4.2.2  of this appendix. For models with automatic defrost that is neither  long-time nor variable defrost, the compartment temperature shall be an  average of the measured temperatures taken in a compartment during a  stable period of compressor operation that (a) includes no defrost  cycles or events associated with a defrost cycle, such as precooling or  recovery, (b) is no less than three hours in duration, and (c) includes  two or more whole compressor cycles.

If the power level does not change by  more than 5 percent from the maximum observed value during the later 5  minutes and there is no cyclic or pulsing behavior of the load, the load  can be considered stable. For stable operation, standby power,  Sm, can be recorded directly from the standby watt meter in  watts or accumulated using the standby watt-hour meter over a period of  at least 5 minutes. For unstable operation, the energy must be  accumulated using the standby watt-hour meter over a period of at least  5 minutes and must capture the energy use over one or more complete  cycles.

Measure the drum capacity by sealing all openings  in the drum except the loading port with a plastic bag, and ensure that  all corners and depressions are filled and that there are no extrusions  of the plastic bag through any openings in the interior of the drum.  Support the dryer's rear drum surface on a platform scale to prevent  deflection of the dryer, and record the weight of the empty dryer. Fill  the drum with water to a level determined by the intersection of the  door plane and the loading port (i.e., the uppermost edge of the drum  that is in contact with the door seal). Record the temperature of the  water and then the weight of the dryer with the added water and then  determine the mass of the water in pounds. Add the appropriate volume to  account for any space in the drum interior not measured by water fill  (e.g., the space above the uppermost edge of the drum within a curved  door) and subtract the appropriate volume to account for space that is  measured by water fill but cannot be used when the door is closed (e.g.,  space occupied by the door when closed). The drum capacity is calculated  as follows: C = w/d volume adjustment C = capacity in cubic feet. w = mass of water in pounds. d = density of water at the measured temperature in pounds per cubic</p><p class="depth0">foot.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Dryer loading.

For timer dryers, as defined in section 1.20 of  this appendix, operate the clothes dryer at the maximum temperature  setting and, if equipped with a timer, at the maximum time setting. Any  other optional cycle settings that do not affect the temperature or time  settings shall be tested in the as-shipped position. If the clothes  dryer does not have a separate temperature setting selection on the  control panel, the maximum time setting should be used for the drying  test cycle. Dry the load until the moisture content of the test load is  between 1 and 2.5 percent of the bone-dry weight of the test load, at  which point the test cycle is stopped, but do not permit the dryer to  advance into cool down. If required, reset the timer to increase the  length of the drying cycle. After stopping the test cycle, remove and  weigh the test load. The clothes dryer shall not be stopped  intermittently in the middle of the test cycle for any reason. Record  the data specified by section 3.4 of this appendix. If the dryer  automatically stops during a cycle because the condensation box is full  of water, the test is stopped, and the test run is invalid, in which  case the condensation box shall be emptied and the test re-run from the  beginning. For ventless dryers, as defined in section 1.21 of this  appendix, during the time between two cycles, the door of the dryer  shall be closed except for loading (and unloading).</p><p class="depth0">3.3.2 Automatic termination control dryers. For automatic  termination control dryers, as defined in section 1.5 of this appendix,  a ``normal'' program shall be selected for the test cycle. For dryers  that do not have a ``normal'' program, the cycle recommended by the  manufacturer for drying cotton or linen clothes shall be selected. Where  the drying temperature setting can be chosen independently of the  program, it shall be set to the maximum. Where the dryness level setting  can be chosen independently of the program, it shall be set to the  ``normal'' or ``medium'' dryness level setting. If such designation is  not provided, then the dryness level shall be set at the mid-point  between the minimum and maximum settings. Any other optional cycle  settings that do not affect the program, temperature or dryness settings  shall be tested in the as-shipped position. Operate the clothes dryer  until the completion of the programmed cycle, including the cool down  period. The cycle shall be considered complete when the dryer indicates  to the user that the cycle has finished (by means of a display,  indicator light, audible signal, or other signal) and the heater and  drum/fan motor shuts off for the final time. If the clothes dryer is  equipped with a wrinkle prevention mode (i.e., that continuously or  intermittently tumbles the clothes dryer drum after the clothes dryer  indicates to the user that the cycle has finished) that is activated by  default in the as-shipped position or if manufacturers' instructions  specify that the feature is recommended to be activated for normal use,  the cycle shall be considered complete after the end of the wrinkle  prevention mode. After the completion of   the test cycle, remove and weigh the test load. Record the data  specified in section 3.4 of this appendix. If the final moisture content  is greater than 2 percent, the test shall be invalid and a new run shall  be conducted using the highest dryness level setting. If the dryer  automatically stops during a cycle because the condensation box is full  of water, the test is stopped, and the test run is invalid, in which  case the condensation box shall be emptied and the test re-run from the  beginning. For ventless dryers, during the time between two cycles, the  door of the dryer shall be closed except for loading (and unloading).</p><p class="depth0">3.4 Data recording.

Starting with a tank at the supply  water temperature, initiate normal operation of the water heater. After  cut-out, determine the mean tank temperature every minute until the  maximum value is observed. Determine whether this maximum value for the  mean tank temperature is within the range of 135 [deg]F5 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C2.8 [deg]C).  If not, turn off the water heater, adjust the thermostat, drain and  refill the tank with supply water. Then, once again, initiate normal  operation of the water heater, and determine the maximum mean tank  temperature after cut-out. Repeat this sequence until the maximum mean   tank temperature after cut-out is 135 [deg]F5  [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C2.8 [deg]C).</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2.2 Tanks with Two or More Thermostats. Follow the same sequence  as for a single thermostat tank, i.e. start at the supply water  temperature, operate normally until cutout. Determine if the thermostat  that controls the uppermost heating element yields a maximum water  temperature of 135 [deg]F5 [deg]F (57.2  [deg]C2.8 [deg]C), as measured by the in-tank  sensors that are positioned above the uppermost heating element. If the  tank temperature at the thermostat is not within 135 [deg]F5 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C2.8 [deg]C),  turn off the water heater, adjust the thermostat, drain and refill the  tank with supply water. The thermostat that controls the heating element  positioned next highest in the tank shall then be set to yield a maximum  water temperature of 135 [deg]F5 [deg]F (57.2  [deg]C2.8 [deg]C). This process shall be repeated  until the thermostat controlling the lowest element is correctly  adjusted. When adjusting the thermostat that controls the lowest  element, the maximum mean tank temperature after cut-out, as determined  using all the in-tank sensors, shall be 135 [deg]F5 [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C2.8 [deg]C).  When adjusting all other thermostats, use only the in-tank temperature  sensors positioned above the heating element in question to evaluate the  maximum water temperature after cut-out.</p><p class="depth0">For heat pump water heaters that control an auxiliary resistive  element, the thermostat shall be set in accordance with the  manufacturer's installation instructions.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.3 Power Input Determination. For all water heaters except  electric types having immersed heating elements, initiate normal  operation and determine the power input, P, to the main burners  (including pilot light power, if any) after 15 minutes of operation. If  the water heater is equipped with a gas appliance pressure regulator,  the regulator outlet pressure shall be set within 10% of that recommended by the manufacturer. For oil- fired water heaters the fuel pump pressure shall be within 10% of the manufacturer's specified pump pressure. All  burners shall be adjusted to achieve an hourly Btu (kJ) rating that is  within 2% of the value specified by the  manufacturer. For an oil-fired water heater, adjust the burner to give a  CO2 reading recommended by the manufacturer and an hourly Btu  (kJ) rating that is within 2% of that specified by  the manufacturer. Smoke in the flue may not exceed No. 1 smoke as  measured by the procedure in ASTM-D-2156-80.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.4 First-Hour Rating Test.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.4.1 General. During hot water draws, remove water at a rate of  3.00.25 gallons per minute (11.40.95 liters per minute). Collect the water in a  container that is large enough to hold the volume removed during an  individual draw and suitable for weighing at the termination of each  draw. Alternatively, a water meter may be used to directly measure the  water volume(s) withdrawn.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.4.2 Draw Initiation Criteria. Begin the first-hour rating test  by imposing a draw on the storage-type water heater. After completion of  this first draw, initiate successive draws based on the following  criteria. For gas-and oil-fired water heaters, initiate successive draws  when the thermostat acts to reduce the supply of fuel to the main  burner. For electric water heaters having a single element or multiple  elements that all operate simultaneously, initiate successive draws when  the thermostat acts to reduce the electrical input supplied to the  element(s). For electric water heaters having two or more elements that  do not operate simultaneously, initiate successive draws when the  applicable thermostat acts to reduce the electrical input to the element  located vertically highest in the storage tank. For heat pump waters  heaters that do not use supplemental resistive heating, initiate  successive draws immediately after the electrical input to the  compressor is reduced by the action of the water heater's thermostat.  For heat pump waters heaters that use supplemental resistive heating,  initiate successive draws immediately after the electrical input to the  compressor or the uppermost resistive element is reduced by the action  of the applicable water heater thermostat. This draw initiation  criterion for heat pump water heaters that use supplemental resistive  heating, however, shall only apply when the water located above the  thermostat at cut-out is heated to 135 [deg]F5  [deg]F (57.2 [deg]C2.8 [deg]C).</p><p class="depth0">5.1.4.3 Test Sequence. Establish normal water heater operation. If  the water heater is not presently operating, initiate a draw. The draw  may be terminated anytime after cut-in occurs. After cut-out occurs  (i.e., all thermostats are satisfied), monitor the internal storage tank  temperature sensors described in section 4.5 every minute.</p><p class="depth0">Initiate a draw after a maximum mean tank temperature has been  observed following cut-out. Record the time when the draw is initiated  and designate it as an elapsed time of zero ([tau]* = 0). (The  superscript * is used to denote variables pertaining to the first-hour  rating test.) Record the outlet water temperature beginning 15 seconds  after the draw is initiated and at 5-second intervals thereafter until  the draw is terminated. Determine the maximum outlet temperature that  occurs during this first draw and record it as T*max, 1. For  the duration of this first draw and all successive draws, in addition,  monitor the inlet temperature to the water heater to ensure that the  required 58 [deg]F2 [deg]F (14.4 [deg]C1.1 [deg]C) test condition is met. Terminate the hot  water draw when the outlet temperature decreases to T*max,1- 25 [deg]F (T*max,1-13.9 [deg]C). Record this temperature as   T*min,1. Following draw termination, determine the average  outlet water temperature and the mass or volume removed during this  first draw and record them as TT*del,1 and M*1 or  V*1, respectively.</p><p class="depth0">Initiate a second and, if applicable, successive draw each time the  applicable draw initiation criteria described in section 5.1.4.2 are  satisfied. As required for the first draw, record the outlet water  temperature 15 seconds after initiating each draw and at 5-second  intervals thereafter until the draw is terminated. Determine the maximum  outlet temperature that occurs during each draw and record it as  T*max, i, where the subscript i refers to the draw number.  Terminate each hot water draw when the outlet temperature decreases to  T*max, i-25 [deg]F (T*max, i-13.9 [deg]C). Record  this temperature as T*min, i. Calculate and record the  average outlet temperature and the mass or volume removed during each  draw (TT*del, i and M*i or V*i,  respectively). Continue this sequence of draw and recovery until one  hour has elapsed, then shut off the electrical power and/or fuel  supplied to the water heater.</p><p class="depth0">If a draw is occurring at an elapsed time of one hour, continue this  draw until the outlet temperature decreases to T*max, n-25  [deg]F (T*max, n -13.9 [deg]C), at which time the draw shall  be immediately terminated. (The subscript n shall be used to denote  quantities associated with the final draw.) If a draw is not occurring  at an elapsed time of one hour, a final draw shall be imposed at one  hour. This draw shall be immediately terminated when the outlet  temperature first indicates a value less than or equal to the cut-off  temperature used for the previous draw (T*min, n-1). For  cases where the outlet temperature is close to T*min, n-1,  the final draw shall proceed for a minimum of 30 seconds. If an outlet  temperature greater than T*min, n-1 is not measured within 30  seconds, the draw shall be immediately terminated and zero additional  credit shall be given towards first-hour rating (i.e., M*n =  0 or V*n = 0). After the final draw is terminated, calculate  and record the average outlet temperature and the mass or volume removed  during the draw (TT*del, n and M*n or  V*n, respectively).</p><p class="depth0">5.1.5 24-Hour Simulated Use Test.

Begin  the 24-hour simulated use test by withdrawing a volume from the water  heater that equals one-sixth of the daily hot water usage. Record the  time when this first draw is initiated and assign it as the test elapsed  time ([tau]) of zero (0). Record the average storage tank and ambient  temperature every 15 minutes throughout the 24-hour simulated use test  unless a recovery or a draw is occurring. At elapsed time intervals of  one, two, three, four, and five hours from [tau] = 0, initiate  additional draws, removing an amount of water equivalent to one-sixth of  the daily hot water usage with the maximum allowable deviation for any  single draw being 0.5 gallons (1.9 liters).

Record the  maximum value of the mean tank temperature after cut-out as  TTsu. Except as noted below, allow the water heater to remain  in the standby mode until 24 hours have elapsed from the start of the  test (i.e., since = 0). Prevent the water heater from beginning a  recovery cycle during the last hour of the test by turning off the  electric power to the electrical heating elements and heat pump, if  present, or by turning down the fuel supply to the main burner at   an elapsed time of 23 hours. If a recovery is taking place at an elapsed  time of 23 hours, wait until the recovery is complete before reducing  the electrical and/or fuel supply to the water heater. At 24 hours,  record the mean tank temperature, TT24, and the electric and/ or fuel instrument readings.

This operational mode shall be  the default mode (or similarly-named, suggested mode for normal  operation) as defined by the manufacturer in its product literature for  giving selection guidance to the consumer. For heat pump water heaters,  if a default mode is not defined in the product literature, each test  shall be conducted under an operational mode in which both the heat pump  and any electric resistance backup heating element(s) are activated by  the unit's control scheme, and which can achieve the internal storage  tank temperature specified in this test procedure; if multiple  operational modes meet these criteria, the water heater shall be tested  under the most energy-intensive mode. If no default mode is specified  and the unit does not offer an operational mode that utilizes both the  heat pump and the electric resistance backup heating element(s), the  first-hour rating test and the simulated-use test shall be tested in  heat-pump-only mode.

For all water heaters except  electric types, initiate normal operation (as described in section 5.1)  and determine the power input, P, to the main burners (including pilot  light power, if any) after 15 minutes of operation. If the water heater  is equipped with a gas appliance pressure regulator, the regulator  outlet pressure shall be set within 10% of that  recommended by the manufacturer.

During hot water draws for water heaters with rated  storage volumes greater than or equal to 20 gallons, remove water at a  rate of 3.0  0.25 gallons per minute (11.4  0.95 liters per minute). During   hot water draws for storage-type water heaters with rated storage  volumes below 20 gallons, remove water at a rate of 1.0  0.25 gallon per minute (3.8  0.95  liters per minute). Collect the water in a container that is large  enough to hold the volume removed during an individual draw and is  suitable for weighing at the termination of each draw to determine the  total volume of water withdrawn. As an alternative to collecting the  water, a water meter may be used to directly measure the water volume(s)  withdrawn.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.3.2 Draw Initiation Criteria. Begin the first-hour rating test  by starting a draw on the storage-type water heater. After completion of  this first draw, initiate successive draws based on the following  criteria. For gas-fired and oil-fired water heaters, initiate successive  draws when the temperature controller acts to reduce the supply of fuel  to the main burner. For electric water heaters having a single element  or multiple elements that all operate simultaneously, initiate  successive draws when the temperature controller acts to reduce the  electrical input supplied to the element(s). For electric water heaters  having two or more elements that do not operate simultaneously, initiate  successive draws when the applicable temperature controller acts to  reduce the electrical input to the energized element located vertically  highest in the storage tank. For heat pump water heaters that do not use  supplemental, resistive heating, initiate successive draws immediately  after the electrical input to the compressor is reduced by the action of  the water heater's temperature controller. For heat pump water heaters  that use supplemental resistive heating, initiate successive draws  immediately after the electrical input to the first of either the  compressor or the vertically highest resistive element is reduced by the  action of the applicable water heater temperature controller. This draw  initiation criterion for heat pump water heaters that use supplemental  resistive heating, however, shall only apply when the water located  above the thermostat at cut-out is heated to 125[emsp14] [deg]F  5[emsp14] [deg]F (51.7 [deg]C   2.8 [deg]C). If this criterion is not met, then the next draw should be  initiated once the heat pump compressor cuts out.</p><p class="depth0">5.3.3.3 Test Sequence. Establish normal water heater operation. If  the water heater is not presently operating, initiate a draw. The draw  may be terminated any time after cut-in occurs. After cut-out occurs  (i.e., all temperature controllers are satisfied), record the internal  storage tank temperature at each sensor described in section 4.5 of this  appendix every one minute, and determine the mean tank temperature by  averaging the values from these sensors.</p><p class="depth0">Initiate a draw after a maximum mean tank temperature (the maximum  of the mean temperatures of the individual sensors) has been observed  following a cut-out. Record the time when the draw is initiated and  designate it as an elapsed time of zero ([tau]* = 0). (The superscript *  is used to denote variables pertaining to the first-hour rating test).  Record the outlet water temperature beginning 15 seconds after the draw  is initiated and at 5-second intervals thereafter until the draw is  terminated. Determine the maximum outlet temperature that occurs during  this first draw and record it as T*max,1. For the duration of  this first draw and all successive draws, in addition, monitor the inlet  temperature to the water heater to ensure that the required 58[emsp14]  [deg]F  2[emsp14] [deg]F (14.4 [deg]C  1.1 [deg]C) test condition is met. Terminate the hot  water draw when the outlet temperature decreases to T*max,1 -  15 [deg]F (T*max,1 - 8.3 [deg]C). (Note, if the outlet  temperature does not decrease to T*max,1 - 15 [deg]F  (T*max,1 - 8.3 [deg]C) during the draw, then hot water would  be drawn continuously for the duration of the test. In this instance,  the test would end when the temperature decreases to T*max,1-  15 [deg]F (T*max,1 - 8.3 [deg]C) after the electrical power  and/or fuel supplied to the water heater is shut off, as described in  the following paragraphs.) Record this temperature as  T*min,1. Following draw termination, determine the average  outlet water temperature and the mass or volume removed during this  first draw and record them as TT*del,i and M*1 or  V*1, respectively.</p><p class="depth0">Initiate a second and, if applicable, successive draw(s) each time  the applicable draw initiation criteria described in section 5.3.3.2 are  satisfied. As required for the first draw, record the outlet water  temperature 15 seconds after initiating each draw and at 5-second  intervals thereafter until the draw is terminated. Determine the maximum  outlet temperature that occurs during each draw and record it as  T*max,i, where the subscript i refers to the draw number.  Terminate each hot water draw when the outlet temperature decreases to  T*max,i - 15 [deg]F (T*max,i - 8.3 [deg]C). Record  this temperature as T*min,i. Calculate and record the average  outlet temperature and the mass or volume removed during each draw  (TT*del,i and M*i or V*i,  respectively). Continue this sequence of draw and recovery until one  hour after the start of the test, then shut off the electrical power  and/or fuel supplied to the water heater.</p><p class="depth0">If a draw is occurring at one hour from the start of the test,  continue this draw until the outlet temperature decreases to  T*max,n - 15 [deg]F (T*max,n - 8.3 [deg]C), at  which time the draw shall be immediately terminated. (The subscript n  shall be used to denote measurements associated with the final draw.) If  a draw is not occurring one hour after the start of the test, initiate a  final draw at one hour, regardless of whether the criteria described in  section 5.3.3.2 of this appendix are satisfied. This draw shall proceed  for a minimum of 30 seconds and shall terminate when the outlet  temperature first indicates a   value less than or equal to the cut-off temperature used for the  previous draw (T*min,n-1). If an outlet temperature greater  than T*min,n-1 is not measured within 30 seconds of  initiation of the draw, zero additional credit shall be given towards  first-hour rating (i.e., M*n = 0 or V*n = 0) based  on the final draw. After the final draw is terminated, calculate and  record the average outlet temperature and the mass or volume removed  during the final draw (TT*del,n and M*n or  V*n, respectively).</p><p class="depth0">5.4 24-Hour Simulated Use Test.</p><p class="depth0">5.4.1 Selection of Draw Pattern.

If the water heater has undergone a first-hour  rating test prior to conduct of the simulated-use test, allow the water  heater to fully recover after completion of that test such that the main  burner, heating elements, or heat pump compressor of the water heater  are no longer raising the temperature of the stored water. In all cases,  the water heater shall sit idle for 1 hour prior to the start of the 24- hour test; during which time no water is drawn from the unit and there  is no energy input to the main heating elements, heat pump compressor,  and/or burners. At the end of this period, the 24-hour simulated-use  test will begin.</p><p class="depth0">At the start of the 24-hour test, record the mean tank temperature  (TT0), and the electrical and/or fuel measurement readings,  as appropriate. Begin the 24-hour simulated use test by withdrawing the  volume specified in the appropriate table in section 5.5 of this  appendix (i.e., Table III.1, Table III.2, Table III.3, or Table III.4,  depending on the first-hour rating or maximum GPM rating) for the first  draw at the flow rate specified in the applicable table. Record the time  when this first draw is initiated and assign it as the test elapsed time  ([tau]) of zero (0). Record the average storage tank and ambient  temperature every minute throughout the 24-hour simulated-use test. At  the elapsed times specified in the applicable draw pattern table in  section 5.5 of this appendix for a particular draw pattern, initiate  additional draws pursuant to the draw pattern, removing the volume of  hot water at the prescribed flow rate specified by the table. The  maximum allowable deviation from the specified volume of water removed  for any single draw taken at a nominal flow rate of 1 GPM or 1.7 GPM is  0.1 gallons (0.4 liters).  The maximum allowable deviation from the specified volume of water  removed for any single draw   taken at a nominal flow rate of 3 GPM is 0.25  gallons (0.9 liters). The quantity of water withdrawn during the last  draw shall be increased or decreased as necessary such that the total  volume of water withdrawn equals the prescribed daily amount for that  draw pattern 1.0 gallon (3.8  liters).

Waivers and Field Testing</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Waivers and Field Testing for Non-conventional Clothes Washers.  Manufacturers of nonconventional clothes washers, such as clothes  washers with adaptive control systems, must submit a petition for waiver  pursuant to 10 CFR 430.27 to establish an acceptable test procedure for  that clothes washer. For these and other clothes washers that have  controls or systems such that the DOE test procedures yield results that  are so unrepresentative of the clothes washer's true energy consumption  characteristics as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data,  field testing may be appropriate for establishing an acceptable test  procedure. The following are guidelines for field testing which may be  used by manufacturers in support of petitions for waiver. These  guidelines are not mandatory and the Department may determine that they  do not apply to a particular model. Depending upon a manufacturer's  approach for conducting field testing, additional data may be required.  Manufacturers are encouraged to communicate with the Department prior to  the commencement of field tests which may be used to support a petition  for waiver. Section 6.3 provides an example of field testing for a  clothes washer with an adaptive water fill control system. Other  features, such as the use of various spin speed selections, could be the  subject of field tests.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Nonconventional Wash System Energy Consumption Test. The field  test may consist of a minimum of 10 of the nonconventional clothes  washers (``test clothes washers'') and 10 clothes washers already being  distributed in commerce (``base clothes washers''). The tests should  include a minimum of 50 energy test cycles per clothes washer. The test  clothes washers and base clothes washers should be identical in  construction except for the controls or systems being tested. Equal  numbers of both the test clothes washer and the base clothes washer  should be tested simultaneously in comparable settings to minimize  seasonal or consumer laundering conditions or variations. The clothes  washers should be monitored in such a way as to accurately record the  average total energy and water consumption per cycle, including water  heating energy when electrically heated water is used, and the energy  required to remove the remaining moisture of the test load. The field  test results should be used to determine the best method to correlate  the rating of the test clothes washer to the rating of the base clothes  washer.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Adaptive water fill control system field test. Section 3.2.3.1  defines the test method for measuring energy consumption for clothes  washers which incorporate control systems having both adaptive and  alternate cycle selections. Energy consumption calculated by the method  defined in section 3.2.3.1 assumes the adaptive cycle will be used 50  percent of the time. This section can be used to develop field test data  in support of a petition for waiver when it is believed that the  adaptive cycle will be used more than 50 percent of the time. The field  test sample size should be a minimum of 10 test clothes washers. The  test clothes washers should be totally representative of the design,  construction, and control system that will be placed in commerce. The  duration of field testing in the user's house should be a minimum of 50  energy test cycles, for each unit. No special instructions as to cycle  selection or product usage should be given to the field test  participants, other than inclusion of the product literature pack which  would be shipped with all units, and instructions regarding filling out  data collection forms, use of data collection equipment, or basic  procedural methods. Prior to the test clothes washers being installed in  the field test locations, baseline data should be developed for all  field test units by conducting laboratory tests as defined by section 1  through section 5 of these test procedures to determine the energy  consumption, water consumption, and remaining moisture content values.  The following data should be measured and recorded for each wash load  during the test period: wash cycle selected, the mode of the clothes  washer (adaptive or manual), clothes load dry weight (measured after the  clothes washer and clothes dryer cycles are completed) in pounds, and  type of articles in the clothes load (e.g., cottons, linens, permanent  press). The wash loads used in calculating the in-home percentage split  between adaptive and manual cycle usage should be only those wash loads  which conform to the definition of the energy test cycle.</p><p class="depth0">Calculate:     T=The total number of energy test cycles run during the field test Ta = The total number of adaptive control energy test cycles Tm = The total number of manual control energy test cycles</p><p class="depth0">The percentage weighting factors:  Pa = (Ta/T)x100 (the percentage weighting for  adaptive control selection) Pm = (Tm/T)x100 (the percentage weighting for  manual control selection)</p><p class="depth0">Energy consumption (HET, MET, and  DE) and water consumption (QT), values calculated  in section 4 for the manual and adaptive modes, should be combined using  Pa and Pm as the weighting factors.

Waivers and Field Testing</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Waivers and Field Testing for Nonconventional Clothes Washers.  Manufacturers of nonconventional clothes washers, such as clothes  washers with adaptive control systems, must submit a petition for waiver  pursuant to 10 CFR 430.27 to establish an acceptable test procedure for  that clothes washer if the washer cannot be tested pursuant to the DOE  test procedure or the DOE test procedure yields results that are so  unrepresentative of the clothes washer's true energy consumption  characteristics as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. In  such cases, field testing may be appropriate for establishing an  acceptable test procedure. The following are guidelines for field  testing which may be used by manufacturers in support of petitions for  waiver. These guidelines are not mandatory and the Department may  determine that they do not apply to a particular model. Depending upon a  manufacturer's approach for conducting field testing, additional data  may be required. Manufacturers are encouraged to communicate with the  Department prior to the commencement of field tests which may be used to  support a petition for waiver. Section 6.3 of this Appendix provides an  example of field testing for a clothes washer with an adaptive water  fill control system. Other features, such as the use of various spin  speed selections, could be the subject of field tests.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Nonconventional Wash System Energy Consumption Test. The field  test may consist of a minimum of 10 of the nonconventional clothes  washers (``test clothes washers'') and 10 clothes washers already being  distributed in commerce (``base clothes washers''). The tests should  include a minimum of 50 energy test cycles per clothes washer. The test   clothes washers and base clothes washers should be identical in  construction except for the controls or systems being tested. Equal  numbers of both the test clothes washer and the base clothes washer  should be tested simultaneously in comparable settings to minimize  seasonal or consumer laundering conditions or variations. The clothes  washers should be monitored in such a way as to accurately record the  average total energy and water consumption per cycle, including water  heating energy when electrically heated water is used, and the energy  required to remove the remaining moisture of the test load. Standby and  off mode energy consumption should be measured according to section 4.4  of this test procedure. The field test results should be used to  determine the best method to correlate the rating of the test clothes  washer to the rating of the base clothes washer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section  3.2.3.1 of this Appendix defines the test method for measuring energy  consumption for clothes washers which incorporate both adaptive and  alternate manual water fill control systems. Energy consumption  calculated by the method defined in section 3.2.3.1 of this Appendix  assumes the adaptive cycle will be used 50 percent of the time. This  section can be used to develop field test data in support of a petition  for waiver when it is believed that the adaptive cycle will be used more  than 50 percent of the time. The field test sample size should be a  minimum of 10 test clothes washers. The test clothes washers should be  representative of the design, construction, and control system that will  be placed in commerce. The duration of field testing in the user's house  should be a minimum of 50 energy test cycles, for each unit. No special  instructions as to cycle selection or product usage should be given to  the field test participants, other than inclusion of the product  literature pack which would be shipped with all units, and instructions  regarding filling out data collection forms, use of data collection  equipment, or basic procedural methods. Prior to the test clothes  washers being installed in the field test locations, baseline data  should be developed for all field test units by conducting laboratory  tests as defined by section 1 through section 5 of this Appendix to  determine the energy consumption, water consumption, and remaining  moisture content values. The following data should be measured and  recorded for each wash load during the test period: Wash cycle selected,  the mode of the clothes washer (adaptive or manual), clothes load dry  weight (measured after the clothes washer and clothes dryer cycles are  completed) in pounds, and type of articles in the clothes load (e.g.,  cottons, linens, permanent press). The wash loads used in calculating  the in-home percentage split between adaptive and manual cycle usage  should be only those wash loads which conform to the definition of the  energy test cycle.</p><p class="depth0">Calculate:  T=The total number of energy test cycles run during the field test. Ta = The total number of adaptive control energy test cycles. Tm = The total number of manual control energy test cycles.</p><p class="depth0">The percentage weighting factors:  Pa = (Ta/T) x 100% (the percentage weighting for</p><p class="depth0">adaptive control selection) Pm = (Tm/T) x 100% (the percentage weighting for</p><p class="depth0">manual control selection)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Energy consumption (HET, MET, and  DE) and water consumption (QT), values calculated  in section 4 of this Appendix for the manual and adaptive modes, should  be combined using Pa and Pm as the weighting  factors.

Test using two side-by-side rooms, an  indoor test room and an outdoor test room. For multiple-split air  conditioners and heat pumps (see Definition 1.30), however, use as many  available indoor test rooms as needed to accommodate the total number of  indoor units. These rooms must comply with the requirements specified in  sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 430.22).</p><p class="depth0">b. Inside these test rooms, use artificial loads during cyclic tests  and frost accumulation tests, if needed, to produce stabilized room air  temperatures. For one room, select an electric resistance heater(s)  having a heating capacity that is approximately equal to the heating  capacity of the test unit's condenser. For the second room, select a  heater(s) having a capacity that is close to the sensible cooling  capacity of the test unit's evaporator. When applied, cycle the heater  located in the same room as the test   unit evaporator coil ON and OFF when the test unit cycles ON and OFF.  Cycle the heater located in the same room as the test unit condensing  coil ON and OFF when the test unit cycles OFF and ON.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Test unit installation requirements. a. Install the unit  according to section 8.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 430.22). With respect to interconnecting tubing  used when testing split systems, however, follow the requirements given  in section 6.1.3.5 of ARI Standard 210/240-2006 (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 430.22). When testing triple-split systems (see  Definition 1.44), use the tubing length specified in section 6.1.3.5 of  ARI Standard 210/240-2006 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22)  to connect the outdoor coil, indoor compressor section, and indoor coil  while still meeting the requirement of exposing 10 feet of the tubing to  outside conditions. When testing split systems having multiple indoor  coils, connect each indoor fan-coil to the outdoor unit using: (a) 25  feet of tubing, or (b) tubing furnished by the manufacturer, whichever  is longer. If they are needed to make a secondary measurement of  capacity, install refrigerant pressure measuring instruments as  described in section 8.2.5 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 430.22). Refer to section 2.10 of this appendix to  learn which secondary methods require refrigerant pressure measurements.  At a minimum, insulate the low-pressure line(s) of a split-system with  insulation having an inside diameter that matches the refrigerant tubing  and a nominal thickness of 0.5 inch.</p><p class="depth0">b. For units designed for both horizontal and vertical installation  or for both up-flow and down-flow vertical installations, the  manufacturer must specify the orientation used for testing. Conduct  testing with the following installed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> the most restrictive filter(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> supplementary heating coils; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> other equipment specified as part of the unit, including all  hardware used by a heat comfort controller if so equipped (see  Definition 1.28). For small-duct, high-velocity systems, configure all  balance dampers or restrictor devices on or inside the unit to fully  open or lowest restriction.</p><p class="depth0">c. Testing a ducted unit without having an indoor air filter  installed is permissible as long as the minimum external static pressure  requirement is adjusted as stated in Table 2, note 3 (see section  3.1.4). Except as noted in section 3.1.9, prevent the indoor air  supplementary heating coils from operating during all tests. For coil- only indoor units that are supplied without an enclosure, create an  enclosure using 1 inch fiberglass ductboard having a nominal density of  6 pounds per cubic foot. Or alternatively, use some other insulating  material having a thermal resistance (``R'' value) between 4 and 6  hr[middot]ft\2\[middot] [deg]F/Btu. For units where the coil is housed  within an enclosure or cabinet, no extra insulating or sealing is  allowed.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.1 Defrost control settings. Set heat pump defrost controls at  the normal settings which most typify those encountered in generalized  climatic region IV. (Refer to Figure 2 and Table 17 of section 4.2 for  information on region IV.) For heat pumps that use a time-adaptive  defrost control system (see Definition 1.42), the manufacturer must  specify the frosting interval to be used during Frost Accumulation tests  and provide the procedure for manually initiating the defrost at the  specified time. To ease testing of any unit, the manufacturer should  provide information and any necessary hardware to manually initiate a  defrost cycle.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2 Special requirements for units having a multiple-speed outdoor  fan. Configure the multiple-speed outdoor fan according to the  manufacturer's specifications, and thereafter, leave it unchanged for  all tests. The controls of the unit must regulate the operation of the  outdoor fan during all lab tests except dry coil cooling mode tests. For  dry coil cooling mode tests, the outdoor fan must operate at the same  speed used during the required wet coil test conducted at the same  outdoor test conditions.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.3 Special requirements for multi-split air conditioners and heat  pumps, and systems composed of multiple mini-split units (outdoor units  located side-by-side) that would normally operate using two or more  indoor thermostats. For any test where the system is operated at part  load (i.e., one or more compressors ``off'', operating at the  intermediate or minimum compressor speed, or at low compressor  capacity), the manufacturer shall designate the particular indoor coils  that are turned off during the test. For variable-speed systems, the  manufacturer must designate at least one indoor unit that is turned off  for all tests conducted at minimum compressor speed. For all other part- load tests, the manufacturer shall choose to turn off zero, one, two, or  more indoor units. The chosen configuration shall remain unchanged for  all tests conducted at the same compressor speed/capacity. For any  indoor coil that is turned off during a test, take steps to cease forced  airflow through this indoor coil and block its outlet duct. Because  these types of systems will have more than one indoor fan and possibly  multiple outdoor fans and compressor systems, references in this test  procedure to a single indoor fan, outdoor fan, and compressor means all  indoor fans, all outdoor fans, and all compressor systems that are  turned on during the test.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.4 Wet-bulb temperature requirements for the air entering the  indoor and outdoor coils.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.4.1 Cooling mode tests. For wet-coil cooling mode tests,  regulate the water vapor   content of the air entering the indoor unit to the applicable wet-bulb  temperature listed in Tables 3 to 6. As noted in these same tables,  achieve a wet-bulb temperature during dry-coil cooling mode tests that  results in no condensate forming on the indoor coil. Controlling the  water vapor content of the air entering the outdoor side of the unit is  not required for cooling mode tests except when testing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Units that reject condensate to the outdoor coil during wet coil  tests. Tables 3-6 list the applicable wet-bulb temperatures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Single-packaged units where all or part of the indoor section is  located in the outdoor test room. The average dew point temperature of  the air entering the outdoor coil during wet coil tests must be within  3.0 [deg]F of the average dew point temperature of  the air entering the indoor coil over the 30-minute data collection  interval described in section 3.3. For dry coil tests on such units, it  may be necessary to limit the moisture content of the air entering the  outdoor side of the unit to meet the requirements of section 3.4.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.4.2 Heating mode tests. For heating mode tests, regulate the  water vapor content of the air entering the outdoor unit to the  applicable wet-bulb temperature listed in Tables 9 to 12. The wet-bulb  temperature entering the indoor side of the heat pump must not exceed 60  [deg]F. Additionally, if the Outdoor Air Enthalpy test method is used  while testing a single-packaged heat pump where all or part of the  outdoor section is located in the indoor test room, adjust the wet-bulb  temperature for the air entering the indoor side to yield an indoor-side  dew point temperature that is as close as reasonably possible to the dew  point temperature of the outdoor-side entering air.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.5 Additional refrigerant charging requirements. Charging  according to the ``manufacturer's published instructions,'' as stated in  section 8.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 430.22), means the manufacturer's installation instructions that  come packaged with the unit.If a unit requires charging but the  installation instructions do not specify a charging procedure, then  evacuate the unit and add the nameplate refrigerant charge. Where the  manufacturer's installation instructions contain two sets of refrigerant  charging criteria, one for field installations and one for lab testing,  use the field installation criteria. For third-party testing, the test  laboratory may consult with the manufacturer about the refrigerant  charging procedure and make any needed corrections so long as they do  not contradict the published installation instructions. The manufacturer  may specify an alternative charging criteria to the third-party  laboratory so long as the manufacturer thereafter revises the published  installation instructions accordingly.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Indoor air volume rates. If a unit's controls allow for  overspeeding the indoor fan (usually on a temporary basis), take the  necessary steps to prevent overspeeding during all tests.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1 Cooling tests. a. Set indoor fan control options (e.g., fan  motor pin settings, fan motor speed) according to the published  installation instructions that are provided with the equipment while  meeting the airflow requirements that are specified in sections 3.1.4.1  to 3.1.4.3.</p><p class="depth0">b. Express the Cooling Full-load Air Volume Rate, the Cooling  Minimum Air Volume Rate, and the Cooling Intermediate Air Volume Rate in  terms of standard air.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.2 Heating tests. a. If needed, set the indoor fan control  options (e.g., fan motor pin settings, fan motor speed) according to the  published installation instructions that are provided with the  equipment. Do this set-up while meeting all applicable airflow  requirements specified in sections 3.1.4.4 to 3.1.4.7.</p><p class="depth0">b. Express the Heating Certified Air Volume Rate, the Heating  Minimum Air Volume Rate, the Heating Intermediate Air Volume Rate, and  the Heating Nominal Air Volume Rate in terms of standard air.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Indoor coil inlet and outlet duct connections. Insulate and/or  construct the outlet plenum described in section 2.4.1 and, if  installed, the inlet plenum described in section 2.4.2 with thermal  insulation having a nominal overall sistance (R-value) of at least 19  hr[middot]ft\2\[middot] [deg]F/Btu.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.1 Outlet plenum for the indoor unit. a. Attach a plenum to the  outlet of the indoor coil. (Note: for some packaged systems, the indoor  coil may be located in the outdoor test room.)</p><p class="depth0">b. For systems having multiple indoor coils, attach a plenum to each  indoor coil outlet. Connect two or more outlet plenums to a single  common duct so that each indoor coil ultimately connects to an airflow  measuring apparatus (section 2.6). If using more than one indoor test  room, do likewise, creating one or more common ducts within each test  room that contains multiple indoor coils. At the plane where each plenum  enters a common duct, install an adjustable airflow damper and use it to  equalize the static pressure in each plenum. Each outlet air temperature  grid (section 2.5.4) and airflow measuring apparatus are located  downstream of the inlet(s) to the common duct.</p><p class="depth0">c. For small-duct, high-velocity systems, install an outlet plenum  that has a diameter that is equal to or less than the value listed  below. The limit depends only on the cooling Full-Load Air Volume Rate  (see section 3.1.4.1.1) and is effective regardless of the flange  dimensions on the outlet of the unit (or an air supply plenum adapter  accessory, if installed in accordance with the manufacturer's  installation instructions).</p><p class="depth0">d. Add a static pressure tap to each face of the (each) outlet  plenum, if rectangular, or at four evenly distributed locations along  the circumference of an oval or round plenum. Create a manifold that  connects the four static pressure taps. Figure 1 shows two of the three  options allowed for the manifold configuration; the third option is the  broken-ring, four-to-one manifold configuration that is shown in Figure  7a of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  430.22). See Figures 7a, 7b, 7c, and 8 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) for the cross-sectional  dimensions and minimum length of the (each) plenum and the locations for  adding the static pressure taps for units tested with and without an  indoor fan installed.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Maximum diameter* of</p><p class="depth0">Cooling full-load air volume rate (scfm)      outlet plenum (inches) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ <=500..........................................                        6 501 to 700.....................................                        7 701 to 900.....................................                        8 901 to 1100....................................                        9 1101 to 1400...................................                       10 1401 to 1750...................................                       11 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ *If the outlet plenum is rectangular, calculate its equivalent diameter</p><p class="depth0">using (4A/P,) where A is the area and P is the perimeter of the</p><p class="depth0">rectangular plenum, and compare it to the listed maximum diameter.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.2 Inlet plenum for the indoor unit. Install an inlet plenum when  testing a coil-only indoor unit or a packaged system where the indoor  coil is located in the outdoor test room. Add static pressure taps at  the center of each face of this plenum, if rectangular, or at four  evenly distributed locations along the circumference of an oval or round  plenum. Make a manifold that connects the four static-pressure taps  using one of the three configurations specified in section 2.4.1. See  Figures 7b, 7c, and Figure 8 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 430.22) for cross-sectional dimensions, the minimum  length of the inlet plenum, and the locations of the static-pressure  taps. When testing a ducted unit having an indoor fan (and the indoor  coil is in the indoor test room), the manufacturer has the option to  test with or without an inlet plenum installed. Space limitations within  the test room may dictate that the manufacturer choose the latter  option. If used, construct the inlet plenum and add the four static- pressure taps as shown in Figure 8 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). Manifold the four static- pressure taps using one of the three configurations specified in section  2.4.1. Never use an inlet plenum when testing a non-ducted system.</p><p class="depth0">2.5 Indoor coil air property measurements and air damper box  applications. a. Measure the dry-bulb temperature and water vapor  content of the air entering and leaving the indoor coil. If needed, use  an air sampling device to divert air to a sensor(s) that measures the  water vapor content of the air. See Figure 2 of ASHRAE Standard 41.1-86  (RA 01) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) for guidance on  constructing an air sampling device. The sampling device may also divert  air to a remotely located sensor(s) that measures dry bulb temperature.  The air sampling device and the remotely located temperature sensor(s)  may be used to determine the entering air dry bulb temperature during  any test. The air sampling device and the remotely located leaving air  dry bulb temperature sensor(s) may be used for all tests except:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cyclic tests; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Frost accumulation tests.</p><p class="depth0">b. An acceptable alternative in all cases, including the two special  cases noted above, is to install a grid of dry bulb temperature sensors  within the outlet and inlet ducts. Use a temperature grid to get the  average dry bulb temperature at one location, leaving or entering, or  when two grids are applied as a thermopile, to directly obtain the  temperature difference. A grid of temperature sensors (which may also be  used for determining average leaving air dry bulb temperature) is  required to measure the temperature distribution within a cross-section  of the leaving airstream.</p><p class="depth0">c. Use an inlet and outlet air damper box when testing ducted  systems if conducting one or both of the cyclic tests listed in sections  3.2 and 3.6. Otherwise, install an outlet air damper box when testing  heat pumps, both ducted and non-ducted, that cycle off the indoor fan  during defrost cycles if no other means is available for preventing  natural or forced convection through the indoor unit when the indoor fan  is off. Never use an inlet damper box when testing a non-ducted system.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.1 Test set-up on the inlet side of the indoor coil: for cases  where the inlet damper box is installed. a. Install the inlet side  damper box as specified in section 2.5.1.1 or 2.5.1.2, whichever  applies. Insulate or construct the ductwork between the point where the  air damper is installed and where the connection is made to either the  inlet plenum (section 2.5.1.1 units) or the indoor unit (section 2.5.1.2  units) with thermal insulation that has a nominal overall resistance (R- value) of at least 19 hr[middot]ft\2\[middot] [deg]F/Btu.</p><p class="depth0">b. Locate the grid of entering air dry-bulb temperature sensors, if  used, at the inlet of the damper box. Locate the air sampling device, or  the sensor used to measure the water vapor content of the inlet air, at  a location immediately upstream of the damper box inlet.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.1.1 If the section 2.4.2 inlet plenum is installed. Install the  inlet damper box upstream of the inlet plenum. The cross-sectional flow  area of the damper box must be   equal to or greater than the flow area of the inlet plenum. If needed,  use an adaptor plate or a transition duct section to connect the damper  box with the inlet plenum.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.1.2 If the section 2.4.2 inlet plenum is not installed. Install  the damper box immediately upstream of the air inlet of the indoor unit.  The cross-sectional dimensions of the damper box must be equal to or  greater than the dimensions of the indoor unit inlet. If needed, use an  adaptor plate or a short transition duct section to connect the damper  box with the unit's air inlet. Add static pressure taps at the center of  each face of the damper box, if rectangular, or at four evenly  distributed locations along the circumference, if oval or round. Locate  the pressure taps between the inlet damper and the inlet of the indoor  unit. Make a manifold that connects the four static pressure taps.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.2 Test set-up on the inlet side of the indoor unit: for cases  where no inlet damper box is installed. If using the section 2.4.2 inlet  plenum and a grid of dry bulb temperature sensors, mount the grid at a  location upstream of the static pressure taps described in section  2.4.2, preferably at the entrance plane of the inlet plenum. If the  section 2.4.2 inlet plenum is not used, but a grid of dry bulb  temperature sensors is used, locate the grid approximately 6 inches  upstream from the inlet of the indoor coil. Or, in the case of non- ducted units having multiple indoor coils, locate a grid approximately 6  inches upstream from the inlet of each indoor coil. Position an air  sampling device, or the sensor used to measure the water vapor content  of the inlet air, immediately upstream of the (each) entering air dry- bulb temperature sensor grid. If a grid of sensors is not used, position  the entering air sampling device (or the sensor used to measure the  water vapor content of the inlet air) as if the grid were present.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.3 Indoor coil static pressure difference measurement. Section  6.5.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  430.22) describes the method for fabricating static-pressure taps. Also  refer to Figure 2A of ASHRAE Standard 51-99/AMCA Standard 210-99  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). Use a differential  pressure measuring instrument that is accurate to within 0.01 inches of water and has a resolution of at least  0.01 inches of water to measure the static pressure difference between  the indoor coil air inlet and outlet. Connect one side of the  differential pressure instrument to the manifolded pressure taps  installed in the outlet plenum. Connect the other side of the instrument  to the manifolded pressure taps located in either the inlet plenum or  incorporated within the air damper box. If an inlet plenum or inlet  damper box are not used, leave the inlet side of the differential  pressure instrument open to the surrounding atmosphere. For non-ducted  systems that are tested with multiple outlet plenums, measure the static  pressure within each outlet plenum relative to the surrounding  atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.4 Test set-up on the outlet side of the indoor coil. a. Install  an interconnecting duct between the outlet plenum described in section  2.4.1 and the airflow measuring apparatus described below in section  2.6. The cross-sectional flow area of the interconnecting duct must be  equal to or greater than the flow area of the outlet plenum or the  common duct used when testing non-ducted units having multiple indoor  coils. If needed, use adaptor plates or transition duct sections to  allow the connections. To minimize leakage, tape joints within the  interconnecting duct (and the outlet plenum). Construct or insulate the  entire flow section with thermal insulation having a nominal overall  resistance (R-value) of at least 19 hr[middot]ft\2\[middot] [deg]F/Btu.</p><p class="depth0">b. Install a grid(s) of dry-bulb temperature sensors inside the  interconnecting duct. Also, install an air sampling device, or the  sensor(s) used to measure the water vapor content of the outlet air,  inside the interconnecting duct. Locate the dry-bulb temperature grid(s)  upstream of the air sampling device (or the in-duct sensor(s) used to  measure the water vapor content of the outlet air). Air that circulates  through an air sampling device and past a remote water-vapor-content  sensor(s) must be returned to the interconnecting duct at a point:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Downstream of the air sampling device;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upstream of the outlet air damper box, if installed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Upstream of the section 2.6 airflow measuring apparatus.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.4.1 Outlet air damper box placement and requirements. If using  an outlet air damper box (see section 2.5), install it within the  interconnecting duct at a location downstream of the location where air  from the sampling device is reintroduced or downstream of the in-duct  sensor that measures water vapor content of the outlet air. The leakage  rate from the combination of the outlet plenum, the closed damper, and  the duct section that connects these two components must not exceed 20  cubic feet per minute when a negative pressure of 1 inch of water column  is maintained at the plenum's inlet.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.4.2 Procedures to minimize temperature maldistribution. Use  these procedures if necessary to correct temperature maldistributions.  Install a mixing device(s) upstream of the outlet air, dry-bulb  temperature grid (but downstream of the outlet plenum static pressure  taps). Use a perforated screen located between the mixing device and the  dry-bulb temperature grid, with a maximum open area of 40 percent. One  or both items should help to meet the maximum outlet air temperature  distribution specified in section   3.1.8. Mixing devices are described in sections 6.3--6.5 of ASHRAE  Standard 41.1-86 (RA 01) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22)  and section 5.2.2 of ASHRAE Standard 41.2-87 (RA 92) (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 430.22).</p><p class="depth0">2.5.4.3 Minimizing air leakage. For small-duct, high-velocity  systems, install an air damper near the end of the interconnecting duct,  just prior to the transition to the airflow measuring apparatus of  section 2.6. To minimize air leakage, adjust this damper such that the  pressure in the receiving chamber of the airflow measuring apparatus is  no more than 0.5 inch of water higher than the surrounding test room  ambient. In lieu of installing a separate damper, use the outlet air  damper box of sections 2.5 and 2.5.4.1 if it allows variable  positioning. Also apply these steps to any conventional indoor blower  unit that creates a static pressure within the receiving chamber of the  airflow measuring apparatus that exceeds the test room ambient pressure  by more than 0.5 inches of water column.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.5 Dry bulb temperature measurement. a. Measure dry bulb  temperatures as specified in sections 4, 5, 6.1-6.10, 9, 10, and 11 of  ASHRAE Standard 41.1-86 (RA 01) (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  430.22). The transient testing requirements cited in section 4.3 of  ASHRAE Standard 41.1-86 (RA 01) (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  430.22) apply if conducting a cyclic or frost accumulation test.</p><p class="depth0">b. Distribute the sensors of a dry-bulb temperature grid over the  entire flow area. The required minimum is 9 sensors per grid.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.6 Water vapor content measurement. Determine water vapor content  by measuring dry-bulb temperature combined with the air wet-bulb  temperature, dew point temperature, or relative humidity. If used,  construct and apply wet-bulb temperature sensors as specified in  sections 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 of ASHRAE Standard 41.1-86 (RA 01)  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). As specified in ASHRAE  41.1-86 (RA 01) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22), the  temperature sensor (wick removed) must be accurate to within 0.2 [deg]F. If used, apply dew point hygrometers as  specified in sections 5 and 8 of ASHRAE Standard 41.6-94 (RA 01)  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). The dew point hygrometers  must be accurate to within 0.4 [deg]F when  operated at conditions that result in the evaluation of dew points above  35 [deg]F. If used, a relative humidity (RH) meter must be accurate to  within 0.7% RH. Other means to determine the  psychrometric state of air may be used as long as the measurement  accuracy is equivalent to or better than the accuracy achieved from  using a wet-bulb temperature sensor that meets the above specifications.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.7 Air damper box performance requirements. If used (see section  2.5), the air damper box(es) must be capable of being completely opened  or completely closed within 10 seconds for each action.</p><p class="depth0">2.6 Airflow measuring apparatus. a. Fabricate and operate an Air  Flow Measuring Apparatus as specified in section 6.6 of ASHRAE Standard  116-95 (RA05) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22). Refer to  Figure 12 of ASHRAE Standard 51-99/AMCA Standard 210-99 (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 430.22) or Figure 14 of ASHRAE Standard 41.2-87 (RA  92) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) for guidance on  placing the static pressure taps and positioning the diffusion baffle  (settling means) relative to the chamber inlet.</p><p class="depth0">b. Connect the airflow measuring apparatus to the interconnecting  duct section described in section 2.5.4. See sections 6.1.1, 6.1.2, and  6.1.4, and Figures 1, 2, and 4 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated  by reference, see Sec. 430.22), and Figures D1, D2, and D4 of ARI  Standard 210/240-2006 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) for  illustrative examples of how the test apparatus may be applied within a  complete laboratory set-up. Instead of following one of these examples,  an alternative set-up may be used to handle the air leaving the airflow  measuring apparatus and to supply properly conditioned air to the test  unit's inlet. The alternative set-up, however, must not interfere with  the prescribed means for measuring airflow rate, inlet and outlet air  temperatures, inlet and outlet water vapor contents, and external static  pressures, nor create abnormal conditions surrounding the test unit.  (Note: Do not use an enclosure as described in section 6.1.3 of ASHRAE  Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) when  testing triple-split units.)</p><p class="depth0">2.7 Electrical voltage supply. Perform all tests at the voltage  specified in section 6.1.3.2 of ARI Standard 210/240-2006 (incorporated  by reference, see Sec. 430.22) for ``Standard Rating Tests.'' Measure  the supply voltage at the terminals on the test unit using a volt meter  that provides a reading that is accurate to within 1.0 percent of the measured quantity.</p><p class="depth0">2.8 Electrical power and energy measurements. a. Use an integrating  power (watt-hour) measuring system to determine the electrical energy or  average electrical power supplied to all components of the air  conditioner or heat pump (including auxiliary components such as  controls, transformers, crankcase heater, integral condensate pump on  non-ducted indoor units, etc.). The watt-hour measuring system must give  readings that are accurate to within 0.5 percent.  For cyclic tests, this accuracy is required during both the ON and OFF  cycles. Use either two different scales on the same watt-hour meter or  two separate watt-hour meters. Activate the scale or meter having the  lower power rating within 15 seconds after beginning an   OFF cycle. Activate the scale or meter having the higher power rating  active within 15 seconds prior to beginning an ON cycle. For ducted  units tested with a fan installed, the ON cycle lasts from compressor ON  to indoor fan OFF. For ducted units tested without an indoor fan  installed, the ON cycle lasts from compressor ON to compressor OFF. For  non-ducted units, the ON cycle lasts from indoor fan ON to indoor fan  OFF. When testing air conditioners and heat pumps having a variable- speed compressor, avoid using an induction watt/watt-hour meter.</p><p class="depth0">b. When performing section 3.5 and/or 3.8 cyclic tests on non-ducted  units, provide instrumentation to determine the average electrical power  consumption of the indoor fan motor to within 1.0  percent. If required according to sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.9.1, and/or  3.10, this same instrumentation requirement applies when testing air  conditioners and heat pumps having a variable-speed constant-air-volume- rate indoor fan or a variable-speed, variable-air-volume-rate indoor  fan.</p><p class="depth0">2.9 Time measurements. Make elapsed time measurements using an  instrument that yields readings accurate to within 0.2 percent.</p><p class="depth0">2.10 Test apparatus for the secondary space conditioning capacity  measurement. For all tests, use the Indoor Air Enthalpy Method to  measure the unit's capacity. This method uses the test set-up specified  in sections 2.4 to 2.6. In addition, for all steady-state tests, conduct  a second, independent measurement of capacity as described in section  3.1.1. For split systems, use one of the following secondary measurement  methods: Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method, Compressor Calibration Method, or  Refrigerant Enthalpy Method. For single packaged units, use either the  Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method or the Compressor Calibration Method as the  secondary measurement.</p><p class="depth0">2.10.1 Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method. a. To make a secondary  measurement of indoor space conditioning capacity using the Outdoor Air  Enthalpy Method, do the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Measure the electrical power consumption of the test unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Measure the air-side capacity at the outdoor coil; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Apply a heat balance on the refrigerant cycle.</p><p class="depth0">b. The test apparatus required for the Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method  is a subset of the apparatus used for the Indoor Air Enthalpy Method.  Required apparatus includes the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An outlet plenum containing static pressure taps (sections 2.4,  2.4.1, and 2.5.3),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An airflow measuring apparatus (section 2.6),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A duct section that connects these two components and itself  contains the instrumentation for measuring the dry-bulb temperature and  water vapor content of the air leaving the outdoor coil (sections 2.5.4,  2.5.5, and 2.5.6), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> On the inlet side, a sampling device and optional temperature  grid (sections 2.5 and 2.5.2).</p><p class="depth0">c. During the preliminary tests described in sections 3.11.1 and  3.11.1.1, measure the evaporator and condenser temperatures or  pressures. On both the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, solder a  thermocouple onto a return bend located at or near the midpoint of each  coil or at points not affected by vapor superheat or liquid subcooling.  Alternatively, if the test unit is not sensitive to the refrigerant  charge, connect pressure gages to the access valves or to ports created  from tapping into the suction and discharge lines. Use this alternative  approach when testing a unit charged with a zeotropic refrigerant having  a temperature glide in excess of 1 [deg]F at the specified test  conditions.</p><p class="depth0">2.10.2 Compressor Calibration Method. Measure refrigerant pressures  and temperatures to determine the evaporator superheat and the enthalpy  of the refrigerant that enters and exits the indoor coil. Determine  refrigerant flow rate or, when the superheat of the refrigerant leaving  the evaporator is less than 5 [deg]F, total capacity from separate  calibration tests conducted under identical operating conditions. When  using this method, install instrumentation, measure refrigerant  properties, and adjust the refrigerant charge according to section 7.4.2  of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  430.22). Use refrigerant temperature and pressure measuring instruments  that meet the specifications given in sections 5.1.1 and 5.2 of ASHRAE  Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22).</p><p class="depth0">2.10.3 Refrigerant Enthalpy Method. For this method, calculate space  conditioning capacity by determining the refrigerant enthalpy change for  the indoor coil and directly measuring the refrigerant flow rate. Use  section 7.5.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 430.22) for the requirements for this method, including the  additional instrumentation requirements, and information on placing the  flow meter and a sight glass. Use refrigerant temperature, pressure, and  flow measuring instruments that meet the specifications given in  sections 5.1.1, 5.2, and 5.5.1 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated  by reference, see Sec. 430.22).</p><p class="depth0">2.11 Measurement of test room ambient conditions. a. If using a test  set-up where air is ducted directly from the conditioning apparatus to  the indoor coil inlet (see Figure 2, Loop Air-Enthalpy Test Method  Arrangement, of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 430.22)), add instrumentation to permit measurement of the indoor  test room dry-bulb temperature.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method is not used, add  instrumentation to measure the dry-bulb temperature and the water vapor  content of the air entering the outdoor coil. If an air sampling device  is used, construct and apply the device as per section 6 of ASHRAE  Standard 41.1-86 (RA 01) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22).  Take steps (e.g., add or re-position a lab circulating fan), as needed,  to minimize the magnitude of the temperature distribution non- uniformity. Position any fan in the outdoor test room while trying to  keep air velocities in the vicinity of the test unit below 500 feet per  minute.</p><p class="depth0">c. Measure dry bulb temperatures as specified in sections 4, 5, 6.1- 6.10, 9, 10, and 11 of ASHRAE Standard 41.1-86 (RA 01) (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 430.22). Measure water vapor content as stated  above in section 2.5.6.</p><p class="depth0">2.12 Measurement of indoor fan speed.

Determine the average  barometric pressure during each test. Use an instrument that meets the  requirements specified in section 5.2 of ASHRAE Standard 37- 2005(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22).</p><p class="depth0">3. Testing Procedures</p><p class="depth0">3.1 General Requirements. If, during the testing process, an  equipment set-up adjustment is made that would alter the performance of  the unit when conducting an already completed test, then repeat all  tests affected by the adjustment. For cyclic tests, instead of  maintaining an air volume rate, for each airflow nozzle, maintain the  static pressure difference or velocity pressure during an ON period at  the same pressure difference or velocity pressure as measured during the  steady-state test conducted at the same test conditions.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Primary and secondary test methods. For all tests, use the  Indoor Air Enthalpy Method test apparatus to determine the unit's space  conditioning capacity. The procedure and data collected, however, differ  slightly depending upon whether the test is a steady-state test, a  cyclic test, or a frost accumulation test. The following sections  described these differences. For all steady-state tests (i.e., the A,  A2, A1, B, B2, B1, C,  C1, EV, F1, G1, H01,  H1, H12, H11, HIN,  H3, H32, and H31 Tests), in addition,  use one of the acceptable secondary methods specified in section 2.10 to  determine indoor space conditioning capacity. Calculate this secondary  check of capacity according to section 3.11. The two capacity  measurements must agree to within 6 percent to constitute a valid test.  For this capacity comparison, use the Indoor Air Enthalpy Method  capacity that is calculated in section 7.3 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) (and, if testing a coil- only unit, do not make the after-test fan heat adjustments described in  section 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, and 3.10 of this appendix). However, include the  appropriate section 3.3 to 3.5 and 3.7 to 3.10 fan heat adjustments  within the Indoor Air Enthalpy Method capacities used for the section 4  seasonal calculations.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2 Manufacturer-provided equipment overrides. Where needed, the  manufacturer must provide a means for overriding the controls of the  test unit so that the compressor(s) operates at the specified speed or  capacity and the indoor fan operates at the specified speed or delivers  the specified air volume rate.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.3 Airflow through the outdoor coil. For all tests, meet the  requirements given in section 6.1.3.4 of ARI Standard 210/240- 2006(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.22) when obtaining the  airflow through the outdoor coil.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.4 Airflow through the indoor coil.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.4.1 Cooling Full-load Air Volume Rate.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.4.1.1 Cooling Full-Load Air Volume Rate for Ducted Units. The  manufacturer must specify the Cooling Full-load Air Volume Rate. Use  this value as long as the following two requirements are satisfied.  First, when conducting the A or A2 Test (exclusively), the  measured air volume rate, when divided by the measured indoor air-side  total cooling capacity must not exceed 37.5 cubic feet per minute of  standard air (scfm) per 1000 Btu/h. If this ratio is exceeded, reduce  the air volume rate until this ratio is equaled. Use this reduced air  volume rate for all tests that call for using the Cooling Full-load Air  Volume Rate. The second requirement is as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. For all ducted units tested with an indoor fan installed, except  those having a variable-speed, constant-air-volume-rate indoor fan. The  second requirement applies exclusively to the A or A2 Test  and is met as follows.</p><p class="depth0">1. Achieve the Cooling Full-load Air Volume Rate, determined in  accordance with the previous paragraph;</p><p class="depth0">2. Measure the external static pressure;</p><p class="depth0">3. If this pressure is equal to or greater than the applicable  minimum external static pressure cited in Table 2, this second  requirement is satisfied.

If the Table 2 minimum is not equaled or exceeded,</p><p class="depth0">4a. reduce the air volume rate until the applicable Table 2 minimum  is equaled or</p><p class="depth0">4b. until the measured air volume rate equals 95 percent of the air  volume rate from step 1, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth0">5. If the conditions of step 4a occur first, this second requirement  is satisfied.

If the conditions of step 4b occur first, make an incremental  change to the set-up of the indoor fan (e.g., next highest fan motor pin  setting, next highest fan motor speed) and repeat the evaluation process  beginning at above step 1. If the indoor fan set-up cannot be further  changed, reduce the air volume rate until the applicable Table 2 minimum  is equaled. Use this reduced air volume rate for all tests that require  the Cooling Full-load Air Volume Rate.</p><p class="depth0">b.

For ducted units that are tested without an indoor fan installed.  For the A or A2 Test, (exclusively), the pressure drop across  the indoor coil assembly must not exceed 0.30 inches of water. If this  pressure drop is exceeded, reduce the air volume rate until the measured  pressure drop equals the specified maximum. Use this reduced air volume  rate for all tests that require the Cooling Full-loadAir Volume Rate.

For  ducted two-capacity heating-only heat pumps that are tested without an  indoor fan installed, the Heating Minimum Air Volume Rate is the higher  of the rate specified by the manufacturer or 75 percent of the Heating  Full-load Air Volume Rate.

For ducted heating-only heat pumps, conduct the H1 or  H12 Test first to establish the Heating Full-load Air Volume  Rate. When conducting an optional cyclic test, always conduct it  immediately after the steady-state test that requires the same test  conditions. For variable-speed systems, the first test using the Cooling  Minimum Air Volume Rate should precede the EV Test if one  expects to adjust the indoor fan control options when preparing for the  first Minimum Air Volume Rate test.

Except for the modifications noted in this section, conduct the  steady-state dry coil cooling mode tests as specified in section 3.3 for  wet coil tests. Prior to recording data during the steady-state dry coil  test, operate the unit at least one hour after achieving dry coil  conditions. Drain the drain pan and plug the drain opening. Thereafter,  the drain pan should remain completely dry.</p><p class="depth0">b. Denote the resulting total space cooling capacity and electrical  power derived from the test as QQss,dry and  EEss,dry. With regard to a section 3.3 deviation, do not  adjust QQss,dry for duct losses (i.e., do not apply section  7.3.3.3 of ASHRAE Standard 37-2005 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  430.22)). In preparing for the section 3.5 cyclic tests, record the  average indoor-side air volume rate, VV, specific heat of the air, Cp,a  (expressed on dry air basis), specific volume of the air at the nozzles,  v[min]n, humidity ratio at the nozzles, Wn, and  either pressure difference or velocity   pressure for the flow nozzles. For units having a variable-speed indoor  fan (that provides either a constant or variable air volume rate) that  will or may be tested during the cyclic dry coil cooling mode test with  the indoor fan turned off (see section 3.5), include the electrical  power used by the indoor fan motor among the recorded parameters from  the 30-minute test.</p><p class="depth0">3.5 Test procedures for the optional cyclic dry-coil cooling-mode  tests (the D, D1, D2, and I1 Tests). a.  After completing the steady-state dry-coil test, remove the Outdoor Air  Enthalpy method test apparatus, if connected, and begin manual OFF/ON  cycling of the unit's compressor. The test set-up should otherwise be  identical to the set-up used during the steady-state dry coil test. When  testing heat pumps, leave the reversing valve during the compressor OFF  cycles in the same position as used for the compressor ON cycles, unless  automatically changed by the controls of the unit. For units having a  variable-speed indoor fan, the manufacturer has the option of electing  at the outset whether to conduct the cyclic test with the indoor fan  enabled or disabled. Always revert to testing with the indoor fan  disabled if cyclic testing with the fan enabled is unsuccessful.</p><p class="depth0">b. For units having a single-speed or two-capacity compressor, cycle  the compressor OFF for 24 minutes and then ON for 6 minutes  ([Delta][tau]cyc,dry = 0.5 hours). For units having a  variable-speed compressor, cycle the compressor OFF for 48 minutes and  then ON for 12 minutes ([Delta][tau]cyc,dry = 1.0 hours).  Repeat the OFF/ON compressor cycling pattern until the test is  completed. Allow the controls of the unit to regulate cycling of the  outdoor fan.</p><p class="depth0">c. Sections 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 specify airflow requirements through the  indoor coil of ducted and non-ducted systems, respectively. In all  cases, use the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus (covered  under section 2.6) along with the indoor fan of the unit, if installed  and operating, to approximate a step response in the indoor coil  airflow. Regulate the exhaust fan to quickly obtain and then maintain  the flow nozzle static pressure difference or velocity pressure at the  same value as was measured during the steady-state dry coil test. The  pressure difference or velocity pressure should be within 2 percent of  the value from the steady-state dry coil test within 15 seconds after  airflow initiation. For units having a variable-speed indoor fan that  ramps when cycling on and/or off, use the exhaust fan of the airflow  measuring apparatus to impose a step response that begins at the  initiation of ramp up and ends at the termination of ramp down.</p><p class="depth0">d. For units having a variable-speed indoor fan, conduct the cyclic  dry coil test using the pull-thru approach described below if any of the  following occur when testing with the fan operating:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The test unit automatically cycles off;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Its blower motor reverses; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The unit operates for more than 30 seconds at an external static  pressure that is 0.1 inches of water or more higher than the value  measured during the prior steady-state test.</p><p class="depth0">For the pull-thru approach, disable the indoor fan and use the  exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus to generate the specified  flow nozzles static pressure difference or velocity pressure. If the  exhaust fan cannot deliver the required pressure difference because of  resistance created by the unpowered blower, temporarily remove the  blower.</p><p class="depth0">e. After completing a minimum of two complete compressor OFF/ON  cycles, determine the overall cooling delivered and total electrical  energy consumption during any subsequent data collection interval where  the test tolerances given in Table 8 are satisfied. If available, use  electric resistance heaters (see section 2.1) to minimize the variation  in the inlet air temperature.</p><p class="depth0">f. With regard to the Table 8 parameters, continuously record the  dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor and outdoor coils  during periods when air flows through the respective coils. Sample the  water vapor content of the indoor coil inlet air at least every 2  minutes during periods when air flows through the coil. Record external  static pressure and the air volume rate indicator (either nozzle  pressure difference or velocity pressure) at least every minute during  the interval that air flows through the indoor coil. (These regular  measurements of the airflow rate indicator are in addition to the  required measurement at 15 seconds after flow initiation.) Sample the  electrical voltage at least every 2 minutes beginning 30 seconds after  compressor start-up. Continue until the compressor, the outdoor fan, and  the indoor fan (if it is installed and operating) cycle off.</p><p class="depth0">g. For ducted units, continuously record the dry-bulb temperature of  the air entering (as noted above) and leaving the indoor coil. Or if  using a thermopile, continuously record the difference between these two  temperatures during the interval that air flows through the indoor coil.  For non-ducted units, make the same dry-bulb temperature measurements  beginning when the compressor cycles on and ending when indoor coil  airflow ceases.</p><p class="depth0">h. Integrate the electrical power over complete cycles of length  [Delta][tau]cyc,dry. For ducted units tested with an indoor  fan installed and operating, integrate electrical power from indoor fan  OFF to indoor fan OFF. For all other ducted units and for non-ducted  units, integrate electrical power from compressor OFF to compressor OFF.  (Some cyclic tests will use the same data collection intervals to  determine the electrical energy and the total   space cooling. For other units, terminate data collection used to  determine the electrical energy before terminating data collection used  to determine total space cooling.)</p><p class="depth0">Table 8--Test Operating and Test Condition Tolerances for Cyclic Dry</p><p class="depth0">Coil Cooling Mode Tests ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Test          Test</p><p class="depth0">Operating     Condition</p><p class="depth0">Tolerance     Tolerance</p><p class="depth0">\1\           \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Indoor entering dry-bulb temperature \3\,             2.0            0.5</p><p class="depth0">[deg]F.....................................

The automatic controls  that are normally installed with the test unit must govern the OFF/ON  cycling of the air moving equipment on the indoor side (exhaust fan of  the airflow measuring apparatus and, if installed, the indoor fan of the  test unit). For example, for ducted units tested without an indoor fan  installed but rated based on using a fan time delay relay, control the  indoor coil airflow according to the rated ON and/or OFF delays provided  by the relay. For ducted units having a variable-speed indoor fan that  has been disabled (and possibly removed), start and stop the indoor  airflow at the same instances as if the fan were enabled. For all other  ducted units tested without an indoor fan installed, cycle the indoor  coil airflow in unison with the cycling of the compressor. Close air  dampers on the inlet (section 2.5.1) and outlet side (sections 2.5 and  2.5.4) during the OFF period. Airflow through the indoor coil should  stop within 3 seconds after the automatic controls of the test unit (act  to) de-energize the indoor fan. For ducted units tested without an  indoor fan installed (excluding the special case where a variable-speed  fan is temporarily removed), increase ecyc,dry by the  quantity, [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.020  and decrease qcyc,dry by, [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC05.021  where VVs is the average indoor air volume rate from the</p><p class="depth0">section 3.4 dry coil steady-state test and is expressed in</p><p class="depth0">units of cubic feet per minute of standard air (scfm).

The following algorithm if the indoor fan ramps its speed when  cycling.</p><p class="depth0">1. Measure the electrical power consumed by the variable-speed  indoor fan at a minimum of three operating conditions: at the speed/air  volume rate/external static pressure that was measured during the  steady-state test, at operating conditions associated with the midpoint  of the ramp-up interval,   and at conditions associated with the midpoint of the ramp-down  interval. For these measurements, the tolerances on the airflow volume  or the external static pressure are the same as required for the section  3.4 steady-state test.</p><p class="depth0">2. For each case, determine the fan power from measurements made  over a minimum of 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth0">3. Approximate the electrical energy consumption of the indoor fan  if it had operated during the cyclic test using all three power  measurements. Assume a linear profile during the ramp intervals. The  manufacturer must provide the durations of the ramp-up and ramp-down  intervals. If a manufacturer-supplied ramp interval exceeds 45 seconds,  use a 45-second ramp interval nonetheless when estimating the fan  energy.</p><p class="depth0">The manufacturer is allowed to choose option a, and forego the extra  testing burden of option b, even if the unit ramps indoor fan speed when  cycling.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2 Procedures when testing non-ducted systems. Do not use air  dampers when conducting cyclic tests on non-ducted units. Until the last  OFF/ON compressor cycle, airflow through the indoor coil must cycle off  and on in unison with the compressor. For the last OFF/ON compressor  cycle--the one used to determine ecyc,dry and  qcyc,dry--use the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring  apparatus and the indoor fan of the test unit to have indoor airflow  start 3 minutes prior to compressor cut-on and end three minutes after  compressor cutoff. Subtract the electrical energy used by the indoor fan  during the 3 minutes prior to compressor cut-on from the integrated  electrical energy, ecyc,dry. Add the electrical energy used  by the indoor fan during the 3 minutes after compressor cutoff to the  integrated cooling capacity, qcyc,dry. For the case where the  non-ducted unit uses a variable-speed indoor fan which is disabled  during the cyclic test, correct ecyc,dry and  qcyc,dry using the same approach as prescribed in section  3.5.1 for ducted units having a disabled variable-speed indoor fan.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.3 Cooling-mode cyclic-degradation coefficient calculation.

For heat pumps containing defrost controls which are likely to  cause defrosts at intervals less than one hour, the preliminary test  period starts at the termination of an automatic defrost cycle and ends  at the termination of the next occurring automatic defrost cycle. For  heat pumps containing defrost controls which are likely to cause  defrosts at intervals exceeding one hour, the preliminary test period  must consist of a heating interval lasting at least one hour followed by  a defrost cycle that is either manually or automatically initiated. In  all cases, the heat pump's own controls must govern when a defrost cycle  terminates.</p><p class="depth0">c. The official test period begins when the preliminary test period  ends, at defrost termination. The official test period ends at the  termination of the next occurring automatic defrost cycle.

Evaluate compliance with Table 15 test condition  tolerances and the majority of the test operating tolerances using the  averages from measurements recorded only during Sub-interval H.  Continuously record the dry bulb temperature of the air entering the  indoor coil, and the dry bulb temperature and water vapor content of the  air entering the outdoor coil. Sample the remaining parameters listed in  Table 15 at equal intervals that span 10 minutes or less.</p><p class="depth0">f.

For forced air central furnaces, the circulating air blower  compartment is considered as part of the duct system and no surface  temperature measurement of the blower compartment needs to be recorded  for the purpose of this test. For downflow furnaces, measure all cabinet  surface temperatures of the heat exchanger and combustion section,  including the bottom around the outlet duct, and the burner door, using  the 36 square-inch thermocouple grid. The cabinet surface temperatures  around the blower section do not need to be measured (See figure 3-E of  ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1993.)</p><p class="depth0">8.0 Test procedure.

For burners equipped with  an interrupted ignition device, record the nameplate electric power used  by the ignition device, PEIG, or use PEIG = 0.4 kW  if no nameplate power input is provided. Record the nameplate ignition  device on-time interval, tIG, or measure the on-time period  at the beginning of the test at the time the burner is turned on with a  stop watch, if no nameplate value is given. Set tIG = 0 and  PEIG = 0 if the device on-time is less than or equal to 5  seconds after the burner is on.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Gas- and oil-fueled gravity and forced air central furnaces  without stack dampers cool-down test. Turn off the main burner after  steady-state testing is completed, and measure the flue gas temperature  by means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ANSI/ ASHRAE 103-1993 at 1.5 minutes (TF,OFF(t3)) and 9  minutes (TF,OFF(t4)) after the burner shuts off.  An integral draft diverter shall remain blocked and insulated, and the  stack restriction shall remain in place. On atmospheric systems with an  integral draft diverter or draft hood, equipped with either an  electromechanical inlet damper or an electro-mechanical flue damper that  closes within 10 seconds after the burner shuts off to restrict the flow  through the heat exchanger in the off-cycle, bypass or adjust the  control for the electromechanical damper so that the damper remains open  during the cool-down test. For furnaces that employ post purge, measure  the length of the post-purge period with a stopwatch. The time from  burner OFF to combustion blower OFF (electrically de-energized) shall be  recorded as tp. For the case where tp is intended  to be greater than 180 seconds, stop the combustion blower at 180  seconds and use that value for tp. Measure the flue gas  temperature by means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6  of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-1993 at the end of post-purge period, tp  (TF,OFF(tp)), and at the time (1.5 +  tp) minutes (TF,OFF(t3)) and (9.0 +  tp) minutes (TF,OFF(t4)) after the main  burner shuts off. For the case where the measured tp is less than or  equal to 30 seconds, it shall be tested as if there is no post purge and  tp shall be set equal to 0.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 Gas- and oil-fueled gravity and forced air central furnaces  without stack dampers with adjustable fan control--cool-down test. For a  furnace with adjustable fan control, this time delay will be 3.0 minutes  for non-condensing furnaces or 1.5 minutes for condensing furnaces or  until the supply air temperature drops to a value of 40 [deg]F above the  inlet air temperature, whichever results in the longest fan on-time. For  a furnace without adjustable fan control or with the type of adjustable  fan control whose range of adjustment does not allow for the delay time  specified above, the control shall be bypassed and the fan manually  controlled to give the delay times specified above. For a furnace which  employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the indoor air  circulating blower, the power burner and indoor air circulating blower  shall be stopped together.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 Gas-and oil-fueled boilers without stack dampers cool-down test.  After steady-state testing has been completed, turn the main burner(s)  OFF and measure the flue gas temperature at 3.75  (TF,OFF(t3)) and 22.5  (TF,OFF(t4)) minutes after the burner shut off,  using the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103- 1993. During this off-period, for units that do not have pump delay  after shutoff, no water shall be allowed to circulate through the hot  water boilers. For units that have pump delay on shutoff, except those  having pump controls sensing water temperature, the pump shall be  stopped by the unit control and the time t\+\, between burner shutoff  and pump shutoff shall be measured within one-second accuracy. For units  having pump delay controls that sense water temperature, the pump shall  be operated for 15 minutes and t\+\ shall be 15 minutes. While the pump  is operating, the inlet water temperature and flow rate shall be  maintained at the same values as used during the steady-state test as  specified in sections 9.1 and 8.4.2.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 103-1993.</p><p class="depth0">For boilers that employ post purge, measure the length of the post- purge period with a stopwatch. The time from burner OFF to combustion  blower OFF (electrically de-energized) shall be recorded as  tP. For the case where tP is intended to be  greater than 180 seconds, stop the combustion blower at 180 seconds and  use that value for tP. Measure the flue gas temperature by  means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ANSI/ASHRAE  103-1993 at the end of the post purge period  tP(TF,OFF(tP)) and at the time (3.75 +  tP) minutes (TF,OFF(t3)) and (22.5 +  tP) minutes (TF,OFF(t4)) after the main  burner shuts off. For the case where the measured tP is less  or equal to 30 seconds, it shall be tested as if there is no post purge  and tP shall be set to equal 0.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 Direct measurement of off-cycle losses testing method.

Batch charger is a battery charger that charges two or more  identical batteries simultaneously in a series, parallel, series- parallel, or parallel-series configuration. A batch charger does not  have separate voltage or current regulation, nor does it have any  separate indicators for each battery in the batch. When testing a batch  charger, the term ``battery'' is understood to mean, collectively, all  the batteries in the batch that are charged together. A charger can be  both a batch charger and a multi-port charger or multi-voltage charger.</p><p class="depth0">2.6. Battery or battery pack is an assembly of one or more  rechargeable cells and any integral protective circuitry intended to  provide electrical energy to a consumer product, and may be in one of  the following forms: (a) Detachable battery (a battery that is contained  in a separate enclosure from the consumer product and is intended to be  removed or disconnected from the consumer product for recharging); or  (b) integral battery (a battery that is contained within the consumer  product and is not removed from the consumer product for charging  purposes). The word ``intended'' in this context refers to the whether a  battery has been designed in such a way as to permit its removal or  disconnection from its associated consumer product.</p><p class="depth0">2.7. Battery energy is the energy, in watt-hours, delivered by the  battery under the specified discharge conditions in the test procedure.</p><p class="depth0">2.8. Battery maintenance mode or maintenance mode is the mode of  operation when the battery charger is connected to the main electricity  supply and the battery is fully charged, but is still connected to the  charger.</p><p class="depth0">2.9. Battery rest period is a period of time between discharge and  charge or between charge and discharge, during which the battery is  resting in an open-circuit state in ambient air.</p><p class="depth0">2.10.

Multi-port charger means a battery charger that charges two or  more batteries (which may be identical or different) simultaneously. The  batteries are not connected in series or in parallel but with each port  having separate voltage and/or current regulation. If the charger has  status indicators,   each port has its own indicator(s). A charger can be both a batch  charger and a multi-port charger if it is capable of charging two or  more batches of batteries simultaneously and each batch has separate  regulation and/or indicator(s).</p><p class="depth0">2.17. Multi-voltage charger is a battery charger that, by design,  can charge a variety of batteries (or batches of batteries, if also a  batch charger) that are of different rated battery voltages.

Rated charge capacity is the capacity claimed by a  manufacturer, on a label or in instructions, the battery can store under  specified test conditions, usually given in ampere-hours (Ah) or  milliampere-hours (mAh) and typically printed on the label of the  battery itself. If there are multiple batteries that are connected in  parallel, the rated charge capacity of the batteries is the total charge  capacity of the parallel configuration, that is, the rated charge  capacity of each battery multiplied by the number of batteries connected  in parallel. Connecting multiple batteries in series does not affect the  rated charge capacity.</p><p class="depth0">2.21. Rated energy capacity means the product (in watt-hours) of the  rated battery voltage and the rated charge capacity.</p><p class="depth0">2.22. Standby mode or no-battery mode means the condition in which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The battery charger is connected to the main electricity supply;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The battery is not connected to the charger; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For battery chargers with manual on-off switches, all such  switches are turned on.</p><p class="depth0">2.23.

Limiting Other Non-Battery-Charger Functions</p><p class="depth0">a. If the battery charger or product containing the battery charger  does not have any additional functions unrelated to battery charging,  this subsection may be skipped.</p><p class="depth0">b. Any optional functions controlled by the user and not associated  with the battery charging process (e.g., the answering machine in a  cordless telephone charging base) shall be switched off. If it is not  possible to switch such functions off, they shall be set to their lowest  power-consuming mode during the test.</p><p class="depth0">c. If the battery charger takes any physically separate connectors  or cables not required for battery charging but associated with its  other functionality (such as phone lines, serial or USB connections,  Ethernet, cable TV lines, etc.), these connectors or cables shall be  left disconnected during the testing.</p><p class="depth0">d. Any manual on-off switches specifically associated with the  battery charging process shall be switched on for the duration of the  charge, maintenance, and no-battery mode tests, and switched off for the  off mode test.</p><p class="depth0">4.5. Accessing the Battery for the Test</p><p class="depth0">a. The technician may need to disassemble the end-use product or  battery charger to gain access to the battery terminals for the Battery  Discharge Energy Test in section 5.6. If the battery terminals are not  clearly labeled, the technician shall use a voltmeter to identify the  positive and negative terminals. These terminals will be the ones that  give the largest voltage difference and are able to deliver significant  current (0.2 C or 1/hr) into a load.</p><p class="depth0">b. All conductors used for contacting the battery must be cleaned  and burnished prior to connecting in order to decrease voltage drops and  achieve consistent results.</p><p class="depth0">c. Manufacturer's instructions for disassembly shall be followed,  except those instructions that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Lead to any permanent alteration of the battery charger  circuitry or function;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Could alter the energy consumption of the battery charger  compared to that experienced by a user during typical use, e.g., due to  changes in the airflow through the enclosure of the UUT; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Conflict requirements of this test procedure.</p><p class="depth0">d. Care shall be taken by the technician during disassembly to  follow appropriate safety precautions. If the functionality of the  device or its safety features is compromised, the product shall be  discarded after testing.</p><p class="depth0">e. Some products may include protective circuitry between the  battery cells and the remainder of the device. If the manufacturer  provides a description for accessing the connections at the output of  the protective circuitry, these connections shall be used to discharge  the battery and measure the discharge energy. The energy consumed by the  protective circuitry during discharge shall not be measured or credited  as battery energy.</p><p class="depth0">f. If the technician, despite diligent effort and use of the  manufacturer's instructions, encounters any of the following conditions   noted immediately below, the Battery Discharge Energy and the Charging  and Maintenance Mode Energy shall be reported as ``Not Applicable'':</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inability to access the battery terminals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Access to the battery terminals destroys charger functionality;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Inability to draw current from the test battery.</p><p class="depth0">4.6. Determining Charge Capacity for Batteries With No Rating</p><p class="depth0">If there is no rating for the battery charge capacity on the battery  or in the instructions, then the technician shall determine a discharge  current that meets the following requirements. The battery shall be  fully charged and then discharged at this constant-current rate until it  reaches the end-of-discharge voltage specified in Table 5.2. The  discharge time must be not less than 4.5 hours nor more than 5 hours. In  addition, the discharge test (Section 5.6) (which may not be starting  with a fully-charged battery) shall reach the end-of-discharge voltage  within 5 hours. The same discharge current shall be used for both the  preparations step (Section 5.4) and the discharge test (Section 5.6).  The test report shall include the discharge current used and the  resulting discharge times for both a fully-charged battery and for the  discharge test.</p><p class="depth0">For this section, the battery is considered as ``fully charged''  when either (a) it has been charged by the UUT until an indicator on the  UUT shows that the charge is complete, or (b) it has been charged by a  battery analyzer at a current not greater than the discharge current  until the battery analyzer indicates that the battery is fully charged.</p><p class="depth0">When there is no capacity rating, a suitable discharge current must  generally be determined by trial and error. Since the conditioning step  does not require constant-current discharges, the trials themselves may  also be counted as part of battery conditioning.</p><p class="depth0">5. Test Measurement</p><p class="depth0">The test sequence to measure the battery charger energy consumption  is summarized in Table 5.1, and explained in detail below.

Determining the Duration of the Charge and Maintenance Mode Test</p><p class="depth0">a. The charging and maintenance mode test, described in detail in  section 5.8, shall be 24 hours in length or longer, as determined by the  items below. Proceed in order until a test duration is determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the battery charger has an indicator to show that the battery  is fully charged, that indicator shall be used as follows: If the  indicator shows that the battery is charged after 19 hours of charging,  the test shall be terminated at 24 hours. Conversely, if the full-charge  indication is not yet present after 19 hours of charging, the test shall  continue until 5 hours after the indication is present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If there is no indicator, but the manufacturer's instructions  indicate that charging this battery or this capacity of battery should  be complete within 19 hours, the test shall be for 24 hours. If the  instructions indicate that charging may take longer than 19 hours, the  test shall be run for the longest estimated charge time plus 5 hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If there is no indicator and no time estimate in the  instructions, but the charging current is stated on the charger or in  the instructions, calculate the test duration as the longer of 24 hours  or: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01JN11.021</p><p class="depth0">b. If none of the above applies, the duration of the test shall be  24 hours.</p><p class="depth0">5.3. Battery Conditioning</p><p class="depth0">a. No conditioning is to be done on lead-acid or lithium-ion  batteries. The test technician shall proceed directly to battery  preparation, section 5.4, when testing chargers for these batteries.</p><p class="depth0">b. Products with integral batteries will have to be disassembled per  the instructions in section 4.5, and the battery disconnected from the  charger for discharging.</p><p class="depth0">c. Batteries of other chemistries that have not been previously  cycled are to be conditioned by performing two charges and two  discharges, followed by a charge, as below. No data need be recorded  during battery conditioning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The test battery shall be fully charged for the duration  specified in section 5.2 or longer using the UUT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The test battery shall then be fully discharged using either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A battery analyzer at a rate not to exceed 1 C, until its  average cell voltage under load reaches the end-of-discharge voltage  specified in Table 5.2 for the relevant battery chemistry; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The UUT, until the UUT ceases operation due to low battery  voltage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The test battery shall again be fully charged as in step c.(1)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The test battery shall again be fully discharged as per step  c.(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The test battery shall be again fully charged as in step c.(1)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0">d. Batteries of chemistries other than lead-acid or lithium-ion that  are known to have been through at least two previous full charge/ discharge cycles shall only be charged once per step c.(5), of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">5.4. Preparing the Battery for Charge Testing</p><p class="depth0">Following any conditioning prior to beginning the battery charge  test (section 5.6), the test battery shall be fully discharged for the  duration specified in section 5.2 or longer using a battery analyzer.</p><p class="depth0">5.5. Resting the Battery</p><p class="depth0">The test battery shall be rested between preparation and the battery  charge test. The rest period shall be at least one hour and not exceed  24 hours. For batteries with flooded cells, the electrolyte temperature  shall be less than 30 [deg]C before charging, even if the rest period  must be extended longer than 24 hours.</p><p class="depth0">5.6. Testing Charge Mode and Battery Maintenance Mode</p><p class="depth0">a. The Charge and Battery Maintenance Mode test measures the energy  consumed during charge mode and some time spent in the maintenance mode  of the UUT. Functions required for battery conditioning that happen only  with some user-selected switch or other control shall not be included in  this measurement. (The technician shall manually turn off any battery  conditioning cycle or setting.) Regularly occurring battery conditioning  or maintenance functions that are not controlled by the user will, by  default, be incorporated into this measurement.</p><p class="depth0">b. During the measurement period, input power values to the UUT  shall be recorded at least once every minute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If possible, the technician shall set the data logging system to  record the average power during the sample interval. The total energy is  computed as the sum of power samples (in watts) multiplied by the sample  interval (in hours).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If this setting is not possible, then the power analyzer shall  be set to integrate or accumulate the input power over the measurement  period and this result shall be used as the total energy.</p><p class="depth0">c. The technician shall follow these steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ensure that the user-controllable device functionality not  associated with battery charging and any battery conditioning cycle or  setting are turned off, as instructed in section 4.4;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ensure that the test battery used in this test has been  conditioned, prepared, discharged, and rested as described in sections  5.3 through 5.7;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Connect the data logging equipment to the battery charger;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Record the start time of the measurement period, and begin  logging the input power;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Connect the test battery to the battery charger within 3 minutes  of beginning logging. For integral battery products, connect the product  to a cradle or wall adapter within 3 minutes of beginning logging;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> After the test battery is connected, record the initial time and  power (W) of the input current to the UUT. These measurements shall be  taken within the first 10 minutes of active charging;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Record the input power for the duration of the ``Charging and  Maintenance Mode Test'' period, as determined by section 5.2. The actual  time that power is connected to the UUT shall be within 5 minutes of the specified period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Disconnect power to the UUT, terminate data logging, and record  the final time.</p><p class="depth0">5.7. Resting the Battery</p><p class="depth0">The test battery shall be rested between charging and discharging.  The rest period shall be at least 1 hour and not more than 4 hours, with  an exception for flooded cells. For batteries with flooded cells, the  electrolyte temperature shall be less than 30 [deg]C before charging,  even if the rest period must be extended beyond 4 hours.</p><p class="depth0">5.8. Battery Discharge Energy Test</p><p class="depth0">a. If multiple batteries were charged simultaneously, the discharge  energy is the sum of the discharge energies of all the batteries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a multi-port charger, batteries that were charged in  separate ports shall be discharged independently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a batch charger, batteries that were charged as a group may  be discharged individually, as a group, or in sub-groups connected in  series and/or parallel. The position of each battery with respect to the  other batteries need not be maintained.</p><p class="depth0">b. During discharge, the battery voltage and discharge current shall  be sampled and recorded at least once per minute. The values recorded  may be average or instantaneous values.</p><p class="depth0">c. For this test, the technician shall follow these steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ensure that the test battery has been charged by the UUT and  rested according to the procedures above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Set the battery analyzer for a constant discharge current of 0.2  [deg]C and the end-of-discharge voltage in Table 5.2 for the relevant  battery chemistry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Connect the test battery to the analyzer and begin recording the  voltage, current, and wattage, if available from the battery analyzer.  When the end-of-discharge voltage is reached or the UUT circuitry  terminates the discharge, the test battery shall be returned to an open- circuit condition. If current continues to be drawn from the test  battery after the end-of-discharge condition is first reached, this  additional energy is not to be counted in the battery discharge energy.</p><p class="depth0">d. If not available from the battery analyzer, the battery discharge  energy (in watt-hours) is calculated by multiplying the voltage (in  volts), current (in amperes), and sample period (in hours) for each  sample, and then summing over all sample periods until the end-of- discharge voltage is reached.</p><p class="depth0">5.9. Determining the Maintenance Mode Power</p><p class="depth0">After the measurement period is complete, the technician shall  determine the average maintenance mode power consumption by examining  the power-versus-time data from the charge and maintenance test and:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the maintenance mode power is cyclic or shows periodic  pulses, compute the average power over a time period that spans a whole  number of cycles and includes at least the last 4 hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Otherwise, calculate the average power value over the last 4  hours.</p><p class="depth0">5.10. Determining the 24-Hour Energy Consumption</p><p class="depth0">The accumulated energy or the average input power, integrated over  the test period from the charge and maintenance mode test, shall be used  to calculate 24-hour energy consumption.

Standby Mode Energy Consumption Measurement</p><p class="depth0">The standby mode measurement depends on the configuration of the  battery charger, as follows.</p><p class="depth0">a. Conduct a measurement of standby power consumption while the  battery charger is connected to the power source. Disconnect the battery  from the charger, allow the charger to operate for at least 30 minutes,  and record the power (i.e., watts) consumed as the time series integral  of the power consumed over a 10-minute test period, divided by the  period of measurement. If the battery charger has manual on-off  switches, all must be turned on for the duration of the standby mode  test.</p><p class="depth0">b. Standby mode may also apply to products with integral batteries.  If the product uses a cradle and/or adapter for power conversion and  charging, then ``disconnecting the battery from the charger'' will  require disconnection of the end-use product, which contains the  batteries. The other enclosures of the battery charging system will  remain connected to the main electricity supply, and standby mode power  consumption will equal that of the cradle and/or adapter alone.</p><p class="depth0">c. If the product is powered through a detachable AC power cord and  contains integrated power conversion and charging circuitry, then only  the cord will remain connected to mains, and standby mode power  consumption will equal that of the AC power cord (i.e., zero watts).</p><p class="depth0">d. Finally, if the product contains integrated power conversion and  charging circuitry but is powered through a non-detachable AC power cord  or plug blades, then no part of the system will remain connected to  mains, and standby mode measurement is not applicable.</p><p class="depth0">5.12. Off Mode Energy Consumption Measurement</p><p class="depth0">The off mode measurement depends on the configuration of the battery  charger, as follows.</p><p class="depth0">a. If the battery charger has manual on-off switches, record a  measurement of off mode energy consumption while the battery charger is  connected to the power source. Remove the battery from the charger,  allow the charger to operate for at least 30 minutes, and record the  power (i.e., watts) consumed as the time series integral of the power  consumed over a 10-minute test period, divided by the period of  measurement, with all manual on-off switches turned off. If the battery  charger does not have manual on-off switches, record that the off mode  measurement is not applicable to this product.</p><p class="depth0">b. Off mode may also apply to products with integral batteries. If  the product uses a cradle and/or adapter for power conversion and  charging, then ``disconnecting the battery from the charger'' will  require disconnection of the end-use product, which contains the  batteries. The other enclosures of the battery charging system will  remain connected to the main electricity supply, and off mode power  consumption will equal that of the cradle and/or adapter alone.</p><p class="depth0">c.

The ambient temperature  shall be maintained at 20 [deg]C 5 [deg]C  throughout the test. There shall be no intentional cooling of the UUT  such as by use of separately powered fans, air conditioners, or heat  sinks. The UUT shall be conditioned, rested, and tested on a thermally  non-conductive surface. A readily available material such as Styrofoam  will be sufficient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Verifying the UUT's Input Voltage and Input Frequency</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the UUT is intended for operation on AC line-voltage input in  the United States, it shall be tested at 115 V at 60 Hz. If the UUT is  intended for operation on AC line-voltage input but cannot be operated  at 115 V at 60 Hz, it shall not be tested. The input voltage shall be  within 1 percent of the above specified voltage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the input voltage is AC, the input frequency shall be within  1 percent of the specified frequency. The THD of  the input voltage shall be <=2 percent, up to and including the 13th  harmonic. The crest factor of the input voltage shall be between 1.34  and 1.49.</p><p class="depth0">4. Test Measurement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Single-Voltage External Power Supply</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Standby Mode and Active Mode Measurement--The measurement of  standby mode (also no-load mode) energy consumption and active mode  efficiency shall conform to the requirements specified in section 5,  ``Measurement Approach'' of the CEC's ``Test Method for Calculating the  Energy Efficiency of Single-Voltage External Ac-Dc and Ac-Ac Power  Supplies,'' August 11, 2004, (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  430.3). Switch-selectable single-voltage external power supplies shall  be tested twice--once at the highest nameplate output voltage and once  at the lowest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the product has more than two output wires, including those  that are necessary for controlling the product, the manufacturer shall  supply a connection diagram or test fixture that will allow the testing  laboratory to put the unit under test into active mode.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For those external power supplies that cannot sustain output at  100 percent loading condition, this efficiency metric shall not be  included. For these external power supplies, the average efficiency is  the average of the efficiencies measured at 25 percent, 50 percent, and  75 percent of maximum load.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case where the external power supply lists both an  instantaneous and continuous output current, it shall be tested at the  continuous condition only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Off-Mode Measurement--If the external power supply unit under  test incorporates manual on-off switches, the unit under test shall be  placed in off mode, and its power consumption in off mode measured and  recorded. The measurement of the off mode energy consumption shall  conform to the requirements specified in section 5, ``Measurement  Approach,'' of the CEC's ``Test Method for Calculating the Energy  Efficiency of Single-Voltage External Ac-Dc and Ac-Ac Power Supplies,''  August 11, 2004 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 430.3), with two  exceptions. In section 5.a, ``Preparing UUT [Unit Under Test] for  Test,'' all manual on-off switches shall be placed in the ``off''  position for the measurement. In section 5.d, ``Testing Sequence,'' the  technician shall consider the UUT stable if, over 5 minutes with samples  taken at least once every second, the AC input power does not drift from  the maximum value observed by more than 1 percent or 50 milliwatts,  whichever is greater. The only loading condition that will be measured  for off mode is ``Load Condition 5'' in Table 1 of the CEC's test  procedure. Switch-selectable single-voltage external power supplies  shall have their off mode power consumption measured twice-- once at the  highest nameplate output voltage and once at the lowest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Multiple-Voltage External Power Supply--Power supplies must be  tested with the output cord packaged with the unit for sale to the  consumer, as it is considered part of the unit under test. There are two  options for connecting metering equipment to the output of this type of  power supply: cut the cord immediately adjacent to the output connector  or attach leads and measure the efficiency from the output connector  itself. If the power supply is attached directly to the product that it  is powering, cut the cord immediately adjacent to the powered product  and connect output measurement probes at that point. The tests should be  conducted on the sets of output wires that constitute the output busses.  If the product has additional wires, these should be left electrically  disconnected unless they are necessary for controlling the product. In  this case, the manufacturer shall supply a connection diagram or test  fixture that will allow the testing laboratory to put the unit under  test into active mode.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Standby-Mode and Active-Mode Measurement--The measurement of the  multiple-voltage external power supply standby mode (also no-load-mode)  energy consumption and active-mode efficiency shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Loading conditions and testing sequence. (1) If the unit under  test has on-off switches, all switches shall be placed in the ``on''  position. Loading criteria for multiple-voltage external power supplies  shall be based on nameplate output current and not on nameplate output  power because output voltage might not remain constant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The unit under test shall operate at 100 percent of nameplate  current output for at least 30 minutes immediately before conducting  efficiency measurements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> After this warm-up period, the technician shall monitor AC input  power for a period of 5 minutes to assess the stability of the unit  under test. If the power level does not drift by more than 1 percent  from the maximum value observed, the unit under test can be considered  stable and measurements can be recorded at the end of the 5-minute  period. Measurements at subsequent loading conditions, listed in Table  1, can then be conducted under the same 5-minute stability guidelines.  Only one warm-up period of 30 minutes is required for each unit under  test at the beginning of the test procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If AC input power is not stable over a 5-minute period, the  technician shall follow the guidelines established by IEC Standard 62301  for measuring average power or accumulated energy over time for both  input and output. (Reference for guidance only, see Sec. 430.4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The unit under test shall be tested at the loading conditions  listed in Table 1, derated per the proportional allocation method  presented in the following section.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Loading Conditions for Unit Under Test ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">------------------------------------------------------------------------ Loading Condition 1.......................  100% of Derated Nameplate</p><p class="depth0">Output Current 2%. Loading Condition 2.......................  75% of Derated Nameplate</p><p class="depth0">Output Current 2%. Loading Condition 3.......................  50% of Derated Nameplate</p><p class="depth0">Output Current 2%. Loading Condition 4.......................  25% of Derated Nameplate</p><p class="depth0">Output Current 2%. Loading Condition 5.......................  0%. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Input and output power measurements shall be conducted in  sequence from Loading Condition 1 to Loading Condition 4, as indicated  in Table 1. For Loading Condition 5, the unit under test shall be placed  in no-load mode, any additional signal connections to the unit under  test shall be disconnected, and input power shall be measured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Proportional allocation method for loading multiple-voltage  external power supplies. For power supplies with multiple voltage  busses, defining consistent loading criteria is difficult because each  bus has its own nameplate output current. The sum of the power  dissipated by each bus loaded to its nameplate output current may exceed  the overall nameplate output power of the power supply. The following  proportional allocation method must be used to provide consistent  loading conditions for multiple-voltage external power supplies. For  additional explanation, please refer to section 6.1.1 of the California  Energy Commission's ``Proposed Test Protocol for Calculating the Energy  Efficiency of Internal Ac-Dc Power Supplies Revision 6.2,'' November  2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Consider a multiple-voltage power supply with N output busses,  and nameplate output voltages V1, * * *, VN, corresponding output  current ratings I1, * * *, IN, and a nameplate output power P. Calculate  the derating factor D by dividing the power supply nameplate output  power P by the sum of the nameplate output powers of the individual  output busses, equal to the product of bus nameplate output voltage and  current IiVi, as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01JN11.023</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If D =1, then loading every bus to its nameplate  output current does not exceed the overall nameplate output power for  the power supply. In this case, each output bus will simply be loaded to  the percentages of its nameplate output current listed in Table 1.  However, if D <1, it is an indication that loading each bus to its  nameplate output current will exceed the overall nameplate output power  for the power supply. In this case, and at each loading condition, each   output bus will be loaded to the appropriate percentage of its nameplate  output current listed in Table 1, multiplied by the derating factor D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Minimum output current requirements. Depending on their  application, some multiple-voltage power supplies may require a minimum  output current for each output bus of the power supply for correct  operation. In these cases, ensure that the load current for each output  at Loading Condition 4 in Table 1 is greater than the minimum output  current requirement. Thus, if the test method's calculated load current  for a given voltage bus is smaller than the minimum output current  requirement, the minimum output current must be used to load the bus.  This load current shall be properly recorded in any test report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Test loads. Active loads such as electronic loads or passive  loads such as rheostats used for efficiency testing of the unit under  test shall be able to maintain the required current loading set point  for each output voltage within an accuracy of 0.5  percent. If electronic load banks are used, their settings should be  adjusted such that they provide a constant current load to the unit  under test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Efficiency calculation. Efficiency shall be calculated by  dividing the measured active output power of the unit under test at a  given loading condition by the active AC input power measured at that  loading condition. Efficiency shall be calculated at each Loading  Condition (1, 2, 3, and 4, in Table 1) and be recorded separately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Power consumption calculation. Power consumption of the unit  under test at Loading Conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4 is the difference  between the active output power at that Loading Condition and the active  AC input power at that Loading Condition. The power consumption of  Loading Condition 5 (no-load) is equal to the AC active input power at  that Loading Condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Off Mode Measurement--If the multiple-voltage external power  supply unit under test incorporates any on-off switches, the unit under  test shall be placed in off mode and its power consumption in off mode  measured and recorded. The measurement of the off mode energy  consumption shall conform to the requirements specified in paragraph  (4)(b)(i) of this appendix. Note that the only loading condition that  will be measured for off mode is ``Loading Condition 5'' in paragraph  (A), ``Loading conditions and testing sequence'', except that all manual  on-off switches shall be placed in the off position for the measurement.

The 36-square-inch areas shall be recorded in groups where  the temperature differential of the 36-square-inch area is less than 10  [deg]F for temperature up to 100 [deg]F above room temperature and less  than 20 [deg]F for temperature more than 100 [deg]F above room  temperature. For forced air central furnaces, the circulating air blower  compartment is considered as part of the duct system and no surface  temperature measurement of the blower compartment needs to be recorded  for the purpose of this test. For downflow furnaces, measure all cabinet  surface temperatures of the heat exchanger and combustion section,  including the bottom around the outlet duct, and the burner door, using  the 36 square-inch thermocouple grid.
