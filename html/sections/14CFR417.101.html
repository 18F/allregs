If the FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that an applicable range safety-related launch service or property satisfies the requirements of this subpart, then the FAA will treat the Federal launch range's launch service or property as that of a launch operator without need for further demonstration of compliance to the FAA if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A launch operator has contracted with a Federal launch range for the provision of the safety-related launch service or property; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the Federal launch range's safety-related launch service or property satisfy the requirements of this subpart.
