No interest shall be paid on  any payment allowed under paragraph (c) of this section. However,  interest may be paid on any overpayment (as defined by section   6401) arising from a credit. See section 34(a), relating to credit for  certain uses of gasoline and special fuels, (and lubricating oil prior  to January 7, 1983). See section 6611, relating to interest on  overpayments. See Sec. 48.6427-3 for the time within which a claim for  credit or payment must be made under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The terms ``diesel fuel'' and ``special motor fuel'' have the  same meaning as in section 4041 and the regulations thereunder.

The amount of the credit  shall be an amount equal to the payment which would be made under  section 6427 with respect to fuel used during the taxable year for  passenger land transportation or school bus operations if section  6427(i) and paragraph (c) of this section did not apply. See section  34(a)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allowance of payment.
