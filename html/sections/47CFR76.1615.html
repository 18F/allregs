                                Sec.  76.1615  Sponsorship identification.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a cable television system operator engaged in origination  cablecasting presents any matter for which money, service, or other  valuable consideration is either directly or indirectly paid or promised  to, or charged or accepted by such cable television system operator, the  cable television system operator, at the time of the cablecast, shall  announce that such matter is sponsored, paid for, or furnished, either  in whole or in part, and by whom or on whose behalf such consideration  was supplied: Provided, however, that ``service or other valuable  consideration'' shall not include any service or property furnished  either without or at a nominal charge for use on, or in connection with,  a cablecast unless it is so furnished in consideration for an  identification of any person, product, service, trademark, or brand name  beyond an identification reasonably related to the use of such service  or property on the cablecast. For the purposes of this section, the term  ``sponsored'' shall be deemed to have the same meaning as ``paid for.''  In the case of any political advertisement cablecast under this  paragraph that concerns candidates for public office, the sponsor shall  be identified with letters equal to or greater than four (4) percent of  the vertical picture height that air for not less than four (4) seconds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each cable television system operator engaged in origination  cablecasting shall exercise reasonable diligence to obtain from  employees, and from other persons with whom the system operator deals  directly in connection with any matter for cablecasting, information to  enable such system operator to make the announcement required by this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the case of any political origination cablecast matter or any  origination cablecast matter involving the discussion of public  controversial issues for which any film, record, transcription, talent,  script, or other material or service of any kind is furnished, either  directly or indirectly, to a cable television system operator as an  inducement for cablecasting such matter, an announcement shall be made  both at the beginning and conclusion of such cablecast on which such  material or service is used that such film, record, transcription,  talent, script, or other material or service has been furnished to such  cable television system operator in connection with the transmission of  such cablecast matter: Provided, however, that in the case of any  cablecast of 5 minutes' duration or less, only one such announcement  need be made either at the beginning or conclusion of the cablecast.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The announcement required by this section shall, in addition to  stating the fact that the origination cablecasting matter was sponsored,  paid for or furnished, fully and fairly disclose the true identity of  the person or persons, or corporation, committee, association or other  unincorporated group, or other entity by whom or on whose behalf such  payment is made or promised, or from whom or on whose behalf such  services or other valuable consideration is received, or by whom the  material or services referred to in paragraph (c) of this section are  furnished. Where an agent or other person or entity contracts or  otherwise makes arrangements with a cable television system operator on  behalf of another, and such fact is known or by the exercise of  reasonable diligence, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section,  could be known to the system operator, the announcement shall disclose  the identity of the person or persons or entity on whose behalf such  agent is acting instead of the name of such agent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the case of an origination cablecast advertising commercial  products or services, an announcement stating the sponsor's corporate or  trade name, or the name of the sponsor's product, when it is clear that  the mention of the name of the product constitutes a sponsorship  identification, shall be deemed sufficient for the purposes of this  section and only one such announcement need be made at   any time during the course of the cablecast.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The announcement otherwise required by this section is waived  with respect to the origination cablecast of ``want ad'' or classified  advertisements sponsored by an individual. The waiver granted in this  paragraph shall not extend to a classified advertisement or want ad  sponsorship by any form of business enterprise, corporate or otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The announcements required by this section are waived with  respect to feature motion picture film produced initially and primarily  for theatre exhibition.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec.  76.1615(g): The waiver heretofore granted by the  Commission in its Report and Order, adopted November 16, 1960 (FCC 60- 1369; 40 FCC 95), continues to apply to programs filmed or recorded on  or before June 20, 1963, when Sec.  73.654(e) of this chapter, the  predecessor television rule, went into effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Commission interpretations in connection with the provisions of  the sponsorship identification rules for the broadcasting services are  contained in the Commission's Public Notice, entitled ``Applicability of  Sponsorship Identification Rules,'' dated May 6, 1963 (40 FCC 141), as  modified by Public Notice, dated April 21, 1975 (FCC 75-418). Further  interpretations are printed in full in various volumes of the Federal  Communications Commission Reports. The interpretations made for the  broadcasting services are equally applicable to origination  cablecasting.</p>
