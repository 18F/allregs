                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of identifying excess emissions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All CEMS data must be reduced to hourly averages as specified in Sec. 60.13(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each unit operating hour in which a valid hourly average, as described in Sec. 60.4345(b), is obtained for both NOX and diluent monitors, the data acquisition and handling system must calculate and record the hourly NOX emission rate in units of ppm or

lb/MMBtu, using the appropriate equation from method 19 in appendix A of this part. For any hour in which the hourly average O2 concentration exceeds 19.0 percent O2 (or the hourly average CO2 concentration is less than 1.0 percent CO2), a diluent cap value of 19.0 percent O2 or 1.0 percent CO2 (as applicable) may be used in the emission calculations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Correction of measured NOX concentrations to 15 percent O2 is not allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you have installed and certified a NOX diluent CEMS to meet the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, states can approve that only quality assured data from the CEMS shall be used to identify excess emissions under this subpart. Periods where the missing data substitution procedures in subpart D of part 75 are applied are to be reported as monitor downtime in the excess emissions and monitoring performance report required under Sec. 60.7(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All required fuel flow rate, steam flow rate, temperature, pressure, and megawatt data must be reduced to hourly averages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Calculate the hourly average NOX emission rates, in units of the emission standards under Sec. 60.4320, using either ppm for units complying with the concentration limit or the following equation for units complying with the output based standard:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For simple-cycle operation:</p><p class="depth3">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JY06.000</p><p class="depth3">Where:
E = hourly NOX emission rate, in lb/MWh,(NOX)h = hourly NOX emission rate, in</p><p class="depth3">lb/MMBtu,(HI)h = hourly heat input rate to the unit, in MMBtu/h,</p><p class="depth3">measured using the fuel flowmeter(s), e.g., calculated using</p><p class="depth3">Equation D-15a in appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, andP = gross energy output of the combustion turbine in MW.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For combined-cycle and combined heat and power complying with the output-based standard, use Equation 1 of this subpart, except that the gross energy output is calculated as the sum of the total electrical and mechanical energy generated by the combustion turbine, the additional electrical or mechanical energy (if any) generated by the steam turbine following the heat recovery steam generator, and 100 percent of the total useful thermal energy output that is not used to generate additional electricity or mechanical output, expressed in equivalent MW, as in the following equations:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JY06.001

Po = other useful heat recovery, measured relative to ISO conditions,</p><p class="depth3">not used for steam generation or performance enhancement of</p><p class="depth3">the combustion turbine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For mechanical drive applications complying with the output-based standard, use the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JY06.003
Where:
E = NOX emission rate in lb/MWh,(NOX)m = NOX emission rate in lb/h,BL = manufacturer's base load rating of turbine, in MW, andAL = actual load as a percentage of the base load.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For simple cycle units without heat recovery, use the calculated hourly average emission rates from paragraph (f) of this section to assess excess emissions on a 4-hour rolling average basis, as described in Sec. 60.4380(b)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For combined cycle and combined heat and power units with heat recovery, use the calculated hourly average

emission rates from paragraph (f) of this section to assess excess emissions on a 30 unit operating day rolling average basis, as described in Sec. 60.4380(b)(1).</p>
