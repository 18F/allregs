                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Charging interest--notice and rate. OMB may begin assessing  interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following  the day on which the billing was sent. The fact that the fee has been  received by OMB within the thirty day grace period, even if not  processed, will suffice to stay the accrual of interest. Interest will  be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 of the United  States Code and will accrue from the date of the billing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Charges for unsuccessful search. OMB may assess charges for time  spent searching, even if it fails to locate the records or if records  located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. If OMB estimates  that search charges are likely to exceed $25, it shall notify the  requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has  indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those  anticipated. Such a notice shall offer the requester the opportunity to  confer with agency personnel with the object of reformulating the  request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Aggregating requests. A requester may not file multiple requests  at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents,  solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When OMB reasonably believes  that a requester, or a group of requestors acting in concert, has  submitted requests that constitute a single request, involving clearly  related matters, OMB may aggregate those requests and charge  accordingly. One element to be considered in determining whether a  belief would be reasonable is the time period over which the requests  have occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Advance payments. OMB may not require a requester to make an  advance payment, i.e., payment before work is commenced or continued on  a request, unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OMB estimates or determines that allowable charges that a  requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. Then, OMB  will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory  assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt  payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to  the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of  payment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a  timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing). Then,  OMB may require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any  applicable interest as provided above or demonstrate that he or she has,  in fact, paid the fee, and to make   an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the  agency begins to process a new request or a pending request from that  requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When OMB acts under paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, the  administrative time limits prescribed in the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)  (i.e., 20 working days from receipt of initial requests and 20 working  days from receipt of appeals from initial denial, plus permissible  extensions of these time limits), will begin only after OMB has received  fee payments described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365). OMB  should comply with provisions of the Debt Collection Act, including  disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection  agencies, where appropriate, to encourage repayment.
