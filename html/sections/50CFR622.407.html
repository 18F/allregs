                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Minimum size limits. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No person may possess a spiny lobster in or from the EEZ with a carapace length of 3.0 inches (7.62 cm) or less; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A spiny lobster, harvested in the EEZ by means other than diving, with a carapace length of 3.0 inches (7.62 cm) or less must be returned immediately to the water unharmed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No person may harvest or attempt to harvest a spiny lobster by diving in the EEZ unless he or she possesses, while in the water, a measuring device capable of measuring the carapace length. A spiny lobster captured by a diver must be measured in the water using such measuring device and, if the spiny lobster has a carapace length of 3.0 inches (7.62 cm) or less, it must be released unharmed immediately without removal from the water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Aboard a vessel authorized under paragraph (d) of this section to possess a separated spiny lobster tail, no person may possess in or from the EEZ a separated spiny lobster tail with a tail length less than 5.5 inches (13.97 cm).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Berried lobsters. A berried (egg-bearing) spiny lobster in or from the EEZ must be returned immediately to the water unharmed. If found in a trap in the EEZ, a berried spiny lobster may not be retained in the trap. A berried spiny lobster in or from the EEZ may not be stripped of its eggs or otherwise molested. The possession of a spiny lobster, or part thereof, in or from the EEZ from which eggs, swimmerettes, or pleopods have been removed or stripped is prohibited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Undersized attractants. A live spiny lobster under the minimum size limit specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that is harvested in the EEZ by a trap may be retained aboard the harvesting vessel for future use as an attractant in a trap provided it is held in a live well aboard the vessel. No more than fifty undersized spiny lobsters, and one per trap aboard the vessel, whichever is greater, may be retained aboard for use as attractants. The live well must provide a minimum of \3/4\ gallons (1.7 liters) of seawater per spiny

lobster. An undersized spiny lobster so retained must be released to the water alive and unharmed immediately upon leaving the trap lines and prior to one hour after official sunset each day. No more than fifty undersized spiny lobsters and one per trap aboard the vessel, may be retained aboard for use as attractants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Tail separation. (1) The possession aboard a fishing vessel of a separated spiny lobster tail in or from the EEZ, is authorized only when the possession is incidental to fishing exclusively in the EEZ on a trip of 48 hours or more and a valid Federal tail-separation permit, and either a valid Federal vessel permit for spiny lobster or a valid Florida Saltwater Products License with a valid Florida Restricted Species Endorsement and a valid Crawfish Endorsement, as specified in Sec. 622.400(a)(2), has been issued to and are on board the vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Spiny lobster must be landed either all whole or all tailed on a single fishing trip.</p>
