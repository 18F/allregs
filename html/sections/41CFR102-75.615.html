                            <p class="depth0">HUD maintains responsibility for properties previously conveyed  under section 414(a) of the 1969 HUD Act. Property transferred to an  entity other   than a public body and used for any purpose other than that for which it  was sold or leased within a 30-year period must revert to the United  States. If the property was leased, then the lease terminates. The  appropriate Secretary (HUD or Department of Agriculture) and the  Administrator of GSA can approve the new use of the property after the  first 20 years of the original 30-year period has expired.</p>
