(See the ``Applicability and designation of affected facility'' section of the appropriate subpart.) For purposes of this paragraph, ``commenced'' means that an owner or operator has undertaken a continuous program of component replacement or that an owner or operator has entered into a contractual obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of component replacement.
