                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Criteria for establishment. As a general rule, if a person  intends to establish a bonded warehouse, other than one established on  the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant qualified for the  production of spirits or contiguous to such premises, the proposed  warehouse must have a minimum capacity of 250,000 wine gallons of bulk  spirits and the need for such a warehouse must be clearly shown. TTB may  consider an application to establish a bonded warehouse with less  capacity provided a need is clearly shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. The applicant must submit a separate written  request along with the application for registration explaining the need  for the bonded warehouse. TTB may approve the application for  registration if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proposed location for the warehouse will not jeopardize the  revenue; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant provides evidence showing sufficient need for  establishing such a warehouse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special conditions. Based on the application and request, TTB  may limit the type of operations that may be conducted at the bonded  warehouse. The proprietor of a warehouse approved for a limited type of  operation may not expand or change the operation to include any other  type of operation without application to and approval of the appropriate  TTB officer.
