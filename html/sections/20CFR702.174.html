The Director or his/her designee must review the application within thirty (30) days of its receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the application is complete and shows that all requirements under Sec. 702.173 are met, the Director must promptly notify the employer that certification has been approved and will be effective on the date specified.

The employer/applicant may reapply for certification, correcting deficiencies and/or responding to the reasons for the Director's denial. The Director or his/her designee must issue a new decision within a reasonable time of reapplication following denial. Such action will be the final administrative review and is not appealable to the Administrative Law Judge or the Benefits Review Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Director or another designated individual at any time has the right to enter on and inspect any facility seeking exemption for purposes of verifying information provided on the application form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Action by the employer. Immediately upon receipt of the certificate of exemption from coverage under the Act the employer must post:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A general notice in a conspicuous place that the Act does not cover injuries sustained at the facility in question, the basis of the exemption, the effective date of the exemption and grounds for termination of the exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A notice, where applicable, at the entrances to all areas to which the exemption does not apply.
