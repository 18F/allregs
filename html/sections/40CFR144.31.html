                                Sec.  144.31  Application for a permit; authorization by permit.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Permit application. Unless an underground injection well is  authorized by rule under subpart C of this part, all injection  activities including construction of an injection well are prohibited  until the owner or operator is authorized by permit. An owner or  operator of a well currently authorized by rule must apply for a permit  under this section unless well authorization by rule was for the life of  the well or project. Authorization by rule for a well or project for  which a permit application has been submitted terminates for the well or  project upon the effective date of the permit. Procedures for  applications, issuance and administration of emergency permits are found  exclusively in Sec.  144.34. A RCRA permit applying the standards of  part 264, subpart C of this chapter will constitute a UIC permit for  hazardous waste injection wells for which the technical standards in  part 146 of this chapter are not generally appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Who applies? When a facility or activity is owned by one person  but is operated by another person, it is the operator's duty to obtain a  permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time to apply. Any person who performs or proposes an  underground injection for which a permit is or will be required shall  submit an application to the Director in accordance with the UIC program  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For existing wells, as expeditiously as practicable and in  accordance with the schedule in any program description under Sec.   145.23(f) or (for EPA administered programs) on a schedule established  by the Regional Administrator, but no later than 4 years from the  approval or promulgation of the UIC program, or as required under Sec.   144.14(b) for wells injecting hazardous waste. For EPA administered  programs the owner or operator of Class I or III wells shall submit a  complete permit application no later than 1 year after the effective  date of the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For new injection wells, except new wells in projects authorized  under Sec.  144.21(d) or authorized by an existing area permit under  Sec.  144.33(c), a reasonable time before construction is expected to  begin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Completeness. The Director shall not issue a permit before  receiving a complete application for a permit except for emergency  permits. An application for a permit is complete when the Director  receives an application form and any supplemental information which are  completed to his or her satisfaction. The completeness of any  application for a permit shall be judged independently of the status of  any other permit application or permit for the same facility or  activity. For EPA-administered programs, an application which is  reviewed under Sec.  124.3 is complete when the Director receives either  a complete application or the information listed in a notice of  deficiency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Information requirements. All applicants for Class I, II, III,  and V permits shall provide the following information to the Director,  using the application form provided by the Director. Applicants for  Class VI permits shall follow the criteria provided in Sec.  146.82 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The activities conducted by the applicant which require it to  obtain permits under RCRA, UIC, the National Pollution Discharge  Elimination system (NPDES) program under the Clean Water Act, or the  Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program under the Clean  Air Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name, mailing address, and location of the facility for which  the application is submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Up to four SIC codes which best reflect the principal products  or services provided by the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The operator's name, address, telephone number, ownership  status, and status as Federal, State, private, public, or other entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether the facility is located on Indian lands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A listing of all permits or construction approvals received or  applied for under any of the following programs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Hazardous Waste Management program under RCRA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> UIC program under SDWA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> NPDES program under CWA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program under the  Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Nonattainment program under the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> National Emission Standards for Hazardous Pollutants (NESHAPS)  preconstruction approval under the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Ocean dumping permits under the Marine Protection Research and  Sanctuaries Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Dredge and fill permits under section 404 of CWA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Other relevant environmental permits, including State permits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A topographic map (or other map if a topographic map is  unavailable) extending one mile beyond the property boundaries of the  source depicting the facility and each of its intake and discharge  structures; each of its hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal  facilities; each well where fluids from the facility are injected  underground; and those wells, springs, and other surface water bodies,  and drinking water wells listed in public records or otherwise known to  the applicant within a quarter mile of the facility property boundary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A brief description of the nature of the business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> For EPA-administered programs, the applicant shall identify and  submit on a list with the permit application the names and addresses of  all owners of record of land within one-quarter mile of the facility  boundary. This requirement may be waived by the Regional Administrator  where the site is located in a populous area and the Regional  Administrator determines that the requirement would be impracticable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A plugging and abandonment plan that meets the requirements of  Sec.  146.10 of this chapter and is acceptable to the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Recordkeeping. Applicants shall keep records of all data used to  complete permit applications and any supplemental information submitted  under Sec.  144.31 for a period of at least 3 years from the date the  application is signed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Information Requirements for Class I Hazardous Waste Injection  Wells Permits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following information is required for each active  Class I hazardous waste injection well at a facility seeking a UIC  permit:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Dates well was operated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specification of all wastes which have been injected in the  well, if available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator of any facility containing one or more  active hazardous waste injection wells must submit all available  information pertaining to any release of hazardous waste or constituents  from any active hazardous waste injection well at the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator of any facility containing one or more  active Class I hazardous waste injection wells must conduct such  preliminary site investigations as are necessary to determine whether a  release is occurring, has occurred, or is likely to have occurred.
