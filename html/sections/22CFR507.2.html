The  Broadcasting Board of Governors is a government agency headed by a nine- member board, eight of whom are appointed by the President with the  advice and consent of the   Senate, and the ninth being the Secretary of State. Therefore, the  Broadcasting Board of Governors is an ``agency'' under these terms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term meeting means the deliberation of this Board where such  deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of  official Board business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term member means an individual who belongs to the Board who  has been appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate or is  the Secretary of State.</p>
