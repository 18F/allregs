                                Sec.  141.854  Routine monitoring requirements for non-community
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) The provisions of this section apply to non-community water systems using only ground water (except ground water under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in Sec.  141.2) and serving 1,000 or fewer people.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Following any total coliform-positive sample taken under the provisions of this section, systems must comply with the repeat monitoring requirements and E. coli analytical requirements in Sec.  141.858.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Once all monitoring required by this section and Sec.  141.858 for a calendar month has been completed, systems must determine whether any coliform treatment technique triggers specified in Sec.  141.859 have been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments as required by Sec.  141.859.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For the purpose of determining eligibility for remaining on or qualifying for quarterly monitoring under the provisions of paragraphs (f)(4) and (g)(2), respectively, of this section for transient non-community water systems, the State may elect to not count monitoring violations under Sec.  141.860(c)(1) of this part if the missed sample is collected no later than the end of the monitoring period following the monitoring period in which the sample was missed. The system must collect the make-up sample in a different week than the routine sample for that monitoring period and should collect the sample as soon as possible during the monitoring period. The State may not use this provision under paragraph (h) of this section. This authority does not affect the provisions of Sec. Sec.  141.860(c)(1) and 141.861(a)(4) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring frequency for total coliforms. Systems must monitor each calendar quarter that the system provides water to the public, except for seasonal systems or as provided under paragraphs (c) through (h) and (j) of this section. Seasonal systems must meet the monitoring requirements of paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transition to subpart Y. (1) Systems, including seasonal systems, must continue to monitor according to the total coliform monitoring schedules under Sec.  141.21 that were in effect on March 31, 2016, unless any of the conditions for increased monitoring in paragraph (f) of this section are triggered on or after April 1, 2016, or unless otherwise directed by the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Beginning April 1, 2016, the State must perform a special monitoring evaluation during each sanitary survey to review the status of the system, including the distribution system, to determine whether the system is on an appropriate monitoring schedule. After the State has performed the special monitoring evaluation during each sanitary survey, the State may modify the system's monitoring schedule, as necessary, or it may allow the system to stay on its existing monitoring schedule, consistent with the provisions of this section. The State may not allow systems to begin less frequent monitoring under the special monitoring evaluation unless the system has already met the applicable criteria for less frequent monitoring in this section. For seasonal systems on quarterly or annual monitoring, this evaluation must include review of the approved sample siting plan, which must designate the time period(s) for monitoring based on site-specific considerations (e.g., during periods of highest demand or highest vulnerability to contamination). The seasonal system

must collect compliance samples during these time periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Annual site visits. Beginning no later than calendar year 2017, systems on annual monitoring, including seasonal systems, must have an initial and recurring annual site visit by the State that is equivalent to a Level 2 assessment or an annual voluntary Level 2 assessment that meets the criteria in Sec.  141.859(b) to remain on annual monitoring. The periodic required sanitary survey may be used to meet the requirement for an annual site visit for the year in which the sanitary survey was completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Criteria for annual monitoring. Beginning April 1, 2016, the State may reduce the monitoring frequency for a well-operated ground water system from quarterly routine monitoring to no less than annual monitoring, if the system demonstrates that it meets the criteria for reduced monitoring in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section, except for a system that has been on increased monitoring under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. A system on increased monitoring under paragraph (f) of this section must meet the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section to go to quarterly monitoring and must meet the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section to go to annual monitoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The system has a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 months;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The most recent sanitary survey shows that the system is free of sanitary defects or has corrected all identified sanitary defects, has a protected water source, and meets approved construction standards; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The State has conducted an annual site visit within the last 12 months and the system has corrected all identified sanitary defects. The system may substitute a Level 2 assessment that meets the criteria in Sec.  141.859(b) for the State annual site visit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Increased monitoring requirements for systems on quarterly or annual monitoring. A system on quarterly or annual monitoring that experiences any of the events identified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(4) of this section must begin monthly monitoring the month following the event. A system on annual monitoring that experiences the event identified in paragraphs (f)(5) of this section must begin quarterly monitoring the quarter following the event. The system must continue monthly or quarterly monitoring until the requirements in paragraph (g) of this section for quarterly monitoring or paragraph (h) of this section for annual monitoring are met. A system on monthly monitoring for reasons other than those identified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(4) of this section is not considered to be on increased monitoring for the purposes of paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The system triggers a Level 2 assessment or two Level 1 assessments under the provisions of Sec.  141.859 in a rolling 12-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The system has an E. coli MCL violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The system has a coliform treatment technique violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The system has two subpart Y monitoring violations or one subpart Y monitoring violation and one Level 1 assessment under the provisions of Sec.  141.859 in a rolling 12-month period for a system on quarterly monitoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The system has one subpart Y monitoring violation for a system on annual monitoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Requirements for returning to quarterly monitoring. The State may reduce the monitoring frequency for a system on monthly monitoring triggered under paragraph (f) of this section to quarterly monitoring if the system meets the criteria in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Within the last 12 months, the system must have a completed sanitary survey or a site visit by the State or a voluntary Level 2 assessment by a party approved by the State, be free of sanitary defects, and have a protected water source; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The system must have a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Requirements for systems on increased monitoring to qualify for annual monitoring. The State may reduce the monitoring frequency for a system on increased monitoring under paragraph (f) of this section if the system meets

the criteria in paragraph (g) of this section plus the criteria in paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An annual site visit by the State and correction of all identified sanitary defects. The system may substitute a voluntary Level 2 assessment by a party approved by the State for the State annual site visit in any given year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The system must have in place or adopt one or more additional enhancements to the water system barriers to contamination in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (h)(2)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cross connection control, as approved by the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An operator certified by an appropriate State certification program or regular visits by a circuit rider certified by an appropriate State certification program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Continuous disinfection entering the distribution system and a residual in the distribution system in accordance with criteria specified by the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Demonstration of maintenance of at least a 4-log removal or inactivation of viruses as provided for under Sec.  141.403(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Other equivalent enhancements to water system barriers as approved by the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Seasonal systems. (1) Beginning April 1, 2016, all seasonal systems must demonstrate completion of a State-approved start-up procedure, which may include a requirement for startup sampling prior to serving water to the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A seasonal system must monitor every month that it is in operation unless it meets the criteria in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section to be eligible for monitoring less frequently than monthly beginning April 1, 2016, except as provided under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Seasonal systems monitoring less frequently than monthly must have an approved sample siting plan that designates the time period for monitoring based on site-specific considerations (e.g., during periods of highest demand or highest vulnerability to contamination). Seasonal systems must collect compliance samples during this time period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To be eligible for quarterly monitoring, the system must meet the criteria in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To be eligible for annual monitoring, the system must meet the criteria under paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The State may exempt any seasonal system from some or all of the requirements for seasonal systems if the entire distribution system remains pressurized during the entire period that the system is not operating, except that systems that monitor less frequently than monthly must still monitor during the vulnerable period designated by the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Additional routine monitoring the month following a total coliform-positive sample. Systems collecting samples on a quarterly or annual frequency must conduct additional routine monitoring the month following one or more total coliform-positive samples (with or without a Level 1 treatment technique trigger). Systems must collect at least three routine samples during the next month, except that the State may waive this requirement if the conditions of paragraph (j)(1), (2), or (3) of this section are met. Systems may either collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month or may collect all required routine samples on a single day if samples are taken from different sites. Systems must use the results of additional routine samples in coliform treatment technique trigger calculations under Sec.  141.859(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State may waive the requirement to collect three routine samples the next month in which the system provides water to the public if the State, or an agent approved by the State, performs a site visit before the end of the next month in which the system provides water to the public. Although a sanitary survey need not be performed, the site visit must be sufficiently detailed to allow the State to determine whether additional monitoring and/or any corrective action is needed. The State cannot approve an employee of the system to perform this site visit, even if the employee is an agent approved by the State to perform sanitary surveys.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State may waive the requirement to collect three routine samples

the next month in which the system provides water to the public if the State has determined why the sample was total coliform-positive and has established that the system has corrected the problem or will correct the problem before the end of the next month in which the system serves water to the public. In this case, the State must document this decision to waive the following month's additional monitoring requirement in writing, have it approved and signed by the supervisor of the State official who recommends such a decision, and make this document available to the EPA and public. The written documentation must describe the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample and what action the system has taken and/or will take to correct this problem.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The State may not waive the requirement to collect three additional routine samples the next month in which the system provides water to the public solely on the grounds that all repeat samples are total coliform-negative. If the State determines that the system has corrected the contamination problem before the system takes the set of repeat samples required in Sec.  141.858, and all repeat samples were total coliform-negative, the State may waive the requirement for additional routine monitoring the next month.</p>
