                                Sec.  141.854  Routine monitoring requirements for non-community
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of this section apply to non- community water systems using only ground water (except ground water  under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in Sec.  141.2)  and serving 1,000 or fewer people.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Following any total coliform-positive sample taken under the  provisions of this section, systems must comply with the repeat  monitoring requirements and E. coli analytical requirements in Sec.   141.858.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Once all monitoring required by this section and Sec.  141.858  for a calendar month has been completed, systems must determine whether  any coliform treatment technique triggers specified in Sec.  141.859  have been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must  complete assessments as required by Sec.  141.859.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring frequency for total coliforms. Systems must monitor  each calendar quarter that the system provides water to the public,  except for seasonal systems or as provided under paragraphs (c) through  (h) and (j) of this section. Seasonal systems must meet the monitoring  requirements of paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transition to subpart Y. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Systems, including seasonal  systems, must continue to monitor according to the total coliform  monitoring schedules under Sec.  141.21 that were in effect on March 31,  2016, unless any of the conditions for increased monitoring in paragraph  (f) of this section are triggered on or after April 1, 2016, or unless  otherwise directed by the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Beginning April 1, 2016, the State must perform a special  monitoring evaluation during each sanitary survey to review the status  of the system, including the distribution system, to determine whether  the system is on an appropriate monitoring schedule. After the State has  performed the special monitoring evaluation during each sanitary survey,  the State may modify the system's monitoring schedule, as necessary, or  it may allow the system to stay on its existing monitoring schedule,  consistent with the provisions of this section. The State may not allow  systems to begin less frequent monitoring under the special monitoring  evaluation unless the system has already met the applicable criteria for  less frequent monitoring in this section. For seasonal systems on  quarterly or annual monitoring, this evaluation must include review of  the approved sample siting plan, which must designate the time period(s)  for monitoring based on site-specific considerations (e.g., during  periods of highest demand or highest vulnerability to contamination).  The seasonal system   must collect compliance samples during these time periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Annual site visits. Beginning no later than calendar year 2017,  systems on annual monitoring, including seasonal systems, must have an  initial and recurring annual site visit by the State that is equivalent  to a Level 2 assessment or an annual voluntary Level 2 assessment that  meets the criteria in Sec.  141.859(b) to remain on annual monitoring.  The periodic required sanitary survey may be used to meet the  requirement for an annual site visit for the year in which the sanitary  survey was completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(3)</em> of this section,  except for a system that has been on increased monitoring under the  provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. A system on increased  monitoring under paragraph (f) of this section must meet the provisions  of paragraph (g) of this section to go to quarterly monitoring and must  meet the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section to go to annual  monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The system has a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12  months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The most recent sanitary survey shows that the system is free of  sanitary defects or has corrected all identified sanitary defects, has a  protected water source, and meets approved construction standards; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State has conducted an annual site visit within the last 12  months and the system has corrected all identified sanitary defects. The  system may substitute a Level 2 assessment that meets the criteria in  Sec.  141.859(b) for the State annual site visit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(4)</em> of this section is not considered to be on increased monitoring  for the purposes of paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The system triggers a Level 2 assessment or two Level 1  assessments under the provisions of Sec.  141.859 in a rolling 12-month  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The system has an E. coli MCL violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The system has a coliform treatment technique violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The system has two subpart Y monitoring violations or one  subpart Y monitoring violation and one Level 1 assessment under the  provisions of Sec.  141.859 in a rolling 12-month period for a system on  quarterly monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The system has one subpart Y monitoring violation for a system  on annual monitoring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(2)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within the last 12 months, the system must have a completed  sanitary survey or a site visit by the State or a voluntary Level 2  assessment by a party approved by the State, be free of sanitary  defects, and have a protected water source; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The system must have a clean compliance history for a minimum of  12 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An annual site visit by the State and correction of all  identified sanitary defects. The system may substitute a voluntary Level  2 assessment by a party approved by the State for the State annual site  visit in any given year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(v)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cross connection control, as approved by the State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An operator certified by an appropriate State certification  program or regular visits by a circuit rider certified by an appropriate  State certification program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Continuous disinfection entering the distribution system and a  residual in the distribution system in accordance with criteria  specified by the State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Demonstration of maintenance of at least a 4-log removal or  inactivation of viruses as provided for under Sec.  141.403(b)(3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Other equivalent enhancements to water system barriers as  approved by the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Seasonal systems. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Beginning April 1, 2016, all seasonal  systems must demonstrate completion of a State-approved start-up  procedure, which may include a requirement for startup sampling prior to  serving water to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through  (iii) of this section to be eligible for monitoring less frequently than  monthly beginning April 1, 2016, except as provided under paragraph (c)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Seasonal systems monitoring less frequently than monthly must  have an approved sample siting plan that designates the time period for  monitoring based on site-specific considerations (e.g., during periods  of highest demand or highest vulnerability to contamination). Seasonal  systems must collect compliance samples during this time period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To be eligible for quarterly monitoring, the system must meet  the criteria in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To be eligible for annual monitoring, the system must meet the  criteria under paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State may exempt any seasonal system from some or all of the  requirements for seasonal systems if the entire distribution system  remains pressurized during the entire period that the system is not  operating, except that systems that monitor less frequently than monthly  must still monitor during the vulnerable period designated by the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)(1)</em>, (2), or  (3) of this section are met. Systems may either collect samples at  regular time intervals throughout the month or may collect all required  routine samples on a single day if samples are taken from different  sites. Systems must use the results of additional routine samples in  coliform treatment technique trigger calculations under Sec.   141.859(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State may waive the requirement to collect three routine  samples the next month in which the system provides water to the public  if the State, or an agent approved by the State, performs a site visit  before the end of the next month in which the system provides water to  the public. Although a sanitary survey need not be performed, the site  visit must be sufficiently detailed to allow the State to determine  whether additional monitoring and/or any corrective action is needed.  The State cannot approve an employee of the system to perform this site  visit, even if the employee is an agent approved by the State to perform  sanitary surveys.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State may waive the requirement to collect three routine  samples   the next month in which the system provides water to the public if the  State has determined why the sample was total coliform-positive and has  established that the system has corrected the problem or will correct  the problem before the end of the next month in which the system serves  water to the public. In this case, the State must document this decision  to waive the following month's additional monitoring requirement in  writing, have it approved and signed by the supervisor of the State  official who recommends such a decision, and make this document  available to the EPA and public. The written documentation must describe  the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample and what action  the system has taken and/or will take to correct this problem.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State may not waive the requirement to collect three  additional routine samples the next month in which the system provides  water to the public solely on the grounds that all repeat samples are  total coliform-negative. If the State determines that the system has  corrected the contamination problem before the system takes the set of  repeat samples required in Sec.  141.858, and all repeat samples were  total coliform-negative, the State may waive the requirement for  additional routine monitoring the next month.</p>
